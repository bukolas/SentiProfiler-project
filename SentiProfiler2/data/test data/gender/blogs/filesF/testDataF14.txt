Great track workout! 3/4 mile slow jog, a bunch of drills (high knees, lunges, killer long jump things, etc.) Then we did a mile on the track, sprinting on the straight parts &amp; walking on the curves. Invigorating! Then a 1/4 mile cool down jog. Then one of the other girls and I did a mile jog--really nice way to wrap up an early morning workout! (Kind of stinks that w/the time change, the whole 5:45-6:45 workout was in the dark.) It still AMAZES me that, at the end of the workout, I can do a mile slow jog and talk the whole way through. I mean, my heart rate is still going up, and my lungs get a workout, but it's pretty easy. That's just crazy. And awesome. Total was 3 miles plus the drills. We were out there about an hour. 3.27 miles, 36 minutes, 11:00 pace. Okay, it wasn't a good pace, but boy was it a GREAT run. I focused on going slow, and was able to think more about lengthening my stride. I added a little speed at the end, but if I hadn't done that, I felt like I could have run for at least 10 more minutes. Maybe my easiest run ever. But still a good workout. I'm liking this slow jogging thing. :) Wow! Not the greatest energy today, but a great run! This is the furthest I've ever run, but just a bit (both time & distance.) I'm pleased that I focused on conserving my energy but was still a little faster than Thursday (even though speed isn't the goal right now.) Next week when I add 4 more minutes to my run I should be up over 3.5 miles. :) 3.39 miles, 36 minutes, 10:37/mile 3.03 miles in 33 minutes (10:52 per mile.) For my 10K training I'm focusing on SLOWING my pace so that I can run a bit longer each week and build up my endurance! This felt like a great, fairly easy pace for me. I was able to speed up just a bit in the last half mile, and I sprinted for the last 45 seconds. Knowing I had that extra energy at the end, I know I could have gone further. 6.2 miles seems a lot more attainable when I'm not pushing my speed! The trainer doing our Tuesday track sessions gave me advice on how to train for my April 4 10K. Here's the plan: Week 1 (this week): Track training 33 minute run 2-36 minute runs Week 2: Track training 36 minute run 2-40 minute runs Week 3: Track training 40 minute run 2-44 minute runs Week 4: Track training 44 minute run 2-48 to 49 minute runs So the idea is to increase my distance by 10% per week, and to run the whole way, no matter how slow I need to go. That way I've got the endurance to run most and maybe even all of the 10K. Running the whole way would be amazing but I'm not putting too much pressure on myself. That would be about 20 minutes longer than my longest training run. We'll see how much energy, motivation, and adrenaline I have on race day! Right now I think a reasonable goal for the 10K is 68:12 or less. That's an average of 11 minutes or less per mile. As I get closer, I'll reevaluate to determine if that still seems like a good goal or not. I'm starting weekly group track workouts with a trainer to help my running. Today we did a slow warm-up jog (3/4 mile), then did a timed mile. One mile time was 8:58! Personal best! I am thrilled to have run a mile in under 9 minutes! This was my first official 5K! My pace was just a smidge slower than last time I ran in my neighborhood. I think with the excitement I got off on my breathing, and I did a little bit of walking near the end because of some side cramps and just being winded. But it went great, and I can't wait to beat this time next time I do a race! Out of 181 women, I was #91, which puts me precisely in the middle of the pack. I'm pretty happy with that, with under 4 1/2 months of running under my belt Honestly, I was hoping to have my personal best time/pace, but it was still a really great experience. More interval training! Used one of Skip Orem's GetFitPod podcasts again. Man, it's HARD! My "sprints" are not very fast at the end! But I know it'll help my speed in the long run, and I enjoy the challenge. I heartily recommend these podcasts. Woo hoo--cut 48 seconds of my previous best 5K time!! Wow, that's getting very close to my 10 minute per mile goal! Tomorrow I'll do some interval training, then Sunday is my first official 5K. Hoping the adrenaline gets me down to my goal! 3.13 miles in 31:33, 10:04/mile
March 2002. It's March, and as such, I am going to pay homage to my little sister, Katie. For some reason beyond my comprehension, my little sister is such a muse to me when I'm making a cake. For example, she inspired this beauty of 2008. March 2008. And last year I designed a cute little button-themed cake that I never got around to actually making. :( She did get a cake, so don't worry about that! She and her winterguard cohorts celebrated with a Publix cake that day. This year, I definitely plan on making her another fabulous cake, since I'll be home for spring break, but I'm digressing... One of my favorite cakes ever was also inspired by and created for Katie: March 2007. Isn't it a beauty? All those different elements... the Royal Icing cauldron, the fondant leprechaun, the hard candy rainbow... If you were wondering, yes, I did make that rainbow all by myself. I made &amp; colored the hard candy all by myself, I melted it in the oven and made a rainbow shape and made a second one just in case this one broke... all on my own. And let me tell you, it was a lot of work! But so, so worth it, right? I can't take all of the credit either... Little sisters aren't good for much... ;) But my little sis has the ability to push my skills and talents past the limit and help me grow as a person... or at least, a cake decorator. So, Katie, this one's for you. For taking me out of my comfort zone and asking for the craziest, wildest cake ideas and believing that I'll actually be able to create them. Love ya, chica! If you noticed, there was recently a poll on the blog about your favorite cupcake flavors. According to TLC Cooking , these are the 10 most popular cupcake flavors: Chocolate &amp; Vanilla-- It's classic, simple, and has something for everyone. Red Velvet-- 'Nuff said Carrot Cake-- Vegetables in cupcake form? Oh yeah. Peanut Butter-- Why didn't I think of this combo?? Lemon-- If life gives you lemons, make lemon cupcakes Chocolate-- a personal favorite Coffee-- One of the few times I love coffee Banana-- I love banana bread but never tried a banana cupcake Pumpkin--&nbsp; one of my favorites Vanilla-- Booooring ;) And according to my blog readers, these are the favorites: Chocolate/vanilla combo-- Surprise! But what do you like better: chocolate icing with vanilla cake, or vanilla icing with chocolate cake? Chocolate with chocolate frosting Vanilla with vanilla frosting-- apparently y'all aren't very adventurous with your favorite cupcakes. Chocolate...vanilla...chocolate...vanilla... But the people have spoken! Strawberry and&nbsp;Red Velvet tied for fourth German Chocolate, Lemon, and Banana are fifth Carrot Cake, Coffee, Coconut, and Peanut Butter all got one vote each for 6th place Mostly I was just curious about what other people think of cupcakes. In my family it's pretty biased: the majority wants a chocolate cupcake, but there are strong contenders for lemon and vanilla. However, depending on how things go, I might put this information to use when (if) I participate as a vendor in my town's annual arts &amp; crafts fair. I want to sell cupcakes, cookies, and cake balls, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to, due to time constraints and the like. I'll be sure to keep y'all posted though! I haven't posted in a while, so I thought I'd share some of my older creations. First up, we have the truck road race cake I made for James' fourth birthday. He's 11 now, so that was seven years ago. (Wow! That was really long ago) What do you think? Has my decorating skills improved since then?? ;) Next up is a haunted house. I think I made this one four or five years ago. I was still learning about piping and coloring icing... so the coloring is a bit off. But those are some awesome ghosts, right?! And finally, the pirate cake. Man, oh man, I remember this cake. I definitely made it three or four years ago, and my blood sugar was screwing up, so I wasn't in my best creative mood. And the icing had little chocolate chips in it, which was way too frustrating. Ta-da! Not too shabby, all things considered. That's all the cake I've got to show off for right now. :-) I applied for some jobs this week, since I have a car now, so send some good wishes and prayers my way! I definitely want to start decorating cakes on a more regular basis. So these are the first ever Superbowl cookies that I ever made, way back in 2007. In '08 I made little footballs In '09 I made footballs and helmets As you can tell, I've come a long way since the Bears played the Colts. &nbsp;I now use Royal Icing instead of buttercream (and the proper consistency of RI) to decorate the cookies, and I found appropriate cookie cutters. If the horse looks a little funny to you, it's because I had to find a picture off the computer and trace that-- I didn't have a horse cookie cutter! (I do now, though, thankfully!) This year, unfortunately, I won't be able to make Superbowl cookies, since I'll be away at school, instead of attending the annual church party like I have the past 3 years. But I hope you enjoyed this little flashback into the past, and enjoy watching the game tomorrow night! (Or, not. I don't even think I'll be watching it, but who knows?) Today, two of my friends told me that they're working on a new project, involving their future career and/or favorite hobby. And I thought, I need a project of my own . So... if anyone could loan me an oven, a few pieces of wood, a jigsaw, an industrial-size mixer, and probably a blowtorch, I'll get to work on it. Or maybe I've just been watching too many episodes of Ace of Cakes? But in all seriousness, I did come up with a cool new cake design which may or may not defy the laws of gravity. It might have to be a summer project though, because it is seriously epic. More details later :D Everything hurts: My back is sore from leaning over. My legs and feet ache from standing up all day. My arms tire from kneading. My clothes and face and new apron are covered in sugar. But I couldn't be happier. I got to bake. And I believe, without a doubt, that baking is the surest way to cure stress. For me at least. There's just something so relaxing about going through the motions of rolling out dough, and thinking on your feet when you can't find an ingredient, solving problems like too-hot ovens, and finding the best creative way to decorate. I can just let go of all of my problems (and let me tell you, last week was problematic for me) and focus on that task in front of me. So thankfully my very good friend Joy took me home to bake with her and Megan and her awesome parents bought cookie mix and let me have run of the kitchen :) It may not have been the weekend I was hoping for, but I have a fresh outlook on life. Especially since there is a tupperware of a couple dozen sugar cookies (decorated with marshmallow fondant ... I actually did a pretty stellar job this time! I don't think anybody ever tells you what a sticky, gross mess it makes at first and how long it takes to knead, but by God, I did it right!) and a popcorn cake in my dorm. Life is good. I would like to sell some of my baked goods (cookies, cake balls, cupcakes, etc) this summer at our city's annual crafts fair. I remember last year I thought about selling crocheted items, but that is a lot of time to invest so I sorta scratched that idea. And I like cookies better anyway. :-) But I don't know what the laws are like in my state (Georgia)... do I need a licensed or commercial kitchen? Or is my home kitchen sufficient? Do I need a permit to sell at this festival? It's just a one-time deal, maybe I'll do it again the next year if it's a success. So if you know the answers or where I can find information, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!!! XOXO, Kelsie Ta-Da! Here are the finished cupcakes that I alluded to yesterday, and they are all in their entirety (unlike yesterday, when I started eating the gingerbread man before I took a picture). Oh, wait. That guy in front looks a little crippled. &nbsp;Well, to be fair, they are irresistibly yummy. I started out with a box of turtle brownie mix that my grandma gave me, and a sleeve of 500 Christmas cupcake liners. And so, the idea of brownies that look like cupcakes was born! Plus, it was a snow day, and I was stuck inside because of the below freezing weather and icy road conditions. Be warned, though, that the brownies stuck to the cupcake liners. Maybe it was the caramel? Or maybe I should've sprayed Pam on them first? I'm really not sure about that odd phenomenon, but if you have any ideas, let me know so I can improve next time. Then, since I had this really cute idea in my head about snowflake sprinkles and tiny gingerbread men, I wanted to decorate them... You can't really tell, but that's a 2-foot piping bag I've got in my hands. When I decided I needed a bigger bag to ice cupcakes with, I figured I'd just go with the biggest size available. Well... maybe an 18" bag would've done the job just as nicely, but without being quite so intimidating. Then came the sprinkles... And finally, the finished product! And many thanks to Sarah, who helped me out and decorated some of these cute little guys with me! I must warn you, though, that these are really sweet and rich. I think a normal chocolate cupcake would fare better with all the decorations, and leave the brownie cupcakes to stand on their own merit, with maybe a small swirl of fudge icing for garnish.

Almost a year ago today, I was told I had less than a year to live. After two months of deteriorating health, unsure diagnosis, wrong diagnosis's, different medications, and a mind full of questionable thoughts I was told what I feared the most. I didn’t cry that day, or the next. I accepted my fate and I remember just trying to show everyone in my life that it was okay. I came to really realize what the meaning, ‘everything in life happens for a reason’ truly meant. I figured that there was nothing but hard times to come and honestly I was okay with that. This past year has been difficult in many different aspects. I’ve watched my family and loved ones cry with tears of sorrow and tears of joy. I’ve had breathing tubes put in and taken out. I’ve struggled with learning to walk again, and being able to hear my own voice after four weeks of being unable to speak. I know that the ups and downs I faced last summer are never going to even compare to the things I’m going to encounter in the future because nothing was that difficult. If I were to experience this again, I would accept it as I did the first time around. Despite the hardships that came with what happened, I was surrounded by loved ones every single day. And if things were to happen differently, if things were to be worse, then that would be fine because I can’t change what’s already going to happen. The only things I can change are my attitude about it, and make the most out of what was to come. To be honest I never thought I would have had such a great turnaround. I remember thinking in the hospital that there wasn’t anything I could do, but when things started to look better, when I was still able to lift my left hand up, when I was starting to regain a little strength I knew I couldn’t waste it. I knew that I had to keep trying, keep fighting, and keep doing my best to get past whatever it was that was holding me back. Even to this day despite multiple doctors’ visits, MRIs, cardio appointments, etc, the doctors are still unsure of what exactly happened to me. They think it’s an isolated case, a onetime occurrence, but they said they couldn’t say that for certain. All I know is that without the love and support of the people around me, the people I don’t know, the amazing hospital staff at Children’s (21 is the age limit there! Aha!) I wouldn’t be where I am today. You all made me keep fighting, you all gave me the strength I needed to push myself, your support kept me from giving up in the moments where that’s all I wanted to do. So thank you for your thoughts, for your prayers, and for just showing me love in the time where I needed it the most. And I hope that you all know I appreciate everything you’ve all done, and I care about each and every one of you (even if I don’t know you, or we don’t speak anymore). I wish you all the best, and I will keep doing my best to make a difference in this world and to show you all that your thoughts weren’t wasted. Hi everyone, I haven't updated this blog much lately on account of there isn't any news for me to share with you all in regards to my health, plus I update my personal blog. Other than the good news of my life has returned to normal, and whatever in my brain has been shrinking, there isn't much for me to add. I have a math final tommorow, and this quarter is pretty much over and done with. Also been working around 4 days a week. Been saving up money for my big trip. I thought you might all want to see the MRI's I had done, these are just two. My first one ever taken, and the circled red area is actually the inflammation (what I shall refer to it as) its' really big that's why the doctors were so insistant that it was a tumor. This was taken in June of 2008. This second picture is a different angle, and the circled area is the spot/what's left of the inflammation. It's pretty much smaller than a pea, which is great news. This picture was taken October 2008. A very big change in 5-6 months. I just wanted to say thank yuo all again for everything, and for keeping me in your prayers. Also I cut off about 3-4 inches of my hair yesterday, so here's what I look like as of right now! Maybe I should upload a video of me doing a strenous exercise or something to show you guys my progress! First of all, I feel exteremy lucky and blessed to able to share good, no great news with you all. It's almost as if I've been given another chance to make the most out of my life. God has blessed me with great people, and a challenge, that I am overcoming. Today I went to Childrens to get the results of my MRI from last week. The neurologist told me that they still don't have a clear idea of what it is, or what made it occur. The tests they sent out over the summer with my blood, etc all came back negative/normal. So that's a pretty good sign. Then she showed me pictures of my brain. She showed me the original MRI picture from back in August which showed a very large white spot in my medula, and then she showed me the picture from last week's MRI, and the white spot seems to almost be gone now. Which means that my brain is getting back to normal (the color), and it's only got a very little spot of gray/white left. So everything is getting better, and they want to keep me on surveilance for awhile. My next MRI is going to be in January before my trip, and then after that I only need to get an MRI every 6 months, so things are going good! Also on another note I recently came into news in regards to some people that I do not know. And it's really sad because sometimes its so hard to believe that some people are so unhappy to the point where they need to end their own lives. I know people suffer, and people hurt but I just wish people didn't hurt to that point, that extent. Life is so precious and we're all only given one. Maybe someone had a bad day, maybe someone had a lot of bad days, maybe it was just a fluke. I don't know, what I do know is that we all have the power to make other people feel better about their situations, whether it be by offering a smile, giving wave, being courteous, or even holding a door. We all have the power to do something and to brighten someones day, so we should. Why let people suffer quietly? Why let people harbor pain? Why let people think that no one cares when we do? This whole sitaution has changed my outlook on life, and the values of family and friends. There's never a moment now where I don't want to do something for other people, and it's not because oh 'I should', it's because I want to. And I hope you all want to bring happiness to others, even if you don't know them. Sometimes all they need is one person to show them that things can be okay, and that strangers care. You've all shown me you care and for that I am eternaly thankful, without it I don't know where I would be. For the past two or so weeks I've been having headaches, they're not bad headaches, nor do they hurt. They're just annoying, and on the same side of my head every time. So my follow up MRI and Neurology appointment isn't until November 17 and 18, however I saw my doctor on Tuesday and she made a call and I had an MRI this morning at 7:15...Which was very early, especially for me. I had to leave at 6 am! But the MRI went well, and I'm just waiting to hear from Neurology in regards to how the scan/my brain looks. I hope that things continue to improve for me, and apart of me knows things will, things always get better. But if they don't, then that's okay too, becasue everything happens for a reason. I'm not scared or worried in regards to any of this business going on, I'm just trying to make the most out of everything in my life at this point. School's not bad, but doing a full load online sure is not that fun! I started working again too, 4 days a week, it's not bad either. I need something to keep me busy. My friends have been great, hanging out, treating me like I'm normal again. Which I'd like to think I am, other than the fact that I have to take heart medication. I feel like things are normal for me again, and I feel my old life habits resurfacing. Althoguh some are difficult to ignore, others aren't. I still am striving towrads a better life, etc. And today I realzied what one of my possible careers is/will be. I have a few, but this one I really want to see out. I'll update once I get the results of my MRI. Thank you for checking this blog, and for praying for me. I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate everything you have all done for me. The world needs more people like this. Also dont' forget to vote! Hey all, Some news for you, (finally an update) I had a cardiology appointment a week or two ago, and they said that basically I'm giong to have to stasy on my heart medication. I had a few episodes when I was in the hospital where my heart would beat up to 200 bpm. So anyway my heart still does a fast beat sometimes out of nowhere but not anywhere near as bad, almost like i went for a run and its beating, trying to slow down. I had a followup appointment wtih the whole rehab team today, and basically i'm doing really good. my strength's come back, etc. They even told me that they hadn't ever seen such a big turnaround ever. So my appointment went well, and i'm basically cleared for driving/traveling. Even though I started driving again a few weeks ago aha! I have a followup with Neurology in November and another MRI in November, and hopefully it shows another improvement! On another note, tommorow is my last day of Physical Therapy! :) Thank you all for the continued prayers. Sorry for the delay, it's hard to come up with things to say especially when your days consist of physical therapy, exercises, and hanging out. I thought it would be boring and repetitive to tell you all the same thing, over and over again. Anyways I've got a slew of doctors appointments coming up in the next few weeks, (probably something I mentioned before). Things are going well for me, I'm still trying to do my best. I find myself growing snappier at my family over little things, and I'm trying to stop that because it's uneccesary. And besides a happy wennie is a better wennie! :) On to some intresting news! I finally got my new tattoo yesterday, I was stuck between two choices. The first was the word 'rescued' because I feel like everything that happened to me in a way saved my life. I mean it sounds stupid, but apart of me really feels as if this was supposed to happen. Almost like the life I was living before just wasn't good enough, and this thing that happeend to me, forced me to accept things that I didn't want to or could accept before, forced me to push harder, forced me to just be better, to live better. That's why I feel like this thing that happened inside of my brain rescued me, it rescued me from my own life. I don't care if people think it's stupid, or dumb because it's got meaning to me and that's all that matters. It's a reminder of what happened, and what I need and should strive towards. It's also on my right arm because 1) I've already got a tattoo on my left side and 2) its right under where they give me my IV's for my MRI's (just another reminder that I've still gotta keep pushing and giong). I'll try to come up with more intresting things to tell you guys, therapy is going well and the strength is returning and almost equal at least in my legs. I think it's almost the same in my arms too! I feel like my health is improving, and I'm putting on weight! Below is a picture of my new ink. Thank you for your continued prayers and good thoughts! I will do my best to update more frequently! Hi everyone, I've been home for almost two weeks now and things are going very well. The tingling and numbness I felt before I entered the hospital have gone, and I feel my body becoming normal again (back to what it used to). I still do physical therapy and I'm diong it three times a week, and after next week it'll be reduced down to two times a week. I'm able to sprint now and squat down, which dosen't seem like much but for me it's a big improvement. I remember the first time I tried to squat down I fell, also the pain in my legs is gone when I walk so it's easier for me now to be walking a lot. I have another followup in two months for my MRI, and a cardiology appointment in the next few weeks to see if I need to stay on my heart medicine, and a follow up with the rehab doctors (all my therapists too!) at the end of september to make sure i'm on track. I plan on doing a full course load at school this quarter, joining a gym, working on my business, and getting a job as a mentor at a non-profit clinic. Things are looking up and I'm pretty happy. Below is a picture I put together from my time in the hospital to show yuo all the differences. Thank you all again for everything yuo've done for me, and for praying for me and keeping me in yuor thoughts. I'm home! I've been home since yesterday and it's so nice to be back again. Things have been going pretty well here, I start physical therapy at Olympic on Tuesday for 3 days a week, my previous PT therapist only thinks I need it for a month so hopefuly its only that long! No traveling at least until January but that's okay, I decided not to drop out of school and continue to do a full load this fall all online though! The doctors still are unsure of my diagnosis. I had an MRI yesterday and it showed another slight improvement. My next one is scheduled for two months from now, which is when my follow up appointment is. Hopefully things continue to progress at this rate. :) Thank you all again for everything you've done for me!
Slickly produced programs were provided on chairs, but it was too dark for ad broads to read, even by the light of their iphones. So I had no idea that Ad Broad was a finalist. Honestly, hadn't seriously considered that a blogspotter who can't speak a speck of html could be thought of as a "hero of the internet." Halfway through the ceremony, my companion and housing host announced she wasn't well (maybe the chicken-fried chicken?) and I drove her home. What a thrill to receive news (via twitter of course) that Ad Broad won in the Advertising blog category.Congrats to all winners including Deep Focus, Firstborn, RGA and others. Lucky for us and appropriate to the category that prizes are items more practical than dust-gathering engraved statuettes: flash drives.  Thanks to you who kindly voted on this proposed panel last Fall, I'm on my way to Austin where @BettyDraper will be presenting a session on Brand Fiction: what the heck is it? What can it do for your brand? How to integrate it into current marketing efforts? It's been recommended as a top SXSW panel for business and highlighted in SXSWorld and by the sharp folks at Razorfish. If you're putting your SXSW schedule together, hope you'll consider joining @Roger_Sterling (Michael Bissell) and me at 3:30 on Saturday for "Rules of Brand Fiction from Twittering Mad Men." A little fun before happy hour! Brilliant marketing move for two companies: the newest line of Barbies will include men-Mad Men. According to the New York Times today
Some gorgeous flower pcs made by Rita Saardi as a premise of beautiful dancers wearing silk dresses for Peter Copping / Nina Ricci. I had blogged about Rita's beautiful work in a previous post here . This talented budding fashion designer (who is definitely going places) was recently invited by the house of Nina Ricci to collaborate with head designer Peter Copping for the Fall 2011 show. You can follow this exciting adventure with her on her blog here . You go girl! x Designed by Georg Bohle , this cool oak dining table neatly conceals an electric piano. Just lift up on the wooden tablet cut into one edge and you are ready to dazzle your dinner guests (via cribcandy ). I am so fantasizing about being living in a house like this. I love everything about it, everthing down to the pirate flag. (photography by Anitta Behrendt ) I simply love these dino wallpaper by Paperboy , the wallpaper specialists for boys. Would be lovely if they also had the decal versions of this of these dinosaurs! Available here ! I love these vintage lamps by Kathleen Hills. The vintage glass shades have been sourced by Kathleen and given a contemporary twist. I think thse beautiful hanging lights will add just the right touch of soft vintage style to any bedroom. I love the simple and modern look of these chairs by American designer Von Tundra . Built with domestic white oak, these chairs (named the prairie chair) are inspired by reductive modernism and the farmer-made furniture of the American Midwest. Designed by Elding Oscarson, the interior walls of this graphic design office in Stockholm are made up of literally thousands of magazines. I like how this original idea for a wallpaper reflects on the business of the graphic design company. Simple yet stunning! This grass green carpet is a perfect present for any football fan (young or old) and is designed by Karin Mannerstål. Karin is a multi-talented designer who is working with many different materials and media. She has, among other things, designed things for IKEA of Sweden. Available here
Post note: Little bunny died about three hours after I brought him in house. I'm sure the stress was just too much for him. He seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. It is all for the better. He was warm and cared for. I found a wounded bunny near a hay pile I was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. He had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when I was near by. His hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. He's alive, but I've had my Dr. Quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn't fare well with human interference even when well intended. I imagine a cat got him. I iodined it after saline bath. He is more alert than when I found him, and I have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. Not sure if he will make it. He'll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. He is calm when held. The wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. These little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. Life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. The conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. Lilly had her lambs last night. She finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. This early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. The male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn't happen for a few days or more.] The girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. Sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - I treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. Lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. She's a big girl who throws strong lambs. I was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. I tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of Lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but I guess Mlle. Nature just wasn't ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. Normally I wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it's sunny and warm, and Lilly is an old pro. It's less stressful than being separated from the flock. They develop so much faster - I find - when they can go outside. I want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- I have to say, I feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. The trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and Martyn, and it showed this season. We lost the stillborn girl, and I still fret about the surviving twin's rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. And relieved. As the last ewe to lamb, Lilly rests, and waits. And one of Audrey's boys catches some sunny zzzzz's. On what most likely was a chilly March 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at St. Mary's in Rochester, Minnesota, I came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 PM. And so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how I almost killed my mother on my birthday. Perhaps it is one reason I chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. In all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and I have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. Supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because I was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like JFK - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother's looks to JFK. I was compared to a lobster. And hours before I barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. Her untimely death led me to receive her name, Katherine, instead of Bridgette which my mother had picked out. I cant imagine being named Bridgette, although as a child I liked to tell this story, since Bridgette Bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, I thought BB was quite the cat's pajamas. So I can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold March night for my father. I wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. Did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? As I get older, 52 years older to be exact, I can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. But being true Minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. In time, my tastes changed to German chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. I still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. While I appreciate that I was born, I am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. In fact, I couldn't disagree more. It's an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. Miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. I get just about as much birth as I need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. I think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. It's a mess. In fact, it makes no sense. A creature pushed out of a keyhole - that's not beautiful, it's bizarre. It's a miracle, but it's not beautiful. But it's the only way to get a foot in the door, isn't it? Staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. But there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to Neil Young. No puppies. No showers on a hot day. No hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. No matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. That some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. The winds have come in, it's bone chilling. All day I was carried back to a place I liked to hide when I was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. Alone, I felt protected, but spooked at the same time. Rushing back to the house, I'd hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the Wizard of Oz. But home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. It wasn't messy. It's like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but I feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. Together with my flock, I experienced the trauma of last year's lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, I carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if I bump it just right. I realized it's my very own birth story, and it's required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. March 10, Post Note: Daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. They've made it 8 hours...we'll hope they do well tonight. They appear okay. I saw some tail wiggling while at the udder [ asign they are getting milk]. When I saw these pictures, I was quite amused at their expressions. Amazing how they adapt. We are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. These are Fern's lambs, now one week old. We had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. I knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but I like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. The new mothers can surprise you though - I once had a new mom waddling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. So last night I was pretty sure Nelly Moser would lamb. And she did. I have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother Nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. Arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. But she wasn't caring to them very proficiently- she wasn't licking them or chortling much. One was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. I checked her udder and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. I opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. I decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. Nelly was just a bit clueless, but she's adapting. She is chortling more, and can get them to the udder, but she's not as good as the pros at helping them 'get it". She did not dry them off well either, and I had to step in and help. Within a half hour, I had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. We will just have to watch them and see. In the last 3 hours, I think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. And the other girls wait...here's Lilly, who I'm sure will go soon. In fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. The rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs.
I've just got back from the hairdresser's, and talking to you. I left at 5.00, and have just got back. I don't know whether I should feel ridiculous or relieved. Maybe (and you know who you are) you'll email and let me know. 1 January 2010 From John O'Donohue (1956-2008), a blessing for your New Year: Beannacht ("Blessing") On the day when the weight deadens on your shoulders and you stumble, may the clay dance to balance you. And when your eyes freeze behind the grey window and the ghost of loss gets in to you, may a flock of colours, indigo, red, green, and azure blue come to awaken in you a meadow of delight. When the canvas frays in the currach of thought and a stain of ocean blackens beneath you, may there come across the waters a path of yellow moonlight to bring you safely home. May the nourishment of the earth be yours, may the clarity of light be yours, may the fluency of the ocean be yours, may the protection of the ancestors be yours. And so may a slow wind work these words of love around you, an invisible cloak to mind your life. Sorry haven't been here for a while. Trying to go forwards...Hope you are all well and using up the last of the year well. During the week I got onto a tube in London feeling very tired and despondent, as you often do cramming onto a tube at rush hour, and without a book to read I stared up at the adverts and amongst them was this poem. It is called 'Prayer' and was almost in answer to one in that moment, and was so lovely I thought I'd put it here. I hope you think so too... PRAYER - Carol anne Duffey Some days, although we cannot pray, a prayer utters itself. So a woman will lift her head from the sieve of her hands and stare at the minims sung by a tree, a sudden gift. Some nights, although we are faithless, the truth enters our hearts, that small familiar pain; then a man will stand stock-still, hearing his youth in the distant Latin chanting of a train. Pray for us now. Grade 1 piano scales console the lodger looking out across a Midlands town. Then dusk, and someone calls a child's name as though they named their loss. Darkness outside. Inside the radio's prayer - Rockall. Malin. Dogger. Finisterre Not sure why, but this poem seems appropriate today. Sonnet to Orpheus Oh you gentle ones, every once in a while step into the breath that is indifferent to you, let it be parted on your cheeks, behind you it trembles, reunited. Oh you blessed ones, oh you whole ones, you who seem to be the beginning of the hearts. Bow of arrows and target of arrows, your smile beams eternally with tears. Do not fear to suffer the heaviness, give it back to earth's weight: heavy are the mountains. Heavy are the oceans. Even what you planted as children, the trees, have long become too heavy; you could not carry them. But the breezes... but the spaces... Psalm 91 for my sins, this for pleasure. I wish I had written it... To An English Friend In Africa — Ben Okri Be grateful for the freedom to see other dreams. Bless your loneliness as much as you drank of your former companionships. All that you are experiencing now, will become moods of future joys. So bless it all. Do not think your way superior to another's. Do not venture to judge, but see things with fresh and open eyes. Do not condemn, but praise when you can, and when you can't, be silent. Time now is a gift for you. A gift of freedom to think and remember and understand the ever perplexing past and to recreate yourself anew in order to transform time. Live while you are alive. Learn the ways of silence and wisdom. Learn to act, learn a new speech. Learn to be what you are in the seed of your spirit. Learn to free yourself from all the things that have moulded you and which limit your secret and undiscovered road. Remember that all things which happen to you are raw materials. Endlessly fertile. Endlessly yielding of thoughts that could change your life and go on doing so forever. Never forget to pray and be thankful for all things good or bad on the rich road; for everything is changeable so long as you live while you are alive. Fear not, but be full of light and love. Fear not, but be alert and receptive. Fear not, but act decisively when you should. Fear not, but know when to stop. Fear not, for you are loved by me. Fear not, for death is not the real terror, but life magically is. Be joyful in your silence, be strong in your patience. Do not try to wrestle with the universe, but be sometimes like water or air, sometimes like fire, and constant like the earth. Live slowly, think slowly, for time is a mystery. Never forget that love requires always that you be the greatest person you are capable of being, self-regenerating and strong and gentle--your own hero and star. Love demands the best in us. To always and in time oversome the worst and lowest in our souls. Love the world wisely. It is love alone that is the greatest weapon and the deepest and hardest secret. So fear not, my friend. The darkness is gentler than you think. Be grateful for the manifold, dreams of creation, and the many ways of the unnumbered peoples. Be grateful for life as you live it. And may a wonderful light always guide you on the unfolding road. Today it was the smell of lilacs that got me. I turned a corner, on a road I'd never walked down before, quite close to home, and bang... There I was a child of seven or eight again, dragging her feet on the way to the big houses under the railway bridge, where on some Sunday mornings, a tiny lady who lived in one of them sold us rhubarb, and bunches of mint for potatoes. Delicious smells...but before we got to them, we walked with our huge bundles of rhubarb along a crescent-shaped road that was full of (what I now know to be) lilacs, and the smell cleared everything else from your mind. For a while, everything...One of the saving graces of childhood. To this day I love lilac - the colour, the smell, the look of them...and of course the way they make my mouth water for rhubarb crumble. I am at a writing course this weekend, given by the legendary Robert McKee — the Los Angeles writer of the book STORY. He is an amazing teacher. I did the London course 2 years ago too, and read his book (a month or so before my own book came out), but it has taken all this time to absorb what he had to say on the level it needed to be known at; I feel like I am finally mastering story, and all that instinctive way of writing is being tamed by proper plotting and structure. I am really excited that bits of the craft are finally slipping over from right to left brain; very excited... But as he says in his book, no matter how much you think you've got it sussed, you can't do it properly until you have actually done it! Here's something I re-read from his book last night, and which has stayed in my head all day. It's commonplace but something that really hit home...He says, once you've mastered the rules of story and the conventions of the genre you have chosen to write in, put away the rules and "Write only what you believe. Write your kind of story. The kind of story you’d stand in line in the rain to buy." What fantastic advice... '...the kind of book you'd stand in line in the rain to buy." (well, actually he says "...the kind of film you'd stand in line in the rain to watch." because his course is also for screenwriters, but it's relevant for all forms. Just a word of warning if anyone is thinking of going to his next course (and he does them in countries around the world)...Two years ago I got lambasted by him because my phone went off during the first day of the 3 day course, when he had forbidden us to have phones on in the auditorium. He fined me £10, the total sum of money I had on me for lunch, but he made me hand it over. (To this day I swear I don't know how my phone switched on, as I'm convinced I turned it off...). I was emotionally raw because my book was about to come out, plus all that ugly stuff that was going around about me at the time, false and malicious though it all was, had finally got to me, and so the emotion his 'telling off' brought about almost knocked me for six. I wouldn't have believed it possible to feel that much over 'relatively' so little...I must have been holding all that emotion in for all that time waiting for my book to finally go public, and there in that lecture theatre I almost went into meltdown. I had shut myself down over the years, especially all those months that I was living in the car, and almost never cried anymore, about anything.... But during the 3 days of the course, I couldn't stop. I just couldn't hold back the tears, and in fact it got so bad, that on the afternoon of the last day, as we all settled down for the screening of Casablanca, I had to leave. The crying was silent of course, or as much as I could make it, but it felt like a hand had passed into my chest and was squeezing my heart over and over again, big fist-sized handfuls of it, kneading it over and over like dough, and I almost couldn't see for the tears, or breathe for the pain of it. And although no one else in the lecture theatre seemed to notice (who doesn't cry at Casablanca?) it felt like somehow he knew...I don't know how, but it felt like he did...and as he passed behind my seat as he briefly left the theatre for a few minutes while we continued to watch Casablanca, he slowed down and seemed to look directly at me and tears were just streaming down... He must have thought I was mad...having a slight overreaction anyhow...I think he recognises me this time too. Maybe I am just imagining that, but... Anyhow, this year I have been smart enough to leave my phone behind — for that read, so terrified of it happening again that I didn't dare bring it along...The man's a genius, but you don't want to see his dark side...So be warned, if any of you decide to go to his next course, and I would absolutely recommend it, switch your phones off! You have been warned... I'm sitting here typing this under blue skies. The busy city street below my window is full of the smell of warm blossom and, now and then, when there is the occasional lull in traffic and all you hear is the slow swish of trees from neighbouring gardens and the call of birds in flight, you can close your eyes and think yourself almost anywhere. I love days like today.
I'm on the train as I type heading to Chicago on my way to meet up with Betsy Greer for programing at Columbia College this afternoon. It's so easy to forget that Milwaukee is only 1.5 hours away from Chicago, even after 9 years of living here it slips my mind. I can't wait to catch up with Betsy, I can't remember the last time we saw each other...But I think it was at the Portland premier of Handmade Nation last Spring. Man a year sure goes by quick. East coast peeps tell your friends that on Monday evening (March 8th) I'll be doing a screening at Syracuse University in the Watson Auditorium at 5:15pm, FREE &amp; open to the public. Have a good weekend everyone! I'm at my hotel in Baltimore . Just had a great screening at MICA that was full of really great folks. Tomorrow I head back to Milwaukee (fingers crossed the weather stays on my side) until next Thursday. In international news I just received a pdf from Vida Simples Magazine who did an article on DIY featuring the picture of Knitta &amp; Happy Owl Glassworks from Handmade Nation the book and also Sabrina's book Knit Knit . AND AND AND I got my tickets for my trip to Scotland this June where I will be doing screenings and workshops in Aberdeen and Dundee ! I am SO excited, I've never been to Scotland and can not wait to soak it in. Next Thursday I will be on a train to Chicago to the Cultural Studies Colloquium at Columbia College Chicago with my friend and colleague Betsy Greer . The programing starts at 3:30 with a screening of Handmade Nation and lecture by Betsy. It's free and open to the public. I'm off to slumber land, the wind here in Baltimore is howling louder then hounds. Quite down wind, this lady is sleepy. Well, it was official before but now with a new blog , twitter, flickr and facebook fan page it's the real deal. I start shooting with my co-director Sam Macon the end of March for the Sign Painter Movie . For those of you who are interested you can now download Handmade Nation from Amazon.com I haven't tried it, but here it is: I will be hitting the road again on Thursday jumping a flight West to San Francisco. I am staying with the lovely Lisa Congdon and will be screening in Oakland at Rock! Paper! Scissor! this Friday at 7pm. Do pass the word on and hope to see you soon! Part of my job is to stay on top of what's new and exciting going on within the creative world. I have found this to become more and more difficult as I struggle to keep up with Handmade Nation and the amazing opportunities that have come out of making the documentary, including the immense travel schedule that has become a part of my life. There is just so much out there, you know? So many of you are making exciting new things and documenting them in such beautiful ways. So my question is, where is the time in my day/week/month to read all of your blogs, ingest all your amazing lifestyles and inspiration? I mean, it's not like I'm out of touch at all, it's just that there is so much more than I can wrap my brain around. With this said, a few weeks ago Jan from Poppytalk (one of my favorite reliable blogs) got in touch as asked me to be a juror along with some other amazing ladies for her new awards she set up called " The Poppies ". Of course I said yes. The thing is, I often say yes to things I don't have time for but really want to do and per usual, I didn't think about the time involved with going through what ended up being 100's of links of those who were nominated for the categories. As a juror we were asked to pick 3 out of each category. Each category had anywhere from 20-50 nominations. There were so many amazing things and people who I hadn't seen before, it was really difficult to stay focused while clicking through all the nominee's. I had to develop a system so I could narrow it down a bit, so I made lists for each category of my favorite picks to then pick 3 from. The entire point of this post is to share with you my lists I made. I think there was so much talent showcased for the Poppies and if you want to see the jury choice winners go here. and the people's choice winners go here . Below are my "working" lists from when I was in the zone of going through 100's of blogs, shops and sites. I got really inspired &amp; hope you do too. Unfortunately I used my "stickies" to save my lists and they didn't save the hyperlinks, but I have linked each category to it's page so just scroll down once on each page and peep away!

The reasons I do love it is because I like finding out about things like " Typeface ". This is a new documentary (I have yet to see) about a very special place that just so happens to be in Wisconsin only a few hours away from me. This trailer is a kick in the butt to make my way up there very very soon. Keep an eye out on their website for screenings near you. Also, head on over to Blanket Magazine to download the new issue . It's not just any issue it's their 20th &amp; also the 3rd Birthday of the Magazine! You can see this feature with your's truly as well as interviews and artwork by a ton of people. There is also an amazing spread on jumping photos, which I am always a huge fan of (see below). A screen shot of my spread in Blanket Magazine Here I am jumping on my bed in Melbourne last year My time out East was fantastic. Like, super tops in all manners. Here is the quickest rundown possible of my 5 day jam packed trip. This is a long one.... January 15th, Day #1: The show I curated " New Work by Merrilee Challiss and Margaret Oomen " at Craftland Gallery opened. Merrilee flew in from Alabama and we all got to hang out. The show looks amazing, the work is stunning and I'm glad my hunch for showing those two together was correct. Read more about the experience here . Margaret Oomen, covered sea stones Margaret Oomen, covered tea saucers Merrilee Challiss, Babylon Garden Merrilee Challiss, Temple NOTE : Artwork is available for sale online HERE + Read about Margaret donating her sale proceeds to Haiti on her blog HERE . January 16th, Day #2: I got to do some putting around Providence with Merrilee before I dropped her at the airport before my screening later that evening. Deb Dormody recommended we swing by Wolf E. Myrow. If you are curious about a magic place filled with amazing things read more about it here . Later on in the evening I had my screening at Craftland, 2 sold out shows of 40! Goccoed tickets by Heather Toupin Craftland January 17th, Day #3: Said goodbye to Providence and drove through 4 states (this blows my mind since I live in the Midwest) in 2 hours to get to Portland, ME. I drove straight to Eli Phant (one of the event sponsors) to check out their store. If you get a chance go there the owners Sally &amp; Peter have curated an amazing shop that has all sorts of perfect handmade goodness. I can't tell you what I bought or it will ruin someone baby shower surprise.... I got a chance to finally see Ferdinand in person, have some amazing tea, eat an incredible dinner then we all zipped over to Space Gallery for the screening. 150 people came out for the event. It was awesome. Space Gallery Right after the screening I drove off into the night as to wake up at my friends house in Belfast Maine.... January 18, Day #4: I have a group of friends who have decided to make Belfast their home . I was there for the wedding ceremony last year and my second time back was just as amazing, just much chillier. One of the best parts of touring with my movie is I get to stay in touch with old friends, this is the perfect example. So breakfast was had then I headed over to Waterfall Arts for my Sunday matinee. Belfast, ME Feather, the three legged cat Skunk Man Waterfall Arts is this rad space with studios and a gallery. I was excited that 50 people came out on a gray Sunday afternoon to watch Handmade Nation . I drove for three hours after the screening since I was due in Boston the next day and there was supposed to be a big ol' snow storm. There was. January 19th, Day #5: I woke up to this: Lucky for me I was only an hour away from Boston. I was extra super excited because I was on my way to meet up with the lovely Meighan O'Toole who does the art blog My Love For You . Meighan and I had never met, but we have had many online discussions so both of us were really excited. She was sponsoring the Boston Screening that was happening at 4th Wall Gallery that night. Needless to say Meighan &amp; I hit it off super hard, so hard in fact I didn't take one single picture of her since we didn't stop talking the entire time. 60+ peeps came out to 4th Wall for the Boston screening that night, it was awesome. 4th Wall Gallery January 20th, Day #6 So tired from hanging out for a week straight, I had lunch with my uncle Hal &amp; flew home to Milwaukee. Thanks everyone who came out last week. It's much appreciated. Mucho much. The end. {More photos from the trip are here } First off, remember when Cortney Heimerl (co-author of Handmade Nation the book) was preggers last year and couldn't finish the last few dates of the book tour? Well, check out Abraham Edward at his glorious 7 months and how flipping cute he is. I'm a huge fan. Second, I am very much looking forward to my trip this week to Providence , Portland ME, Belfast ME and Boston for screenings ((details listed on the sidebar to the right)). I am super EXTRA excited for these reasons: #1. I curated a very exciting show at Craftland Shop with two amazing women, Merrilee Challiss &amp; Margaret Oomen AND I get to be there for the opening AND Merrilee will be there from Birmingham, AL where she lives and runs the bangin' spot Bottletree . I haven't seen Merrliee since she had a show at my gallery a few years ago and it is going to be FUN. So, if you know anyone in Providence, tell them to come to the show on Thursday, all the information is HERE . #2. I get to hang out with Deb Dormody who is one of the coordinators at Craftland, and also the talent behind IF'N Books + Marks . Her dude Alec is also a treat to get to see. Actually Providence is full of magic, it's one of my favorite places in the United States. I'm so hyped for the screening on Friday there. #3. I am hanging out in Portland Maine for the first time ever. #4. I get to go to Belfast to see my friends new baby Olai and do a screening at the same time. Last time I was in Belfast I went to this amazing wedding. #5. On Monday in Boston I FINALLY get to hang out with Meighan O' Toole from My Love For You , who organized the event there. That will be a treat. I'll do my best to update you from the road....Then it will almost be February. Holy crap. Back to work. Everything is a little backed up around here, I took some for reals time off the past two weeks. Had an epic dinner party at my house, took a trip to NY and ate a whole lot of amazing food. Yesterday &amp; today just sifting through emails and seeing where I left off. I'm feeling really good about this trip East coming up, so many good people to visit in Boston MA, Providence RI and the state of Maine. I am crossing my fingers that the weather agrees with my travel plans and will update you all with new projects soon.

We'll if you've been in any department store lately, you've seen all the cute summer clothes being replaced with winter. I guess seeing how we've officially had NO summer with all this rain, we might as well start getting ready for fall/winter.In doing so you have to check out these ADORABLE boots!...

I  didn't even know The Man in the Moon was in my queue til I got it, and I can't imagine why I would have possibly added it. According to Wikipedia, Reese Witherspoon's first movie "is notorious for a glimpse of the actress's underage, naked rear end." Hah. Anyway, it wasn't bad. It really made me want to move to a farm in the South. Reese, who I generally like, plays 14-year-old Dani Trant, who falls in love with an older guy who moves in next door (played by Jason London-the twin from Dazed and Confused and that Aerosmith video, not the one from Mallrats). He falls in love with her older sister, a girl who everyone spends the whole movie talking about how beautiful she is, which is kinda weird cause she has a mustache. There is lots of skinnydipping in the local pond. The dad is played by a guy from Law and Order I think. There is a really creepy scene where the older sister goes to a dance and gets groped by her date's father, then by her date. Anyway, eventually Dani finds out that the guy and her sister are sneaking around behind her back, but then Jason London is killed falling off his tractor, and then the sisters forgive each other. It was a pretty decent coming-of-age type movie--the acting was good, and it wasn't overly sappy, but it was kind of boring. It has that ubiquitous  teen movie scene where a tomboy type girl gets disgusted when she finds out that you kiss boys with her tongue, and then she practices on her pillow (or in this case, her hand.) At one point,
After finishing this, it occurred to me I had George MacDonald's allegorical fairytale Lilith in mind when working on it. George MacDonald was a good friend of Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) . The story is that of a sort of super-succubus who holds half the waters of the world in her hand. Her sin is in cutting off life, which results in her living a sort of half-life and doing harm to others. George MacDonald was quite an interesting character, a Presbyterian minister whose unorthodox sermons (he believed in that God was internal, and in love rather than doctrine) got his parishioners riled up to the point where he was essentially demoted from a parish with a good living to a less remunerative one. It's also interesting that C.S. Lewis was such an admirer of MacDonald, whose vision seems to me much more generous than that of Lewis.This (on Imaginary Bicycle) made me cry, in a good way.
I wrote this one in 30 minutes last night. Isn't it nice when the right guy gives you the right sort of inspiration? I was tempted to use his name, but alas, I thought I'd leave a little mystery this time around... I like the way you look me in the eyes I, I like the way you always make me smile And oh, you know I love the way that, if only for awhile, you make me feel like the only girl in the room Guess I never saw myself until I saw you It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open We have a lifetime of tomorrows But don't you always want to remember the taste of yesterdays? What if I told you our yesterdays were happening right now? If you fall, I'll be the one to catch you If you call, I'll be the first to rescue you Who says we can't jump with our feet still on the ground? It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open And as the days turn into years I'll still be the one here to catch you Baby, know that I'll never forget you... It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone?

[Photo via Le Love ] TO: Men all over the planet FROM: Melissa RE: Stupid stereotypes DATE: March 16, 2010 So, boys, you know how I'm always trying to drill those stupid disability misconeptions out of your beautiful minds? Well, stand-up comedian Ryan Niemiller has actually found a better way to do it. His A Guide to Dating for the Handicapped takes the humor route, and I couldn't have said it better myself... As someone with a handicap, I have had my fair share of troubles finding love. Luckily, all of my non-handicapped friends have been so kind over the years to help me along the way, and tell me how I, someone with a handicap, should date. I've compiled, in conjunction with Ally "Wheels" Bruener, this helpful list for anyone else here that might have a disability! I present... the Guide to Dating for the Handicapped! -Only look for others [people with disabilities]. -Never try to date up. You will fail. -Make yourself look as normal as possible. If someone is stupid enough, they may think you're normal. -Never complain about the fact that you don't have anybody. You're handicapped and supposed to be an inspiration. Don't be selfish. -Everyone that hangs out with you is paid to do so. Just accept it. -Don't ask for anyone to set you up. No one is going to be that mean to their friends. -If you are disabled, you must be asexual. -If you really want a date, try getting it setup through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It's your best bet. -Just accept the fact that a pat on the head from a little old man will be the most action you'll see. -Take some classes on counseling: You'll be the one everyone comes to with their problems. -If anyone actually offers to sleep with you, decline. It is a fraternity/sorority initiation prank. Or your parents paid them. -If you don't want to die a virgin, begin shopping around for the best-priced hooker immediately. -Never let your quest for a relationship get out to your family: They'll reassure that it just isn't practical. -Your non-handicapped friends are right - you're just being silly. -Society isn't as harsh as you think. You're just being overly critical. -Every member of the opposite sex you talk to will tell you there is someone out there for you - it's just not them. -You just aren't trying hard enough. -You're trying too hard. Just let it happen. -You want a family? Don't these supposed rules society buys into just look completely ridiculous and ignorant when seen on paper (well, on the screen) and listed all together? Don't they want to make you scratch your eyes out? Because you know I have a big mouth, allow me to add a couple of my own to round out the list... -Always have your date talk for you, cut your meat for you and tell people to move out of the way as you're coming through. Because, you know, you can't use your voice in public. Don't want to scare the little children, do you? -If the most action you ever get is looking into the gorgeous blue eyes of Silvio every time he comes to help you shower, be grateful. Silvio is your in-home health-care worker. -You're loved by your family. That's more than what some people have. Don't cry with a loaf of bread under your arm. Let me know, boys, when those guilty, oh-my-gosh-I-can't-believe-I-let-her-get-away feelings set in. Go ahead, boys. I'll wait. Heck, I've got all day - and night...you know, because it's not like I have a date or anything. xoxo [Photos via happythings ] I love the meaning behind these travel-themed engagement photo shoots. These couples look so happy and excited to be starting a new adventure in marriage, don't they? xoxo P.S. The Map Shoot is my favorite! Too bad there's not really a Map of Love somewhere out there! And the Plane Shoot makes me want to burst into my own rendition of Up Where We Belong . Sigh. P.P.S. Check out Beau-Coup's Wedding Blog for more awww-inspiring couples! The wonderfully insightful Kasey is back to share more tales with us this week (read his previous tales here + here ). And just so you know readers, these are in no way solicited by me, but I will say I'm loving his style, aren't you? xoxo Rule #11 Put your money where your mouth is. Guys, if you like a girl, you need either to pay or offer to pay for the evening. Period. Ladies, if you like a guy and you’ve been on a few dates, (and you’re not going to dump him), offer to pay every now and then. I typically refuse to let girls pay if I like them. But I love it when they ask. And if the ladies want to pay for their own, that is fine too. If a guy does not offer to pay, it is usually safe to assume that he isn’t that into you. If a girl wants to pay her own way, guys, let her. Actually, guys, let her do whatever she wants. Don’t screw it up. But AT LEAST OFFER to pay. You are not trying to buy your date, or buy sex, or any of those ludicrous ideas. You are simply saying, “I like you,” and proving it by how you handle your money. Rule #22 Always call with a plan. Recently, a girl friend of mine received a call (from a guy who supposedly likes her) where his only question was, “Can I call you tomorrow to see when you’re free?” Let this sink in. Read it again.... Exactly. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. He had her on the phone already...wouldn’t it make sense to just ask her when she was free? Yes. People are actually this silly. Anyway, the point is, always call with a plan. Even if the plan is just to talk about the other person’s day. That counts, because you’re talking, building communication skills, and (hopefully) getting to know more about the other person’s likes and dislikes (so you can pull out that information when it really counts). Guys, unless it is too late to go do something, you always need to have a plan that puts the two of you together. Suggestions include movies, dinner, walks in the park, heck, you can even walk around Wal-mart and do some grocery shopping! I like asking girls if they would like to play with my Wii. Oddly enough, they like it!!! :) It is OK if the girl wants to change the plan. Just make sure you have thought of something. Especially avoid this exchange: “What do you want to do?” “I don’t know, what do you want to do?” “I don’t know...maybe...well....what do you want to do?” NO, NO, NO! If all else fails, say, “I want to see you!!” That, at least, is the truth. [Photos via We Heart It ] Prologue : You know your nonexistent love life has become close to extinction territory when your own mother makes you feel as though it's the most ludicrioous idea in the world that you could possibly be interested in or even have a chance with a romantic beau. I had another one of those invisibility moments last week. You know the kind, friends...where you're just standing there and wishing you had a white flag that you could wave wildly in the air and scream, " HELLO, I'm right here, aren't I? Why can't you see me? And yet, even though I was there, I felt completely invisible. And what made me feel even worse was that the person whom I felt invisible toward wasn't some guy or some guy's girlfriend or even Mr. Hefner himself. It was my mother. Here's how the situation went down: I got a sweet email from Cute Guy Friend on the anniversary of my dad's death last week. He wrote to say that he was thinking of my family and remembering my dad. How sweet is that? Well, as my awkward (and awful...) luck would have it, things turned pretty sour, pretty quickly when I casually brought it up to my mother later that day. "Oh, that's sweet," she replied, and then immediately turned to my sister and said, "You should date him..." My sister? Really? I mean...really? I just sat there floored, and quite a bit deflated. A few minutes later, during which time my mother had probably forgotten what she'd said in the first place, I said flat-out, "Why didn't you say that to me?" "You've never expressed an interest in him," she replied, as if my question was the dumbest thing she'd ever heard. NEWSFLASH: Neither has my sister. She's never expressed an interest in him. Not even once. So let's review the facts, shall we, friends? -He emailed me -My sister hardly knows him I suppose it bothered me even more because this isn't the first time my mother has bypassed me completely, which is why I've always looked at my sister as the pretty one. I know, it's being overly sensitive probably on my part, and my mother probably wasn't even thinking about my disability when she made that remark. In the last few months, I've been feeling increasingly confident as a sexy woman with a disability ( OK, gosh, just typing the word sexy to describe myself just made me blush, literally... ), and I suppose this harmless comment brought some of those invisibility, wallflower feelings back. Even if just a little bit, you know? Is it impossible for my mother - or anyone, really - to think that I could be capable of being in a relationship? Has that concept just never even dawned on her? Am I not worthy of that just as much as anyone else? I know she doesn't do it consciously, but sometimes, I swear my mother is incapable of seeing me as a woman, and yes, I'm aware that this is a common theme among mothers. But it just seems so much more pronounced in my life, especially when you add the disability factor to it. Or maybe, at the end of the day, I'm just being overly sensitive. Maybe I'm projecting my own insecurities and using them as a lens by which to judge things. Let's be honest, friends: It's not like I haven't done that sort of thing before. But you know what, damnit? It bothered me. It hurt me. It eroded just a little of the disability self-esteem that had been slowly growing like a flower. Well, now the flower looks as if it's beginning to wilt. What do you think, friends? Am I just being overly neurotic once again? xoxo [Photos via happythings ] Routines...my gosh, they can be hard to get back into, can't they, friends? I'm back at work today and am trying to get back into the swing of things. May these calming photos inspire me - and you! xoxo [Photos via flickr ] Happy Monday, friends! I was going over the Man Candy archives over the weekend, and I had to gasp when I realized I haven't featured this guy yet. Well, he's more of a man than a guy, and let's just say that he's only gotten better with age. He showed us a new life of living on a prayer and always promised to lay us down in a bed of roses. And as she's aged, he's up the sexy-wow factor by declaring "it's my life" and reminding us that, yes, we can go home again... JON BON JOVI!!!!!!!!!! Happy Friday, friends! How was your week? My spring break was entirely too short (as always!), but I'm looking forward to returning to work on Monday and get back into some semblance of a routine.

Longtime FSP readers know that I am interested in how academia is depicted in literature and other artistic venues, and that I have a particular interest in academic satire in novels . Although I generally disapprove of attempts to make academia and academics seem like bizarre, megalomaniacal control freaks who are entirely disconnected from the "real" world, I am not incapable of enjoying a good academic satire (hence my fondness of the novel Straight Man , by Richard Russo). I even like the Indigo Girls' song, "Closer to Fine", despite this horrific set of anti-academic lyrics: I went to see the doctor of philosophy With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee. He never did marry, or see a B-grade movie He graded my performance He said he could see through me. I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my paper And I was free. Give me a break. Anyway, I was curious to read the recent novel "36 Arguments for the Existence of God" ( Rebecca Goldstein ), described in some reviews as a brilliant new example in the academic satire genre. Washington Post (Ron Charles): The field of academic satire is crowded with such classics as "Lucky Jim" and "Straight Man," but "36 Arguments" sports so many spot-on episodes of cerebral pomposity that you've got to place this novel among the very funniest ever written. New York Times (Janet Maslin ): When Cass witnesses a PowerPoint presentation featuring “brain scans of sophomores, neuroimaged in the throes of moral deliberation over whether they should, in theory, toss a hapless fat man onto the tracks in order to use his bulk to save five other men from an oncoming trolley,” this book occupies its ideal vantage point: close to the absurdity of current academic thinking yet just far enough away to laugh. Cerebral pomposity? The absurdity of current academic thinking? Did these reviewers also spend their college years prostrate to bearded, Rasputin-loving higher minds? Certainly there are pompous intellectuals in academia, and some research topics and methods seem quite absurd , but these are not the kinds of things I enjoy seeing parodied in novels and pilloried in reviews. For me, the most clever and entertaining academic novels are the ones that show the absurdity of the weird-but- mundane rituals of academic life (professor-student interactions, faculty meetings, budgets, tenure) and that are a bit more subtle in their portrayal of classic personalities in academe. Therefore, I am not particularly impressed by bizarre and disturbing characters such as the "Extreme Distinguished Professor" in 36 Arguments , and am much more entertained by a depiction of strangely recognizable people embroiled in the bizarre and disturbing rituals of a faculty search (as in Straight Man ). Said FSP's daughter's middle school Science teacher to FSP when he saw her in the corridor of the school: Hey, it's the famous woman scientist. I was taken aback at first, wondering why he used adjectives, one of which was strange and the other implied that scientist = man unless you specify otherwise (hence the somewhat cynical name for this blog). But then I figured out why he greeted me that way. Later, this same science teacher asked me if I would come talk to his class in a month or two. Great! I replied. But I thought you were done with the unit on My Science. Oh.. ah.. yes. Actually, we are doing a unit on Diversity and so we need a .. a .. a.. Woman scientist? Yes, exactly. The state expects us to do something on Diversity and I uh.. uh.. have no clue what to do and don't even know enough to ask this favor in a non-offensive way? I didn't say that, but, actually, I don't have a clue either. I have never talked about Diversity to a group of middle school kids before. I assume that I should talk about all types of diversity, not gender. I would like to keep my overall message positive and talk about Science as a rewarding career, but perhaps we could also discuss stereotypes of scientists (strange white males). I'm going to have to give this a lot more thought. Has anyone else given a talk on Diversity to middle schoolers? I could use some advice. As both a student and a professor, I have experienced at various times both the US quarter and semester systems. For those unfamiliar with these systems: An academic year composed of quarters involves 3 academic terms (+ a summer term = 4 quarters), each of 10 weeks duration (fall, winter, spring). An academic year composed of semesters involves 2 terms, each ~15 (±) weeks duration (fall and "spring", the former of which may include the end of summer and the latter of which includes the winter season). Some of my colleagues and students experience the "block plan" (1 intensive course per 3 week period), but I have not, so I will confine my comments to quarters v. semesters. Both quarter and semester systems have advantages and disadvantages for professors and students, but these pros and cons may shift around from course to course depending on various factors related to course content and professorial teaching ability. Quarter system: Terms are shorter. Boring classes are over sooner, and boring professors can inflict less damage. The content and format of some courses, even very enthralling ones, are better suited to a shorter term. Quarters typically start later (September in the US) and end later (June) than the semester-based academic year. You may like or dislike quarters owing to this feature; alternatively, you may like this feature in late August and early September (when your semester colleagues have started their academic year) and hate it in May and early June (when your semester colleagues already have their grades done). It may be easier for professor to get a research leave for a quarter than it is to get a semester leave. Students on the quarter system may be at a disadvantage in the summer because their academic year ends late relative to the start of some summer internships and other jobs. Semester system : Semesters can seem very, very long. Your joy at making it to Spring Break may be a bit dampened by the realization that the semester is only half over. You can, however, explore more topics in more depth than you can with a shorter term. You may have more flexibility in course content, owing to the longer term. You get to know your students better. You might even learn all their names. You may start the academic year before you are ready for summer to end, but you are done in the spring. Depending on your institutions policies re. teaching load, you may have fewer course preps/year. You only have to deal with beginning and end of semester craziness twice instead of 3 times. In an academic term, the first couple of weeks and the last week or two can be quite chaotic, but in a semester, there is plenty of time in the middle to get into a routine in which the logistics of the course are at least functioning well. As a student, I didn't have a strong preference, even once I had experienced both systems. Depending on how many courses I was expected to take at once and what the course offerings were, I may have had a slight preference for one over the other, but overall it didn't matter a lot to me. As a professor, I think I prefer the quarter system, recognizing that semesters do have some distinct advantages. For most courses, I feel that I can convey the most essential information in 10 weeks. I wouldn't like quarters if I had to create new courses all the time, but for a relatively stable set of courses and only the occasional new course to prepare, quarters are better for maintaining a high energy level and morale from term start to term end. Which do you like? Semesters or quarters or something else? Some applications for open faculty positions require letters of recommendation up-front; some request letters only after there has been a first stage of selection based on other information supplied by the applicant. Although I don't mind the first method, I prefer the second because it seems like a better use of time for those writing the letters and for those reading the applications. I know that things are done in a different way at many non-US institutions, but lately I have encountered variations on this system within the US. In the past few months: - I received a request for a letter of reference for someone who had already been invited to interview at a US institution. In fact, no letters of reference were solicited until this stage, so my letter wasn't supplementary or an attempt to fill a reference letter quota. The letters were clearly not a part of the interview selection decision. It is unclear what role, if any, they have in the search. and - I received a request for a letter of reference after someone had a phone interview but before they were invited for the actual interview . I am glad I am not on that hiring committee, as it seems to involve several extra steps. I didn't mind either of those requests, although the first case made me wonder why the institution even bothered to get letters if they are so unimportant in the process. Perhaps it is an administrative requirement? Having read thousands of these letters, I must say I can't really blame anyone for not valuing reference letters very much. A letter request that did annoy me, however, was one accompanied by the information that my letter would not even be read unless the candidate advanced to the final interview stage. In this case, the position is not an academic one, so perhaps I just lack familiarity with how things are done outside academia. From what I could tell from the instructions, the organization will not read the letters before the final candidates are selected from a huge pool of applicants but wants to have the letters on hand to read as soon as the final interviewees are selected, and hence the request for possibly superfluous letters. I can understand the wish for efficiency, especially given the large number of applicants, but it is a bit of a strange request: Please write this letter even though we are unlikely to read it. We need to be efficient but we are willing to (possibly) waste your time. Wouldn't such a request lend itself to getting cursory letters or letters that are not focused specifically on the position for which the applicant has applied? I typically take some time to customize each letter depending on what the position is, and in some cases this takes quite a bit of time. Why would I do that if I don't know if my letter will even be read? I guess I will do it for the same reason we write any reference letters, not knowing if the subject of the letters will get the position. Despite knowing in this particular case that my letter may be transferred, unread, directly to an electronic trash heap, I think the best strategy is to try to forget about that and write the letter in the hopes that it will eventually be read, the student will get the job, and it will all be worthwhile in the end. A reader asks: How long do you typically give 1st or 2nd year grad students to "pull things together" when they struggle in the beginning? Where is the line is drawn and what factors affect the judgments professors will make about their students? I will consider only PhD students in this discussion. I should say right away that I do not have a foolproof way of deciding when or where to draw the line on struggling students. I tend to err on the side of delusional optimism, hoping that some solution involving change in project (topics, methods), degree of supervision (more structure, specific goal-setting), or approach to writing will pull us all through the problems. Only in hindsight has it been obvious when this was a bad plan, resulting in prolonged suffering and expense. In other cases, it has worked; by "worked" I mean that the student got their PhD and therefore any difficulties were worth it, I think. That said, when and where I draw the line depends on the specific things with which the student is struggling and how (or whether) they are making an effort to communicate about and/or deal with the problem(s). Is the problem motivation? If a student is unproductive owing to a severe lack of interest or motivation in any reasonable research project they can do with me as adviser, that is something that should be quite clear in the second year, if not the first. (though I have had students who started out very energetic in the first year but whose motivation was completely extinguished in the second by the reality of what research and/or working with me involves) Is the problem that the student lacks the information or skills necessary to do the research? That can be fixed in many cases, and should be dealt with by the end of the second year. The student should be as proactive as possible about learning what they need to know to do their research. Is the problem the adviser? Is this something that could be fixed by discussing the situation or is it something that can't be changed? If the latter, the student has a decision to make about whether to continue with that adviser. Although it is possible that, with time, the student may understand better what seems like irrational or unkind behavior, it is likely that the adviser won't become more sane or nice with time. Is the problem beyond the student's control? Examples: Access to facilities? A complex and difficult research project that may proceed in a non-linear way? Lack of clear direction? Research that takes a long time to produce interpretable results? I am impressed by students who find ways to deal with obstacles like these. In fact, a student who feels like they are struggling, perhaps because they are too critical when comparing themselves with others, may not be struggling in the eyes of the adviser and other faculty. Other problems, such as those involving finishing a project or writing, may not manifest themselves until later (after the first two years). In the first two years, it is not too late to change course in a possibly dramatic way, including deciding that there is no point in continuing in the graduate program. There have been a few cases in which I decided in the first or second year that there was no point in advising a student for a PhD; these students got an MS instead. There has to be an obvious, major reason for going this route, though -- e.g., failed classes or lack of productivity owing to extreme lack of effort. Will a student who has a slow (but not catastrophic) first year or two be at a permanent disadvantage? I suppose this depends on the adviser, but in my opinion, a student who struggles with something in the first year or two, but who eventually surmounts the obstacles and succeeds, should not be at a disadvantage later. In fact, few arrive in graduate school perfectly prepared to leap into the perfect project that goes perfectly from Day One. If you had asked any of my graduate advisers or committee members what they thought of me in my first or second years of graduate school, the responses would have ranged from a derisive snort to a polite but sympathetic chuckle at my likely future career as a cat sitter. That changed a few years later once I started getting results and writing papers, and my slow start didn't harm my career. If you (mostly) like what you are doing, and at times possibly even love what you are doing, and you want to keep going with your research, despite initial problems, my advice, summarized, is: Stay focused, know what your goals are (short-range, intermediate-range, long-range), communicate with your adviser and others, if you feel stuck at least make some progress step-by-step (even if the steps seem small), and don't worry so much. The Chronicle Review (the magazine-like part of The Chronicle of Higher Education ) recently asked a group of "scholars and experts" to comment on stress in the lives of academics, using the Amy Bishop incident as a springboard for the discussion; i.e., what role might stress related to the tenure process have played in this tragedy? The scholars and experts included: a writer and PhD candidate in English literature the chancellor of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education a professor of international politics a professor of English an assistant professor of public policy and political science an assistant professor of socio
ogy and women's and gender studies a PhD candidate in anthropology a dean of a School of Arts &amp; Sciences a professor of management a professor of history Clearly there was an effort to consult a wide variety of academics associated with the US system of higher education: professors and administrators, tenured professors and tenure-track professors, professors at universities and professors at small liberal arts colleges, even some PhD candidates who have no direct experience (yet) with the stresses of being on the tenure-track. Many of these people had thoughtful insights; I was interested to know the opinions of sociologists and anthropologists and others. Even so, Amy Bishop was an assistant professor of biology. Does it seem odd to anyone else that there were no biology or other science professors in this particular group of academics commenting on the incident? I looked up the chancellor and the dean and learned that their field of expertise is psychology, so perhaps they come the closest, but that's not the same as getting the opinion of someone who has recently experienced the tenure process as a scientist. I realize that a biology professor would not necessarily have any more insight into the general implications of the incident than those who provided comments in this piece in the Chronicle . And I still stand by my overall view (shared by the PhD candidate in English literature) that the murders were the actions of an imbalanced person with a rage problem (and a gun), and the tragedy was therefore not a direct result of the stresses of academia in general or the tenure evaluation system in particular. Still, I think it is strange that in an otherwise diverse group, not one is a science professor with direct knowledge of what it is like to get tenure as a scientist today at a university. Consider how bizarre it would have been if an English professor (for example) had committed a heinous crime that may or may not have been related to the experience of being an English professor, and the only people asked to comment (in a particular series of essays) were science, engineering, and math professors. I also think it would have been illuminating to read, for comparison, the thoughts of a scientist recently denied tenure. With all due respect to the PhD candidates and literary scholars who wrote thoughtful essays for the piece, surely the Chronicle could have found some current or former science professors -- ideally in the life sciences -- to comment? I don't want to perpetuate an "us" (scientists) vs. "them (non-scientists) mentality, but often when I read about academia, in the Chronicle and elsewhere, the point of view of non-scientists is the only one represented. This gives a very incomplete view of academia and the lives of academics, in general and in extreme cases. Although we have much in common as researchers and educators, there are also significant differences that, at times, merit consideration. Who is staying away from campus for Spring Break by choice (i.e., not owing to a furlough)? Who is doing this because otherwise they will have a dire childcare challenge? Who is staying away from campus for a week as a sanity break so that they can face the rest of the academic year with renewed energy? Of those avoiding campus: Will you be going somewhere (preferably fun and interesting) or just staying home (and possibly working there)? Who will be on campus but would rather not be there? Who will be on campus because if they don't, they fear the consequences (from their adviser, from their advisees , from a promotion &amp; tenure committee, from collaborators)? If you are a graduate student, has your adviser specifically discussed with you whether you can/should/will work over Spring Break? If so, what did they say? If not, what do you think they would say? And who is going to be on campus because they want to be there -- to enjoy a week of relative quiet in their office, catch up on research, get ready for post-break classes, and possibly even clean their desk and its immediate surroundings?

We sit in my office and we/I try to find something of mutual interest that we can discuss. I am not a skilled conversationalist, but I can almost always find something to talk about for half an hour. One of the things I am not tempted to discuss is the disparity in success or fame or IQ or amount of funding of whatever between the visitor and me. What would be the point of that? It is therefore disconcerting for me when I find myself in the visitor's chair in someone else's office and they start the conversation with a series of self-deprecating statements about how they have not published as much as I have, and how I write better proposals than they do, and how they are basically not as successful as I am. This does not happen often, but it happens from time to time. I hasten to note that this is not because I am so awesomely famous or well funded. My usual description of myself is "reasonably successful" as a scientist, and I think that is accurate. I do not think the self-deprecation is a form of false modesty. The self-deprecating person is genuinely ripped up about their lack of productivity. I think these conversations stem more from insecurities than from anything specific about me or my career. Even so, what I am supposed to say when confronted with these types of statements? I am more than willing to have a conversation about proposal strategies or ideas for new directions in research, or even to have a group wallow about some aspect of Science or Academia that is particularly controversial or nerve-wracking. If the self-deprecating person is a stressed out early career professor, I can go into mentor mode, if that seems to be a useful way to go. Otherwise, I try to steer the conversations to research-related topics that might be of mutual interest, or I ask a lot of questions. It is possible that some "successful" visitors will want to tell you how amazing they (think they) are, but in the absence of such a conversational foray, here is a gentle request to those scheduled for an individual meeting with a visiting speaker: Even if you feel that you are orders of magnitude less successful than your visitor in some professional capacity, even if you have the most raging case of impostor syndrome, even if you are in awe of the towering intellect of your distinguished visitor, and even if you can think of nothing more fabulous than being a short, unprepossessing middle-aged female science professor like your visitor, please tuck away these feelings and talk about Science or Students or Something else other than your (relative) lack of success. Some visitor's egos may need continual care and stoking, but I think you will feel better, and everyone will have a more interesting half hour, if self-deprecation, whatever the reason for it, is not a major feature of the conversation.

Ivor Reveley (check out the “Gotta Run” t-shirt) On whether he has done such a thing before… Two years ago, on his fiftieth birthday, Ivor and a team of runners ran from Romford to Orpington.&#160; They ran 50kms over 50 hours to raise money for 50 young people with autism.&#160; Ivor broke that down for me and explained that it is not as impossible as it sounds (bearing in mind that I walk a 5km fun run once a year): you run for two to three hours a day over three days and cover about 20 kilometres a day.&#160; It is not easy but it is possible! They raised £8,500 on that occasion which meant that their charity CASPA was able to obtain viability and get the real start that it required.&#160; This is so important, as Ivor explains, because it meant that the charity could remain a stable entity in the lives of the children and families it serves. On why he was raising money for CASPA? Ivor's sixteen-year-old son has autism.&#160; After being a charity trustee for fifteen to twenty years, Ivor realised that he had the skill necessary to make a difference in the lives of other children with autism and he decided to get involved with CASPA. On what CASPA is and what they do... Ivor is the chair and trustee of the charity.&#160; They started off as an informal parents’ association in 2002 and formally registered the charity in 2005.&#160; As a charity, they run events and workshops for young people with autism such as: Brighton Beach kid’s days out Youth Club on a Friday night A residential week long summer camp Independent Living Workshops (which are sponsored by the LDA ) They have received brilliant feedback from the children who say it is a safe environment for them to have fun, free from bullying or other such concerns. On making the runs interesting… After completing A-levels in Economics, Geography and Maths, Ivor went on to study Economics at university. An avid map lover, Ivor is now using his Geography and Maths skills again as he plans the most historical and geographically interesting routes through cathedrals and up high streets.&#160; The idea is for the runners to enjoy these events and to see and learn about the places they run through. On this year’s event… Date: 30 April – 3 May 2010. Route: Clapham Common to Brighton Beach ( route details ) Ivor hopes to do events like this every even year and this year they will be doing a four day run from Clapham to Brighton.&#160; Ivor is keeping a log of all of the training and organising of the event in his blog Four Days Running . A half marathon is 21km and these runners will be doing more than that each day as they will run from about 2.30pm to 5pm every day for four days. Friends, family and supporters will be able to meet up with the runners every evening as pub nights are being organised on Facebook and the hotels that the group is staying in is published on the site ( stay on route ). This is not a public run but anyone interested in joining the run can contact Ivor at the site to get involved.&#160; They have a photographer taking part this year so expect great photos! On how YOU can help… You can donate money using the button above.&#160; That will take you to the Just Giving site where the money will go straight to the charity and won’t touch anyone’s hands. But don’t worry, there are lots of other ways to help too: Follow the Four Days Running blog Follow Ivor’s Twitter account: @revivor .&#160; Join the fun and do the four day run: Run With Us Stay on the route and be a supporter If you are reading this anywhere besides Emm in London or in an RSS reader then the content is stolen.

Barely a day goes by when we don’t hear of someone’s tales of woe with regards to their finances. Maybe nary a day goes by when you don’t think of your OWN tales of personal finance horror, but this post isn’t about personal finances, in fact, this post isn’t even going to be particularly serious in the slightest, perhaps a welcome break from the drudgery we encounter on a day-to-day basis. This post is for those who dare to dream, who occasionally – or often, there’s no discrimination at play here – have flights of fancy where they can afford whatever they please, consequences be damned. Food. Everyone loves food. Of course, there are picky eaters, gluttons who eat anything and then there’s the gourmet, who will indulge in only the finest of fripperies wherever food is concerned. You’ve probably guessed where this is going and it’s headed in a direction in which the subject matter will revolve around the finest/most expensive eating establishments in Britain, avoiding the cliché that is the “world’s most expensive” and instead opting for the lower-key “just in Britain” subtitle, so maybe you’ll want to bear these in mind next time you’re booking any flights to London . There are no diamonds in food, gemstones on cutlery-related shenanigans here, for these places are expensive because…well…they just ARE. London, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay Also one of the single most expensive restaurants in the world, this place can set you back at least £120 for a single person and that’s just selecting from the average stuff. If you were to opt for more exquisite dishes and then a bottle or wine or so, well, then you’re looking at a hefty price-tag indeed! A favorite amongst locals and tourists alike (provided that can afford it, of course), the restaurant itself is known for serving up the most palate-pleasing dishes in the whole of England’s fine capital city. Typical delights on offer might include Cornish lamb, pork belly and the finest Angus beef, all mixed in with a wide range of other fine accoutrements. By the time you were done with this place, you’d certainly be in a better position to understand the reason behind the three Michelin Stars that have been awarded to it. However, your wallet might not be! Berkshire, Waterside Inn Put on the proverbial map thanks to fantastic food, a three-star Michelin chef in the form of owner Michel Roux and a £24 plum soufflé that made it onto the Forbes list of the world’s most expensive desserts (it came tenth), the Waterside Inn is not only a dive into opulence, but also a dive into quality as those stars aren’t awards to just anyone that comes along. With “Inn” in the title, you’d be correct in suspecting that the building housing the restaurant also serves as a place where you can – for a modest sum – spend a few nights. The restaurant’s chefs serve the whole gamut of dishes you’d expect: lobster, rabbit, lamb, duck, turbot and many others, each served as decadently and in an adept a fashion as you’d imagine. Truly an experience for the rich in taste as well as the rich in wealth, as you will most likely be set back around £100+ for a two-course meal. London, Sketch Back to the nation’s capital again, for meals that again breach the £100 mark. Sketch has long been touted as an incredibly expensive place to eat, hence the gaggle of celebrities and other people of note that occasionally dine at the establishment. However, the price doesn’t belie the quality and instead is more of an indication of it, what with the restaurant itself being a product of Algerian restaurateur Mourad Mazouz and celebrated French chef Pierre Gagnaire, you can rest assured that the place will contain nothing less than the most sumptuous of everything the culinary realm has to offer.

Please report stolen content to missus.emm@gmail.com Copyright 2008-2009 Missus Emm http://missus-emm.blogspot.com 3mm154m2ndy On Tuesday night, we went to see the Garrick Theatre production of Douglas Carter Beane’s The Little Dog Laughed. The Little Dog Laughed is about a rising Hollywood star Mitchell (Rupert Friend) who in the words of his agent “suffers from a slight recurring case of homosexuality”.&#160; He meets rent boy Alex (Harry Lloyd) and their lives are turned somewhat upside down when they both fall for each other despite both asserting that they are not gay.&#160; The play is set against the backdrop of Hollywood and homosexuality and explores all of the double standards and difficulties with coming out in show business.&#160; There is a fantastic quote by Colin Firth in the programme which just about sums it up: “If you’re a straight actor who takes on the role of a gay man, it’s obviously not the same as being one in this business”. The Little Dog Laughed was written by Douglas Carter Beane who also wrote To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar , a 1995 film starring Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snapes.&#160; It first opened off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre in 2006.&#160; The play is narrated by Mitchell’s morally challenged agent Diane (played by Tamsin Greig) who has such classic lines as &quot;A writer with the final cut? I'd rather give firearms to small children”.&#160; It is no secret really that I am a massive fan of Harry Lloyd and have spent the past three years watching each and every one of his plays but it is Greig who absolutely steals the show and her acting, wardrobe and personality all fit the role perfectly.&#160; In her role as Diane, Greig superbly breaks through the fourth wall, allowing the audience into the world of Hollywood agents, actors and writers and she did it very well indeed.&#160; She was incredibly comfortable chatting and winking to the audience one minute and then diving right back into her encounters with the rest of the cast the next. Rupert Friend plays the drunken, privileged and somewhat sheltered Mitchell really well.&#160; While I tend not to question how characters were written (as it is generally a fixed factor when putting on a play), I have to wonder at a rising Hollywood star who doesn’t get the significance of coming out to the world and the effect that could have on his career.&#160; In the end, his naiveté is what trips him up though. In an equal sense, Harry Lloyd’s Alex just doesn’t seem to understand the dynamic of his relationship with his girl pal Ellen (played by Gemma Arterton) and the effect that his growing relationship with Mitchell will have on her.&#160; He does, however, utter my favourite line of the play while trying to get a point across to Mitchell: “God, talking to you is like sewing a button on cottage cheese”. As far as rather shallow, clueless roles go, Friend and Lloyd do as well as they can do but they have both taken on much better roles in the past.&#160; The one thing they do both handle extremely well is the intimacy and affection that develops between their two characters.&#160; There is a fair bit of nudity in the play (with Harry Lloyd being fully nude at one point) and both actors were professional and convincing in their roles. Gemma Arterton was far less convincing and you got the idea that she was trying to inflate her supporting role somewhat as the character definitely shrinks in comparison to the other three.&#160; She seemed to posture a lot and to shout her lines rather than speak them with meaning and emotion.&#160; She is quite inexperienced in theatre though and this certainly didn’t ruin the play.&#160; You have to wonder though if those in casting didn’t foresee that she would be completely overshadowed by Greig (or perhaps that was the point?) This production of The Little Dog Laughed was directed by Jamie Lloyd and I must say he made good use of the space and actors.&#160; There is one invisible character, so to speak, who appears in one scene and speaks on the phone but is not played by anyone.&#160; I thought this was really well portrayed by the cast and well managed by the director. The set was designed by Soutra Gilmour who received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Set Design in 2009.&#160; While Gilmour’s sets are often dark and almost sinister, this was stark, bare and completely white but the minimalist set worked in this play.&#160; The play itself is incredibly funny and highly entertaining.&#160; It doesn’t provide any grand answers to the problems it identifies but seems to focus more on the situation at hand and how that plays out.&#160; The audience was laughing along raucously at the numerous one-liners and there was much enthusiastic clapping and cheers of “bravo!” at the end.&#160; All in all it was a fun night out and I’d certainly recommend the play for people seeking a light-hearted comedy experience. The Little Dog Laughed is playing at the Garrick Theatre until 10 April 2010.&#160; There are really good prices available on tickets at LastMinute.com and we got tickets for £29.50 each from WestEndTheatre.com .

The Drums The Drums are a post-punk band hailing from Brooklyn, New York and it is likely that you would recognise their song “Let’s Go Surfing”.&#160; They are currently on a sold out tour of UK, Ireland and mainland Europe and will be supporting Florence and the Machine on their nationwide tour starting in May. The Drums have a sound reminiscent of the punk and ska bands of the early eighties but I found them to be pretty average and unoriginal. I had not even heard of them before the night but certainly won’t be rushing off to buy any of their albums.&#160; Most importantly, I have never seen a bunch of people look so uncomfortable on a stage before.&#160; I’ve seen cheesy robotic dancing before and singers playing air drums but it is clear that The Drums have a long way to go as a band before they make that look cool. &#160; The Big Pink The Big Pink are the reason we went to the Shockwaves NME Awards Tour this year and it is safe to say that I am a massive fan of their album A Brief History of Love which I reviewed on BlogCritics 
n January.&#160; The Big Pink arrived on stage with lights and explosions and their whole set was energetic, frenetic and loud.&#160; Their songs were much heavier than they had sounded on their CD and it was a manic mash up of squealing guitars and noise. I imagine that this signals a heavier direction for their new album but it could also be overcompensation for the fact that most of their music is pre-recorded and sampled.&#160; That meant that vocalist Robbie Furze was screaming his vocals and grinding his guitar while we debated amongst ourselves whether the bassist and drummer weren’t in fact miming.&#160; I am always happy for indie alternative bands to take on a heavier, louder sound; in fact, the noisier the better as far as I am concerned.&#160; But this was not a great performance.&#160; I’ve seen many bands that use heavy sampling including The Prodigy, Dan le Sac vs Scroobius Pip and Faithless and it is so difficult to put on a great show in front of a massive audience when the majority of your band members are doing little on the actual night but miming.&#160; The Big Pink didn’t really get it right on Saturday night. Bombay Bicycle Club Bombay Bicycle Club hail from north London and took their name from a string of curry restaurants in the area.&#160; I have no idea what I expected from them before I heard them play on Saturday night as I had barely even heard of them but wasn’t in the least bit interested in listening to any of their music. I certainly didn’t expect to have them rock my socks off.&#160; Seconds into their first song, I found myself debating whether to rush off to the shops the next day or order their album through Amazon.&#160; Thankfully, such debates were soon put out of my mind as I got caught up in their energetic, enthusiastic set.&#160; The one thing they did prove was that the problems with the previous two acts weren’t down to bad acoustics in the venue because their whole sound and lights show was fabulous.&#160; Jack Steadman has a fantastically unique voice and the band are confident and exciting on stage.&#160; Oh, and they can dance.&#160; Perhaps the guys from The Drum need to take some dancing lessons from them.&#160; The crowd went mad for them and I would have to say that Bombay Bicycle Club were the best band of the night.&#160; It is not often that I am won over to unknown bands during a live performance but they were that good. The Maccabees The Maccabees played a massive fifteen song set on Saturday night and gave one of the most impressive live performances I have seen in years.&#160; The Maccabees are from south London but are currently based in London.&#160; They have five full time members but their incredible show included three musicians on brass instruments and at one stage Edwyn Collins joined them to sing “Rip It Up”.&#160; The Maccabees use the whole stage and everything from their backdrop to their set up and lighting is absolutely professional and first class.&#160; I honestly found myself widening my eyes to try drink everything in.&#160; Like with Bombay Bicycle Club, the sound was perfect and the crowd went absolutely mad for The Maccabees.&#160; They didn’t quite have the impact on me that Bombay Bicycle Club did but that is not to say that they weren’t brilliant.&#160; They were really good and I’d definitely go see them again sometime. After a rocky start, the ShockWaves NME Awards Tour 2010 was a huge success and Bombay Bicycle Club and The Maccabees certainly made up for a slightly shaky start.&#160; The best thing about the O2 Brixton Academy of course is that after the show, we were able to nip into Nandos for some chicken burgers thus avoiding the British tradition of the post-night out dodgy vindaloo.

I started digging my wallet for the extra quarter and he seemed to sense that I wanted a bag for my lonely little OJ, and I told him that no! I didn't need one. I fished out the quarter and laid it on the counter as he handed me the OJ and smiled warmly.As I walked away, I felt filled with an unexpected joy and contentment. In that moment, I felt the city wrap around me for the first time in a while, protectively cuddling me from all sides. I looked around and saw the New York I had first seen in 2004: that energy, that life, that art pulsing through everything. No matter how many chain coffee houses there are, or how much money gets poured into meaningless capitalistic pursuits in this city, there will always be that feeling of endless possibility, that freedom, like if you just believe in it and want it bad enough, you can literally be anything you want. That feeling, that uniquely New York feeling, is something that everyone who ever came to New York to pursue a dream has experienced and can speak to, whether it was in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, or beyond; and as I walked the block to my office from the coffee cart - which, by the way, was set up right across the street from a Starbucks - I felt it pressing on me in the most comforting way.Despite everything I've been through, and all the uncertainty that continues to face me, I heard the city telling me it's going to be OK, and I believed it. I put my hands in the pockets of my trench coat, smiled to myself and walked on.
We are so pleased to announce that our new website is up and running. We are officially moving all of our blog activity to our new www.urbansprouts.org site. Please check it out and bookmark our new page. I recently learned from my students that oxalis, an invasive and aggressive weed for many San Francisco gardeners, is also called sourgrass, whose flower stalk can actually be chewed. Although oxalis has another beneficial function, that is, to prevent soil erosion on slopes, I can't help but feel that every time I'm up at one of my schools, it's a renewed battle between oxalis and gardener. Last week, I issued a challenge to my students at Ida B. Wells to pull out as much oxalis as they could from our two main beds, which would be documented as before and after pictures on this blog. Although some students went right to work, others required much more coaxing; many students seem to have an inherent dislike of weeding, even if it's just the patch in front of them. At the end of class and after three huge piles of oxalis, it still looked like we barely made a dent in the ratio of oxalis to vegetables. Note to self - next time, to prevent oxalis takeovers, try mulching early before the rains start. Before weeding around the fava beans... After weeding (one student's work)... Mulching with straw with my afterschool class... I am very excited to bring to you a glimpse of a day in our gardens. Thanks to our new Flip cameras, you can see Urban Sprouts in action preparing freshly harvested collards into delicious, simple, gourmet snacks! Students at both Martin Luther King middle school and International Studies Academy have gotten excited about sharing their perspective of the garden to the community and each other. In the near future I hope to use the Flip camera as a medium of communication between the two schools. At Urban Sprouts, we want to connect students to local produce, whether it's food from the school garden, persimmons and lemons from someone's backyard, or fresh finds from the farmer's market. At Aptos Middle School, the lettuce, arugula, and radish from our school garden were ready to be harvested and tossed into a salad. Students washed, chopped, and combined local fruits and vegetables with a sesame salad dressing and a persimmon vinagrette. Although some students were more interested in the cooking than in the eating, it was a first step towards creating healthy (and colorful) dishes using many local ingredients. Additionally, students at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School learned how to whip up persimmon ice cream using only five ingredients (lemon, vanilla, sugar, buttermilk, and persimmons), and without a fancy ice cream maker. Thank you, Ms. Bressack, for donating the delicious persimmons from your backyard! Help grow the school gardens movement! We are looking for members to join our Outreach Committee. These individuals will work alongside our staff to represent Urban Sprouts at partner school events, community fairs, farmers markets, and other city-wide events.

Pictures from Log Cabin Ranch Last week was a busy week in the gardens as we hosted 3 large group events. Employees and students from Wells Fargo, Haas School of Business, and Blueprint Research &amp; Design performed almost 100 hours of volunteer labor as we built worm bins and compost bins, dug new beds, and completed some general garden work. This was a fantastic start to our new composting initiative as we are on track to build new compost bins, worm bins, and compost sifters in all 7 of our sites in the next few months. 0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false /- Style Definitions -/ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} Thank you so much for your time and energy, it's always so great to welcome new folks into the gardens.

thrift shirt and skirt. gap sweatshirt. Pictures I took back when my hair was blonde and there was snow outside and I wasn't all lazy and in a style rut like now. Any ideas as to what a story to them could be? I haven't the slightest idea. Today in school we played dodgeball. Or, rather, I played dodgeball, and everyone else played kickball. But then they were all "NOO COME ON YOU CAN'T BE THAT BAD" and I was like "HAHAH THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK" and then they made me kick it and I ran to the wrong base. Actually, I didn't even run to a base, I just ran to this random mat that I thought was a base, but was just IN THE WAY, and POINTLESS, kind of like the interpretive dancing at the Oscars. But you know what would've made this experiment far less painful? IF I HAD BEEN WEARING THIS: Along with paying a visit to the 60's (my favorite era, which is probably some kind of twist of FATE) (see what I did there? Bob Dylan song? 60's?) (Oh wait, that song is actually 70's. I...fail. Anyway.) Miu Miu was almost cartoonish with its giant bows, poppy colors, scallops, exaggerated pocket piping, and shoe skirts that added an extra clunky stomping factor to the overall effect. And there were LOTS of embellishments with metallic bows and flowers, kind of as if the wearer was a little girl going through her grandma's jewelry box (from when grand mam mam had her 60's heydey) and sort of decorating herself with brooches. It started out with the bright colors and cartoon-ish lace (which I will now refer to as the little sister of Prada's ) but towards the end got to a place that was darker, a different kind of romantic, slightly stark.. The silhouettes, colors, and fabrics became more sophisticated, and the playful, wiry flower brooches were replaced by some in full bloom. There were parts I didn't care for or that wouldn't have really improved today's game of kickball, (which is now the new standard for everything: would it improve my pitiful, athletically-challenged middle school experiences? WOULD IT?) such as the low cut-overall situations and skirts-over-pants (maybe because I was too reminded of my 3rd grade days when I decided I was really edgy and //alt for wearing a skirt over a pair of jeans. THE MEMORIES, MAKE THEM STOPPPPPP). They didn't feel out of place in the collection but my sentiments for them were those of Enid's here: The spring collection will always be my favorite, and that kind of magic can't happen twice. But over all, it was cute and fun and Miu Miu. And it still would've made that really awful game of kickball much, much better. Prada Fall 2008 / Miu Miu Fall 2010. Hussein Chalayan was based around the idea of a mirage, though that fact was no MIRAGE as the sunglasses said, "MIRAGE". Dad jokes! In all seriousness, because this is serious business, as things always are around here, I first thought it was sort of arbitrary, but the more I looked through it and thought about it the more it made sense, and the fact that it was hard to understand at first only made me like it more. And made it more, of course, like a mirage. I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, MR. CHALAYAN. There were binoculars stuffed up with shearling and leather, hazy nebula-like prints, foggy sheer fabrics, and crocheted jackets that only half-covered the top part of the body. Without the concept, the clothes didn't seem to flow from one look to another too well, but I don't think a Hussein Chalayan collection can be viewed without knowing that there has to be a concept, anyway. The "mirage" sunglasses reminded me of New Year's Eve sunglasses, in a good way. I am not normally one for red carpet dressing (other than the CFDA gala) and last night we didn't even get Tilda or Cate, AND the co-hosting was awkward, AND Twilight is not a horror movie, and Zac Efron STILL HIGHLY RESEMBLES A NEOPET, but Carey Mulligan filled the Prada void that would have been otherwise occupied by Tilda with this dress that looks very pretty and normal at first... But then when you look at a closer picture, you see this, and if you happen to be looking at the closer picture while it's really late and night and you just ate/drank your weight in sugary products, your reaction is 3x the excitement, or, UDISGHDSLUGWHUIWGSD Tiny kitchen utensils! For tiny murderers! Chick is basically wearing a Clue gameboard, AND IT IS FANTASTIC. And Robert Downey Jr. looked awesome. I would like to think that he and Michelle Obama play kickball together in their matching Lanvin sneakers. WELL DONE, SHERLOCK, WELL DONE. That's about it. Again, don't really care for red carpet-type stuff BUT throw some tiny knives and bow ties into the mix and I am intrigued. Oh, and TOM FORD. Throw Tom Ford into the mix and I am also intrigued, and also maybe sitting two inches away from the screen, never mind that it is in the corner of the room hanging from a ceiling. I use my floating powers when necessary, okay? Lastly, I love you all more than rainbows. Vivienne Westwood was like a Maurice Sendak character that runs away to start her own kingdom, AKA, what I would like to do, all the time, a lot. Paper crowns, crayon scribbles (some of which read "Prince Charming") and drapy dresses that could've come out of an older sister's dress-up box..plus, only Vivs could put her models in marker moustaches (time for me to revisit TOMAS , perhaps?) and it still make sense. And, going back to the Maurice Sendak thing: Wild Rumpus crowns, anyone? That star on that grey sweatshirt is TOTALLY Really Rosie? LIFE COMPLETE. At the Independent Fashion Bloggers conference at NYFW, there was a panel including the Fashionista girls, Susie Bubble , Phil Oh , Bryanboy , and myself, and we talked about-WAIT FOR IT- the future of fashion blogging ! Pretty RANDOM topic, if you ask me. There's a video but I'm too afraid to watch it because I probably said some stupid things. But! If I were to paraphrase, I would say we mostly talked about: -Discretion when it comes to accepting gifts or freebies. -Advice to new bloggers. (Which mostly came to: write about what is interesting to you. What works for one blogger doesn't always work for another, and writing about the exact same stuff that a popular blogger writes about will go unnoticed since someone else is already doing the same thing.) -A blogger's place at Fashion Week. -Hey, remember when we all decided we were the greatest people ever and that blogs were the new everything? Me neither! The media likes the story but it ain't no big thang. -We can't predict the future of fashion blogging. The same way no one saw it coming, no one knows where it will go. The big difference between bloggers and journalists isn't the fact that we're using computers. I mean, Cathy Horyn and Lynn Yaeger have blogs, lots of critics write for style.com, and a number of editors, including Hamish Bowles and Andre Leon Talley, write blog posts; but it's not the same as my having a blog - the difference is experience. It's not remarkable that we're using the internet!!! but what most people are pointing out - with me, mostly, since this doesn't apply to the other bloggers that were on the panel - is lack of experience. I haven't gone to journalism school, I haven't had any internships, etc. And I'm 13, which, oh my God, I can't tell you how excited I am to outgrow that number. This, honestly, is what I think is the future of fashion blogging, or at least part of it. The same way teenagers can start a Flickr account and be noticed by a magazine, or a band can start a MySpace and be picked up by a label, blogs will act as jumping-off platforms for people that want to work in the industry. When I started Style Rookie in March of 2008, only ElleGirl and teenvogue.com would write about blogs. It wasn't a big media thing and having one wasn't an affiliation for Fashion Week, it was a nice circle of ladies and occasional dudes who supported each other and often found themselves saying "Thank you for this post! None of my friends get my feelings about ______." Then some of us started taking opportunities that had arisen, and I spent some money on a Hussein Chalayan dress, and then all of a sudden it was like, JUDAAAAAAAAAAS. Which is, you know, bizarre. Allow me to direct you to this epic Dave Eggers essay . So now my inbox and comment section are full of "Can you critique my blog? Can you tell me what to do to get invited to shows? How do I get my blog recognized in the industry?" which isn't a bad thing, I guess (other than the critiquing thing, which like..it's about you and your thoughts. No one is able to tell you what to think or how to explain your thinking to others.) Now blogging is a full-time job for some people and in some cases a segway into the industry but I guess that's the way it goes. And it's sort of a bummer, especially because now I'm far more aware of the number of people that read my blog, and when I take this into consideration when writing a post I feel pressured to sound smarter or fancier when mostly I just enjoy writing journal-like streams of thought (my blog has always been a virtual diary) even though I'm supposed to be writing grand reviews because a newspaper or magazine told whoever to expect that. That's a problem with my own outlook, though, and I still enjoy blogging. A lot. And, thankfully, it doesn't have to be a job for me. When it starts to feel like one, I'll stop. But I don't think anyone is saying blogs are the equivalent to magazines, or inexperienced bloggers like myself are the equivalent to journalists, anyway. Still, there is nothing wrong with having a range of perspectives. I think fashion is important to discuss. Which brings me to this recent Isabel Marant quotation: “For me, fashion shows are not for the public, they are trade shows for the press. It’s time for the press to understand the collection and then spread the information. That’s more interesting than just the image. Everyone wants to be first. It’s too too much. There should be privacy and mystery. There is no excitement about anything anymore as everything is available immediately and all the time – you don’t have to wait for anything. I don’t like the idea of being flooded with image and information. I don’t belong to the generation of spending time on the internet. I think it’s too fast and too fake. It’s like going to a museum on the internet – where is the pleasure? It’s sad because everyone is running after everything, but after what? Everything is too quick. There is no room in your heads for all this information. No one retains anything.” I think that when it comes to fashion shows being online, it's exposure for a brand. I think that a customer deserves to see the show and get to know the world of that label. I like privacy and mystery too, but there's a fine line between that and exclusivity. And-TWIST!-I also hate the fastness of the Internet! And the fakeness! I like buying my magazines and zines and having special stuff I can hold in my hand! And this Internet, it makes the already fast fashion very very fast! And it's scary and a lot of it feels very unauthentic and sad. And fast. But, in five years, the iPhone will be Oldy McOldster from Oldsville, Oldesota. And tumblr then will be like xanga now. Who knows where fashion blogging will be. Point is, things are changing. "Classics with a twist!" Retro futurism! In fashion, all those cliches have been done time and again, but I think that Nicolas Ghesquiere's collection for Balenciaga was the only one as of recent to elevate these concepts to a level that was more refined and thoughtful. "Retro futurism" didn't mean the Jetsons, and "classics" didn't mean camel coats or button-downs. They were elements of home-living and domesticity that were brought into the present with what has now become Nicolas LongName's signature futurism aesthetic. He said his goal was "to ennoble every day objects." Mission accomplished. Ew, that makes me think of Tom Cruise, which makes me think of him jumping on Oprah's couch. And we don't like to talk about that here. So instead I will say, "A+"! But that makes me think of school, and it is the weekend, so we don't like to talk about that here, either. Gosh, is there a reason that there isn't a way to say "GOOD JOB" without being reminded of something terribly disturbing? Well...I guess I could always just say "good job." So, um, good job, Nicky G! (Why do I think this much about these things?) ANYWAY. Futuristic classics! Right! On the far left and far right, updated versions of quilting. The texture on the nude dress reminded me of doilies or lace napkins, and a simple wool sweater was brought into the future with bright green, sort of geometric threading (which really makes me think of that one lily pad game from Zoombinis . In a good way!) The shoes (which were totally killer) were the greatest indication of this - oxfords or loafers or a wood-looking material elevated with geometric shapes and of what looked like minerals (and whose patterns and colors reminded me a lot of Snood . WHY IS THIS COLLECTION THE SUMMARY OF OUR FAMILY COMPUTER'S ACTIVITY FROM THE YEARS 2002-2005?) The closing looks were WORDS. Lots of em. Some looked like newspaper or tabloid headlines, and some were in electric clock fonts. In a few looks, they were attached to and appeared to be pouring out of the skinny-legged pants, and in others, were printed on ninja star-shaped marshmallows held together by their corners. I couldn't figure out what this was getting at, but have a feeling it has to do with bringing communication to a new medium. HA. Yeah, that's all I got. As a look, I dig it, though. There were then pieces that weren't so obviously on the same wavelength as the collection's concept when broken down, but still felt just as modern. Palettes from Spring were updated , grey coats like the one below were simple as silhouettes but calmly assertive. Same goes for the textural pants mixed with humble striped sweaters. Also? That dress next to the lil orange number? Needs to be styled with sheer Rodarte AW10 pants? Because it would look pretty and what I say goes? GOOD.
The dune itself is the tallest in the UAE at over 300 meters, and the grade of the hill is roughly 50 degrees. Sharp, huh?The turbocharged engines themselves costs $90,000 USD and up, and some drivers watch that $90,000 go up in flames. Going...Going...Gone!The driver in the shot above slowly reversed down the dune, and got out unscathed. This driver was not so lucky.He rolled forward a couple of times up the hill, and then, after watching the video on youtube, he rolled what looked to be about 18+ complete turns down to the bottom of the hill.Through the grapevine we are told that the driver did not survive. If any readers can provide additional information, that would be helpful.You can read more about the Liwa Festival and the Mureeb Challenge in this article by The National. As mentioned in a previous post, it does rain in the desert. November-February tend to be the wetter months, but random storms are known to occur outside of the 'winter' months. I snapped these shots several weeks ago (using my mobile camera) when the UAE was hit with a series of rainstorms that our storm sewers simply couldn't accommodate. I was on my way home from work, and couldn't believe the amount of standing water.Later that same evening, there was so much water in the Khalidiya part of town that parked sedans were victims of the 'wake' caused by moving traffic. Many of them had water splashing midway up the door.My students reacted to the rain much the way kids in the U.S. respond to snow. They were happy to dance around and enjoy it while it lasted
the culprit, circle side in... We haven't taken it out to play yet, but I'm sure we will soon. That means sooner or later a 'Jeep' post will be in the future! Probably later than sooner, because it's not broke in yet. But when that day comes, you'll know! I left out the details on this post &amp; just wanted to get back into the swing of things. I miss you all &amp; look forward to new adventures in this new year!.......Sooner than later....... Just a quick note to let you know I have been a little busy lately. In October, my laptop with all my saved pictures decided not to work anymore, (I did buy a new one), so it has been hard for me to write on the blog. Most people have put their motorcycles away for winter, so riding has been limited also. I miss riding &amp; writing and will be back at this A.S.A.P!It IS the Holidays and things have been crazy for everyone, I'm sure.                                                               From My family to yours                                                                ~HAPPY HOLIDAYS~ View Larger MapAs most of you already know, I bought a new camera and needed an excuse to use it, so on Saturday October 31st we headed out for a ride. As you can tell from the map, it wasn't a long ride, but we cruised the many curves and made it an all day event anyway.We stopped in Hornitos (which is a very small community) to use the facilities and wet our whistle. Check out this antique cash register that is still in use!As we were gettin
Just a quick post to let you all know that St Vincent's Op Shop&nbsp; (10 Costas Drive, Hoppers Crossing) are open on Sundays from 11am (not too sure it could be 10am) to 3 pm. This is the only op shop, that I know of, which is open on Sundays AND their items are still reasonably priced! Do you know of any other op shops that are open on Sundays? If so do tell! Till next time... VF P.S. I'm holding my first ever giveaway! Make sure you enter at http://www.vintagefokus.blogspot.com/ Before I became a stay at home Mum, I worked in South Melbourne. I would visit the Emerald Hill Op-Shop at least once a week and found quite a few bargains over the years. I dropped in when I was last in South Melbourne, which I think was some time last year. The shop had changed and it was quite pricey. I found this movie on ABC iView all about the ladies that have run the shop for years. You can see an excerpt here. An unexpected op shop visit to the Red Cross Shop in the mall in Oakleigh yielded this pretty floral sheet for $5. I'm going to use it for fabric - I've already created a lined wrap skirt for my Etsy shop, and there's still quite a bit left to make something else. Vinnies in Crewe Street, Oakleigh, is great for books. Au Revoir by Mary Moody (once a presenter on Gardening Australia) made me want to run away to France, too (mind you, I'd run away to almost anywhere I'm so keen to go travelling again!). The red book is a great basic guide to knitting, in the Pelham Craft Series (I have another of these on soft toy making) and published in 1973. It might actually encourage me to learn a couple of new stitches and make something other than socks and scarves! Each of these was a mere $1. I did a spot of op-shopping this weekend and found this gorgeous retro print of a little boy and his dog standing in the rain. I think it is a “kitsch” type of print but I’m just guessing from what little research I’ve done on the net . It is very “vintage” and I thought it would be a perfect addition to the nursery – not to mention too cute to pass on. http://www.vintagefokus.blogspot.com/ There is a run of good opshops along this road. Vinnies, the Salvos, and another which supports a local charity. I dropped into each of them yesterday while I was over that side of town (I'm not often over there), and bought these few items: Wrist watch marked at $20, I paid $10. The metal on the band of my old watch has gone strange, kind of gritty, and is uncomfortable against my skin, so I thought it was about time for a new one. I like plain clear faces on watches, with numerals instead of dots, so this is ideal. The Salvos were having a 'everything is half price' day, otherwise I might not have paid $20 for it. This is one of those cards that has digital sound when you open it - this one being kookaburras laughing. They are one of my favourite birds, so for $4 I grabbed it, just for fun. I've been looking for something cool to swan around the house in on hot days, and would have preferred cotton, but it is very hard to find 100% cotton clothes these days, so I settled for this shift thingy for $6. I've lost some of these hooks from our curtains over the years, and have never got around to replacing them, so when I saw a box of these for 20c each, it was finally time to fix those darn curtains! I'd arranged to meet friends for coffee, and they said if they weren't in the cafe, they'd be in the opshop nearby, and sure enough, that's where they were. I'd been in the same shop two days ago, but for a small shop they have a fast turnover, and there is always new stuff! I found this really ugly blouse for $1, with pretty machine embroidered Xmas motifs on it. When I got home, I cut out the motifs and cut off the buttons. The rest of the shirt is in hubby's rag bag. Somebody had apparently been to the USA and bought a heap of souvenir cloth badges, but never got around to sewing them on to articles of clothing. I'll be cutting them up to embellish fabric postcards, ATCs, or other patchwork. 40 cents each. I love anything with Peacocks, so I wasn't going to leave this little brass dish beind - 50 cents! There was a basket full of laces for $1 a roll, so I grabbed these to share with a friend in the USA who loves laces. The lady at the counter said "Oh that lace has been going out the door today!" and I wondered what else I'd missed out on! These finds are from a trip to Frankston in December, to take advantage of one of Saver's half price garment Mondays. There are enough op shops in the main shopping area to make a day trip a worthwhile exercise - I think I visited five, including Savers. Above are a jumper and cardigan which I intend to deconstruct for the yarn. You can't ever have too much yarn :) The purple cardi has giant snaps down the front, which I'll also reclaim and repurpose. I'd priced snaps about this size in the haberdashery section a while back and they retail for at least $1 each, and I have six of them now. Both knits were two or three dollars each. A large scarf featuring a gorgeous print of horses. I tried to convince the checkout operator that scarves are apparel, but apparently they're considered accessories and not included in the half price offer. Still a bargain at $3.95, I think. I may turn this one into a halter top, if I can bear to cut it. A cowboy motif doona cover that I'll use as fabric. I couldn't resist the cute print. Enough here to make a shirt, a skirt and still have some left over. Can't remember the price exactly, but it was about $5. A gorgeous green caftan, for me to wear in the heat. Cool and comfortable now that I've altered it to my satisfaction: it was a little tight over the Rack of Doom, so I let it out at the side seams only to find that this rendered it rather shapeless in other areas. So I added a couple of waist ties to tie at the back and now I love it. $9 at Savers. An "Eight Wives of Henry the VIII" tea towel, to be refashioned into a tote bag. $1.95. (Edited: Obviously that was meant to be "Six Wives of Henry VIII" - I think Melbourne's hot and muggy spell has damaged my brain) An Isle of Wight tea towel, also to be refashioned into a tote bag. Also $1.95. Both tea towels from Savers. On the same trip, I also bought ten balls of black mohair yarn, at $1 a ball in St Vinnies, plus a set of dominoes for $2 in another op shop (can't remember which, memory failure due to hot weather). Like I wrote earlier, can't have too much yarn! The dominoes are intended for a jewellery project I have in mind, and they came in a little wooden box that I'll use for something else. A good day. I would love to read about it if you did. I'd love to go on a trip like that, but I really don't need to...I do my own opshop tours without any help, lol. Popped into the local Brotherhood shop again today and found these goodies. It really is a neat little shop, they always seem to have new stuff coming in, and put it on the shelves within minutes of receiving and pricing it! They are just down the road from me; too close really....I can't resist dropping in when I walk by ;-) This cotton hand embroidered cloth was 40 cents. I've got hundreds, but this is so beautifully stitched, I couldn't leave it behind for that price. I fell in love with this enamel brooch for $4, thinking I would use it to embellish a crazy patchwork block, but when I got it home and had a closer look, I decided no, it's too good for that, so it's in my jewellery box. Here is the brooch again, with a bead necklace for 50 cents. I would normally not have looked twice at that, but have a look at the top I was wearing today - perfect match!!
I am not ashamed to say that I am a dork. An internet geek. Next to Ella, my computer is my best friend. And it's one of the best friends a girl could have. It doesn't give me attitude; it would never leave me for another user; it wouldn't borrow money and then disappear. Yes, I'm happy to say that our relationship is truly solid. That's not to say I haven't had some bad ones in the past, but ever since I got together with my Mac, it's been pure bliss... As a quick aside, I happen to love the series of Mac vs. PC ads created by Apple. In case you aren't familiar with them, here's one (I chose one with a dog in it for the sake of blog relevancy) Anyway, I hop into bed with Mac every night. Ella's not particularly happy to have to share the bed with him. She usually puts up a fight and tries to draw my attention away from his glossy screen by digging at the bed, climbing in my lap, or just plain barking in my face. Yes, my little girl is the epitome of subtle and mature. But, as with most, Ella can only hate on Mac for so long before she realizes that, well, he's pretty freakin' cool. See for yourselves... Don't be alarmed, folks. My Mac is NOT growing an odd, furry appendage... ...nor has Apple developed the technology to spawn animal hindquarters (at least, not to my knowledge)... That's just my Ella finally letting go of her completely unfounded objections to Mac... ...and feeling totally good about it. "Ohhhhh, man....it never felt this good with PC." How many creatures do you imagine could squeeze into my little shoebox of an apartment? Lord knows I've complained before about it being too small for Ella and myself, so any more than two would certainly be a bad idea, right? Well, for kicks, I decided to test that out Labor Day weekend when my parents (Ella's grandfurma and grandfurpa) came to stay with me and also brought their 12 year old dog, Jenna. "Five living things coexisting in a tiny apartment for 36 hours" may not actually break any Guinness world records , but I wonder if "Five living things almost losing their minds while failing to peacefully coexist in a tiny apartment" would? Ok well I should clarify that it was really the furry inhabitants that disturbed the peace. The drama began when I busted out the aerobed . Ella is not a fan of self-inflation - that much was made clear as she ran to her protector (the toilet bowl) to get away from the weird blue rapidly growing monster that makes "ssssssssssssss" noises... Of course, when faced with the choice of sleeping on the cold, hard bathroom floor, or cuddling with momma on the crazy bed, she demonstrated a miraculous recovery... Of course, that is not to say that Ella didn't try to recoup her spot on the real bed and tell grandma to bugger off... But the activity that caused all the humans in the shoebox to drink heavily and look for ways to pop the top off or bust through the sides or SOMETHING was the incessant posturing between Jenna and Ella. Momentarily fearful of the aerobed , they soon both decided to take it over. As you can see by their expressions, the take-over was not a joint effort and it would take a battle royale to determine who would ultimately become Queen of the Faux Mattress. Only Ella doesn't truly battle over anything because she doesn't take anything seriously. Yelling, lunging, barking, howling...all signs of play to my Ella. Dominance schmominance. Territory? Mi territory es su territory! No worries! Let's just play! Jenna's response? Shut it, kid...I haven't played in years and I'm not about to start with you... In the end, I'd call it a draw. Jenna and Ella agreed to disagree and the humans parted ways with hugs and headaches. If I were a journalist, I'd surely be fired for being this late on a story. Lucky for me, I'm not a journalist - I'm a blogger. And I've got puppy pics that are timeless in their adorability. I can even make up words like "adorability"...with this kind of freedom, why would anyone want to bother reporting on legitimate and current news? Anyway, in case you hadn't heard, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the development of the original design plans for Central Park, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation set up a hot air balloon ride for New Yorkers and visitors alike to catch a bird’s eye view of the City and the Park. The balloon was flying through August 22nd. Sorry you missed it. If the site's still up, you can get more detail on it here . (but why bother...it's over and done...perhaps you should just scroll down to the cute puppy pics below since that's what you're here for anyway) Strangely, dogs aren't weren't permitted on the balloon ride. Perhaps it's too risky having all that fur flying around so close to the flames of the burner (although I bet the FURminator could take care of that)...Or maybe it's because the basket wasn't intended for quadrupeds, so allowing them would mean fewer riders per trip and less $$ in the balloon company's pocket (Cue hard-nosed journalistic headline: "Dogs keep Aeroballoon's profits from reaching the sky")... Honestly my biggest concern was that Ella would have caught the urge to indulge her predatory bird instinct at 500 feet in the air. So we thought it best to admire the balloon from the safety of the ground at Cherry Hill . Sorry I don't have any aerial shots for you, but aren't pics of Ella with her tongue hanging out WAY cuter? Enjoy. And here are some views of the balloon from the northwest side of The Lake ... Ella LOVES horses... almost as much as horse poop. (sorry - but it's true...that sh-- is like doggie catnip!) But while she might admire them from afar as they majestically trot through the park, she isn't too keen on them being all up in her water trough. Only it's not technically Ella's trough (try telling her that). This is one of the troughs along Central Park South dedicated to the carriage horses by the ASPCA . And the truth of the matter is that Ella is too much of a diva to stick her head in and drink directly from the trough anyway. Momma had to fill her portable plastic cup from the spigot like we do at all the other people-dedicated water fountains (momma's actually ok with that - if you saw how dirty that water was, you would be too). Anyway, point is, Ella was really lapping up that nice cold water in her clean personal cup when she came face to face with the one animal she has never (yet) tried to incite play with (thank god)... Horse to Ella: "You betta check yo'self." Horse again to Ella: "Uh huh, that's what I thought." Ella to Horse: (mumbling under her breath) "Oh come on this is getting ridiculous now. Nobody needs THAT much water..." Ella to herself: "OK THAT IS IT! I'm about to make my move if this horse doesn't trot on in 10 seconds." Ella to Momma: "Momma are you sure you don't have any Poland Spring in your bag? I am so parched..." You might have noticed that I've been a bit light with the blog postings lately. I can't deny it - guilty as charged. But there are extenuating circumstances, I swear. I have proof. Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A. Meet Ella - The Energizer Puppy. If I didn't know better, I'd swear she was plugged into the wall somewhere because her energy just never seems to drain. It is my only mission in life to find SOMETHING that will tire Ella out so that momma can get a moment to relax (is ONE moment too much to ask for?). Thankfully, I recently managed to find something that occupied Ella for one evening (hey, I'll take it) - a puppy-sized stuffed toy creatively named "Monkey". I owe Monkey a great deal for this - he not only filled in as Ella's playmate for an evening, but also provided priceless entertainment... Ella was so excited to meet Monkey that I didn't even have time to remove his tags and stickers before she pounced. Ella shows Monkey she ain't afraid of no primates. "Yeah, a lot of good those opposable thumbs are doing you now, eh Monkey?!!" "Say uncle! Say uncle!!" Ella puts Monkey in a head lock. He looks surprisingly comfortable. Monkey tries to gain advantage by tickling Ella - she laughs uncontrollably but won't relent. Time out. Like true competitors, in the end they lay down and snuggle and put the match behind them. (Wait, that's not what Nadal and Federer did after the finals of Wimbledon this year? Hmm. Humans are weird.) Anyway, Monkey succeeded in draining Ella's batteries for a little while. The question in my mind is, who will take on Ella next? Because right now, momma is saying uncle. UNCLE!!! "Oh, look!...is it a puppy?" "Yes, she's not quite 8 months." "Oh, she's beautiful. Is she trained?" "Um, how so? I mean, she housetrained but eh er uh..." Silence. "She's a good girl - for the most part. She's just got a lot of energy." "Well of course...she's a puppy! Is she a chewer?" "Definitely, yes, I'm going bankrupt buying bones to keep her mouth occupied!" "Does she chew on your shoes?" "Haha...well if there's no bone around, she's got to chew on something right?" -coughs, looks down at the ground out of embarrassment, scurries off- Look, don't blame me! I'm clearly doing all I can to train Ella properly. To ensure she chews only on designated toys and bones. To teach my furbaby the difference between a "good chew" and a "bad chew". Are you saying there's some reason Ella might think that because it's ok to chew on this toy... ...it's ok to chew on this too?... I don't see the connection. Sorry. Today was one of the most beautiful days we've had in NYC in a long time. Perhaps it's the relative lack of humidity that's got me feeling so good...or maybe I'm deficient in Vitamin D and the sunshine has replenished me...in truth I think I really owe it all to Christopher Cross. He's in my head, he won't leave, and I'm totally fine with it. As Ella and I made our way around the Conservatory Water in Central Park, we both found ourselves smiling at all of the sailboats. For those of you who aren't familiar, the Conservatory Water is an ornamental boat pond of sorts where people can casually sail (or race - for the true sportsman or uptight New Yorker) sailboats. It's a relaxing place to begin with, but the sailboats just add to the magic. And I couldn't help but set the whole scene to music - Christopher Cross's "Sailing" . I think I kept the theme music mostly inside my head, though I can't deny there may have been some humming aloud during the chorus. Now it's your turn to hum along... I recently relayed the news about Ella gutting her beloved Raffy. The loss was so sudden and shocking that I made the decision to keep Raffy's remains around for as long as I could. Sick, maybe...but with his stuffing fully gone, I figured he couldn't pose much of a threat to Ella's digestive system, and frankly I really like Raffy and am perfectly happy tossing his limp shell around the shoebox for Ella to chase. Earlier this evening, I noticed Ella was hiding under my desk, shooting me a guilty look out of the corner of her eye. I knew immediately that meant she had something in her mouth that she knew damn well she ought not to. I pried open her jaws of steel, and a round, brown, mushy ball-shaped thing dropped into my hand. I screamed bloody murder at first, thinking it was part of a bodily organ of another animal she'd killed, or a piece of some kind of nasty that she'd snuck in from the mean city streets...in a few seconds though, my squeals turned to hysterical laughter as I realized what it was. Ladies and gentlemen, exhibit A: And Exhibit B: And Exhibit C: Ella's wrath directed toward Raffy is relentless! The poor thing is now eviscerated and sans eye. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say Ella will take the other eye next and then move on to his ear. I will say, though...I've never seen ANYTHING keep Ella's attention quite so much as Raffy's eye. Perhaps I'll hold onto the eyes and use them as training treats. That might be a good, maximum incentive treat to use while we're practicing "Come"...even filet mignon couldn't top a furry eyeball apparently.
Oh I hear ya...He's just a two year old how hard could it be?Ah-ha, thought you'd never ask!Here's just one example of what I've been going through...Just the other day...I had to make a very important phone call. As the phone on the other end is ringing, I spotted Madisen and asked her to run and see where Jake was. ( As I know it only takes a second before he's into something.) "He's fine, Kailey's going to play with him while your on the phone." , She said.Approximately 20 minutes later I get off the phone, turn around, and see Jake walking towards me waddling like a duck. He's covered from head to toe with paint, making paint footprints behind him. "Look Mommy, I paint!!" he said in a lovely shade of purple.I can only imagine the haunting shade of white my face became, as the shock rushed over me. I immediately grabbed him up and went running for the bath tub. Screaming in panic for the girls to hurry and help, I went as fast as I could. "Strip your clothes off, and what ever you do, DO NOT let Jake out of the tub!!"I knew wherever the paint was, time was of the essence to get it up. As I followed the painted footprints imprinted in the carpet. (Of our RENTED house might I ad) I was led straight to the masterpiece corner! He had somehow managed to get open two containers of paint. One Red &amp; one blue.(Which were in a case and up high. Obviously not high enough!)Mr. Man, had painted the walls, his toys, his bed, his bedding, and HIMSELF!
It's been roughly nine months since I got a sweet F-bomb out of Gordon Ramsay over the name of my blog, "That would put a f---ing glass eye to sleep!" Three girls and I had dinner at Mojito in Brooklyn, one of Ramsay's fixer-uppers on "Kitchen Nightmares," and tonight's the night it all goes down live on Fox. Tune in at 9 p.m. ET/8C. It scares me to tell you to watch it, without having seen it myself, but it's sure to give you a good laugh. Let me know what you think, and if you've just recently discovered my blog, click here for the colorful write-up of that eventful evening. Unless you read her book, of course. I finished reading "My Life in France" two days ago and the movie " Julie &amp; Julia " just ended on my DVR. I wanted to know Julia Child through her own words first so I could test the movie against them (or the words she wrote with her beloved husband Paul Child's grand-nephew Alex Prud'homme). "My Life in France" was a delightful read. It made me nostalgic for my three adolescent years growing up in Paris while it also inspired me to take cooking classes. I don't know if I'm cut out for Le Cordon Bleu , but an introductory course somewhere might do. If you're at all interested in food or cooking I highly advise reading it from cover to cover. I can't wait to buy "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" (Volumes I and II) and "From Julia Child's Kitchen" (a book Julia calls her "favorite"). I'm still uninterested, however, in reading the blog-turned-book "Julie &amp; Julia" written by Julie Powell. I liked Powell's husband in the movie way more than I liked Powell (and I adore Amy Adams). I decided to share a few items that I found fascinating from Julia's tale. Here is a taste: 10. Julia attended Smith College. She majored in history and graduated in 1934. Her plan after college was to become a famous woman novelist. She sought employment at Time, Newsweek and The New Yorker and when she didn't get a job at either magazine, she worked in the advertising department at the W. &amp; J. Sloane furniture store. She made $25 a week. 9. Julia met Paul while working for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and "looking for adventure." The OSS was an intelligence agency formed during World War II. The two met in Ceylon (what is now Sri Lanka) in 1944; both were transferred with the OSS to Kunming, China; and in September of 1946 they were married. Paul had a black belt in judo and was a "physical person." He was a photographer and "his pleasure was in the act of creating." Paul took many of the photographs Julia used to inspire the artwork in her "Mastering" cookbook. Julia and Paul never got around to sending Christmas cards so instead they sent their family and friends homemade Valentine's Day cards. The more ridiculous the better. They seemed to be an adorable couple and I hope for that kind of married happiness someday. 8. One of Julia and Paul's first meals in France was at Restaurant La Couronne in Rouen, the city where St. Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. Julia described it as "the most exciting meal" of her life. She feasted on sole meuniere and oysters. The restaurant is considered to be the oldest inn in France established just a few years ago in 1345. 7. Julia was big on nicknames. Her sister Dorothy -- five years her junior -- was nicknamed "Dort the Wort" while Julia was called "Julia Pulia" and at some times even "Juke the Puke." Julia became a very good friend of the legendary James Beard (he asked Julia to call him Jim) and whenever they cooked together they were known as GiGi, as in Jim and Julie with the letter "j" pronounced the French way. 6. Julia attended her first cooking class at Le Cordon Bleu with 11 GIs who were "studying cooking under the auspices of the GI Bill of Rights." She was the star student, although she began unable to properly scramble an egg. 5. Julia sought a diploma from Le Cordon Bleu so she could teach but she failed the first exam. It was made of two parts: a written and practical exam. She aced the written but didn't know how to cook a single item on the practical exam. It included the following: an oeuf mollet , a veau "en surpise ," and caramel custard. Her teacher Chef Bugnard insisted that despite this debacle, Child was qualified to be a chef. She aced the second exam and became a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu. 4. On November 6, 1959, after more than seven years of collaboration, Julia's manuscript for a cookbook, co-written with two of her French friends Simone "Simca" Beck (later Madame Jean Fischbacher) and Louisette Bertholle, was rejected by the editor-in-chief at Houghton Mifflin for being "a big, expensive cookbook of elaborate information" that "might well prove formidable to the American housewife. She might easily clip one of these recipes out of a magazine but be frightened by the book as a whole." 3. The woman who would later be Julia's editor, Judith Jones, left New York for Paris in 1948 at the age of 24 for a three-week vacation, got her purse stolen and never left (her return ticket was in her purse). She was working for Doubleday in New York at the time and ended up getting a job as an editorial assistant to a Doubleday editor in Paris. She just so happened to pick up a book her boss was planning to reject, urged him to give it a second go and when he did, Doubleday bought it and it became a worldwide sensation. You may have heard of it: "Ann Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl." A similar situation happened with Julia's manuscript. Jones tested several of the recipes, realized what an incredible feat it was and insisted to her bosses it be published. In May 1960 Jones sent Julia the good news. "We have come to the conclusion it is a unique book that we would be very proud to have on the Knopf list." 2. The original title of "Mastering" was "French Recipes for American Cooks" and Jones said no way. Early contenders were "The Master French Cookbook" and "The French Cooking Master." Until finally "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." Et voila! Bon appetit! 1. Julia and Paul called their homes by names. They lived at 81 Rue de L'Universite in Paris and they called it "Rue de Loo." They called their property in Provence La Pitchoune or "Little Thing." Julia held onto La Peetch for nearly 30 years -- from 1965 until June 1992. Paul was 90 and living in a nursing home outside Boston at the time when she decided to move on from their "spiritual home." When asked if she was going to miss it, Julia replied, "I've always felt that when I'm done with something I just walk away from it -- fin !" She added, "the heart had gone out of it for me now." Sad, in a way, but I know exactly what she meant. Aphrodisiac: a food, drink or drug that stimulates sexual desire; a thing that causes excitement. We've all heard of the term, and at one point or another, I'm sure we've all consumed one or several of them. Has it made you hornier or more of a sex machine? The jury's out, but for a different take on the Valentine's Day list of restaurants, here's my top 10 sexual helpers paired up with the places you can find them in New York City. Have fun and best of luck with finding love and some heat this weekend. 10. Asparagus Asparagus “stirs up lust in man and woman," wrote a 17th century herbalist. Asparagus is a great source of potassium, fiber, vitamin B6, vitamins A and C, and thiamin and folic acid. Folic acid is known for boosting histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm in both sexes. You'll find the best asparagus dish in the city at Riposo 72 . The sleeper wine bar on the Upper West Side grills its asparagus and wraps them in prosciutto and a thin layer of melted parmesan. It's to die for. 9. Avocado Like the asparagus, the avocado is rich in folic acid. And just look at it. Its shape alone is sexual. So much so that Catholic priests in Spain once forbade it. The best way to eat avocado is sliced on a sandwich, in sushi or chopped up in guacamole. For the first, head to Cafe Ronda for their chipotle sandwich with chicken, onions and avocados. For sushi head to BondSt for their salmon avocado roll. You'll find the best guacamole in the city at Mama Mexico on the Upper West Side or at any Rosa Mexicano location. The freshly-made guac is the stuff and both of these Mexican-themed restaurants chop the avocado right in front of you. 8. Bananas In addition to potassium, bananas contain chelating minerals and the bromeliad enzyme, that are believed to enhance the male libido. Look at your significant other, start pealing one and eat it in front of him or her with a straight face. Have fun with that. The only bananas I've eaten in this city, excluding the ones for 60 cents at my office cafeteria, have been on pancakes. Head to Norma's for a sick short stack. Their banana-macadamia nut flap jacks with whipped banana and brown sugar butter are off the charts. 7. Foie Gras I've never been a huge fan of foie gras (or how they treat the ducks in the process), but if you're a Francophile in search of some loving, hit up Bar Boulud . They have an excellent selection of foie gras and pates. Try their country pate foie gras with truffle juice and port. Whether it's the ingredients or the fine food's mystique that grabs you, if eating it makes you feel sexy, go for it. 6. Basil Smelling basil alone puts me under. Head to Kuma Inn for their steamed edamame with Thai basil-lime oil. If you prefer going the Italian route, head to Gradisca for a couple of options. Not only is this one of my favorite Italian spots in the city, but it's romantic as well and you can try their caprese salad with basil or the cavatelli pasta with tomato, eggplant and basil. 5. Pine Nuts Pine nuts are high in zinc -- a mineral necessary to maintain male potency. Kefi has an incredible dish with pine nuts: the sheep's milk dumplings with tomatoes, pine nuts and warm, soft feta. If I could I would eat at Kefi once a week. An alternative to the dumplings would be Frederick's caprese salad with pine nuts sprinkled on top. 4. Chocolate Chocolate contains chemicals thought to effect neurotransmitters in the brain. The Aztecs once called chocolate the "nourishment of the gods." Sfoglia serves an incredible pasta dish with chocolate: its gnocchi with mushroom and chocolate shavings. If you'd rather have chocolate in a sexy dessert, head to Artisanal for their romantic chocolate fondue. 3. Garlic The "heat" in garlic is said to stir sexual desires. I eat garlic in just about anything, but one of my favorite dishes in the city is at Esperanto . They serve mussels on the half shell, roasted with garlic, topped with parmesan and paprika. Pair the mussels with one of Esperanto's exceptional Brazilian cocktails and you're sure to score big this weekend. Good also flaunts its mussels with tons of garlic in addition to white wine, herbs and grilled country bread. 2. Wine We all know red wine can be awfully seductive and this city has its fair share of places to find it. Though wine bars have a rather effeminate sound to them, don't fear, gents, bring your gal to one of these low-key spots and you'll be a hit. Riposo 72 makes it on the aphrodisiac list twice. You don't even have to taste the wine here to feel sexy -- you'll feel hot just holding their huge wine glasses. Their cozy warm atmosphere is heavy on the romance as well. Taste is another favorite of mine for vino. For more generous pours head to i Trulli , Peasant , Bar Boulud , Grape and Grain , and clo wine bar at Columbus Circle. If you want to stay in with your honey, head to Morrell's in Rockefeller Center or 67 Wine for my two favorite wine stores in the city. 1. Oysters The Romans were the first to label oysters as an aphrodisiac. There are many places to find oysters in New York City. The best in my book is Aquagrill in the West Village. Some runners-up would be Grand Central Oyster Bar , Jack's Luxury Oyster Bar and Morimoto . If you're in the mood for surf and turf, grab some oysters at my new favorite steakhouse Keen's . "ARE YOU ALIVE?????? WHEN CAN WE GET DINNER?!?!??" asked FunStar. She's always so dramatic. She produces a cable news show and they type the rundown in all caps and I think she forgets to turn off her work type from time to time. I still love her. FunStar sent me a few of these e-mails starting back in November and it took us until the first week in January to get together. She always has a wish list of places to try -- a few years back she had an Excel spreadsheet -- so I asked her to e-mail me the ones at the top of this list. Excel or no excel, when I saw Momofuku Ssam Bar on the list, I got fired up. Johnny Depp is to the Academy Award as I formerly was to David Chang's restaurants. (If you don't know Chang, please read this article before you proceed. You will not regret it. I wish Larissa MacFarquhar did profiles on all of New York City chefs. I've had a crush on the guy ever since.) Momofuku restaurants have been eluding me for years. Much like Babbo once was to me, the restaurants in the Momofuku family had an unattainable quality to them. I would hear someone asking if I'd tried Momofuku Ko, if I liked Momofuku Noodle Bar, if I wanted to go to Ssam Bar and I'd throw my head back, roll my eyes and give them a loud "Pfffhhaa! Good luck." I am the first to admit that if a restaurant is notoriously hard to get into I will avoid it at all costs, or wait around until it's uncool to try it. Sadly, neither Momofuku Ssam Bar nor any of its sister restaurants are getting any uncooler so FunStar gave me the kick in the pants I needed to swallow my ferocious pride and give it a whirl. There was one slight problem. Over the past four months I've been eating strictly vegetarian. I feared eating at one of Chang's spots would be a total disaster. I even asked my Twitter followers and @eaterny if there was a point in me trying Momofuku Ssam Bar. The responses were mixed. One person wrote: don't go to momo if you're a vegetarian there are better choices. Another wrote: pork buns and spicy rice cakes...and compost cookies. Drool. While a third wrote: There are fish options and a veg or 3. I consulted the menu and it looked doable. We would dine at Momofuku Ssam Bar despite FunStar being concerned about her having to eat all the meat dishes by herself. I told her she'd live. I showed up at 8:25-ish. The place was a zoo, yet the hostess came and found me like a magnet. When I told her I was waiting for my friend running late from work, she pointed me in the direction of the Milk Bar and said she'd come in to check on me to see if my second party had arrived. I couldn't get over how friendly she was. I was surprised by the simplicity of the decor in Ssam Bar. The tables were like picnic benches with an Asian flare. The chairs were backless. Folks at tables were to the right side (and there weren't a lot of them) and to the other side was the bar. It seemed like some of the tables were communal. Both the bar and table areas took up an equal amount of space in the dining room. The decor wasn't the hype here, or the coziness. The food was. Backless chairs don't lend well to settling in and hanging around for hours. The horizontal wood paneling and table design reminded me of that of the Chelsea pizzeria Co. I wasn't entirely sure what the hostess meant by the Milk Bar. I knew it was attached but visually I couldn't see what she meant. I just kept following the narrow space between the bar and the tables, saw the bright light of the open kitchen at the far end of the dining room and found another hallway. At the end of this hallway there were large groups of people standing in line for bakery items, ranging from cookies and cakes to ice cream and soft serve. I guess it doubled as the waiting room. I plopped my pur-ggage on the table with a thud and made it clear I'd be staying for a while. I whipped out Julia Child's "My Life in France" and began to alternate between reading a few paragraphs and checking out the commotion around me. I heard about four different accents in the span of 20 minutes: Bostonian, Australian, German and French. This place was no secret to foreigners. Everyone knew and idolized Chang. The four young 20-something dudes behind me were drooling over what pork plate they were going to get, how Chang's fried chicken was "bad ass," and how they wanted 
 compost cookie for later. What the hell was a compost cookie? I looked up and saw it had pretzels, potato chips, butterscotch, coffee, oats and chocolate and any other crumbs lying around the kitchen Chang and his chefs could find. This was right up my alley. A petite blond college student in front of me was going on and on to her two friends about balancing studying with her long-distance boyfriend and how she was really more into hooking up locally with randoms than having a committed relationship with someone who was far away. Her boring "far away" man was in Boston. I was tempted to blurt out her ridiculous whining on Overheardinnewyork.com , but I decided to continue reading instead. Where was FunStar? The hostess came to check on me at least one more time before FunStar arrived. I couldn't believe how incredible the service was. She could have just dumped me in the back and waited for me to come find her when FunStar got there but no. She kept her word and made sure I was still solo. When FunStar did come she went and found our hostess. I almost told her not to worry she was looking out for us but I was getting pretty hungry at this point after all the compost talk so if FunStar could expedite the seat process I'd be thrilled. "Mona!" She waved at me at the end of the hallway connecting the Milk Bar to Ssam. "Really? Ready? Coming!" I shoved my book and gloves and hat and scarf in my pur-ggage and flew off to start our Ssam adventure. We snagged a great front seat at the bar. This was perfect. We could look at the menu, ask questions and watch the bartenders at work -- one of my favorite things to do. "So...I need an update. Like NOW!" "OK, OK... Christmas was incredible. We had the best time," I replied. "Can I get you guys a drink?" Asked a tall thin guy with a chunk of his blond hair spiked in the front and pointing off to the right like an arrow. He was wearing an interesting two-toned green T-shirt and when he stepped away it reminded me of the old hyper-color tees. "Oh shoot. We haven't gotten that far yet," I responded. "OK, let's choose our drinks and then you'll tell me what happened," said FunStar. FunStar told me about a drink she'd had recently called a French 75. Her version was made of Champagne, gin (though some recipes call for cognac or brandy) and lemon juice. We asked the bartender if he could make one. There were cocktails with Champagne on the menu, but he had an idea they weren't supposed to use Champagne for cocktails they didn't have on the menu. It sounded strange to us, but he was very smiley and friendly so we didn't think twice about it. I asked him about the seasonal pickle brine martini with Plymouth gin. To this dirty martini nut it sounded delish. I chose the classic with gin and FunStar went with a vodka version. "OK. Spill it!" "So... we met at our friend's wedding --" "Dude. I know that part. Fast forward to more recent," she ordered. "Ha! OK, OK. I don't remember what you know and what you don't know. We've seen each other four times now. He came to New York once and I went to Los Angeles twice--" "So you met him and you've seen him three times since and you're totally gonzo!?" "I know, I know. It must sound totally insane. But I'm totally insane about him. If you asked me to describe my dream man physically and emotionally it would be him. I just feel so lucky!" "I'm so happy for you!" "Christmas was a total whirlwind. We went whale-watching with his parents. Our parents met at dinner. Everyone got along super well. I spent a week with the fam and then I flew down to L.A. to be with him for four days. It was so awesome." "Wow," she responded. "Do you guys have any questions about the menu?" "Oh... we haven't even looked. Sorry..." "Let's pick out food and we'll keep talking after," suggested FunStar. "Done and done." We looked at the menu and there were a bunch of items that jumped out at us. We tried as much as we could between two girls, one being a vegetarian. As our first cocktails dried up, the bartender informed us he'd inquired about making the French 75 and that he could in fact use the champagne for items not on the drinks menu. It was very sweet of him to pursue this further, because we had certainly forgotten, so we ordered up a round of French 75s and kept ogling at the menu. We copied our neighbors and tried the cured hamachi with edamame, horseradish and pea leaves. The horseradish was charred black and I could have eaten the crumbles by the pint. The hamachi was light and fresh with an edamame sauce. The horseradish saved this dish from being bland. Next we tried the cracked Jonah crab claws with harissa mayo. Like I mentioned below at Choptank , crab claws don't really do it for me. I tried to suck all the meat and juice out of the smallest claw and it was a lot of work for not a lot of substance. Next time I eat a crab it'll be a full sucker. FunStar wasn't impressed either. FunStar tried the steamed pork buns with hoisin, cucumbers and scallions. Ever since eating at Kuma Inn I've loved the white gooey, almost marshmallow-like bun with pork belly. I kept to my vegetarian ways and just tried a sliver of the foamy bread and wished I could have had a plain side of the bun. I bet if I'd asked I could have. Rats. We finished up with the bread and butter plate with two types of butter: sea salt from Vermont and whipped lardo. The bread was disappointing. It was thick and heavy on the tough crust with too little soft on the inside. Maybe Chang should outsource the one thing he's not an expert in -- French bread (sorry FCI). S'il est deja en train de faire ceci, je suis tres desole. The butter, however, was ridiculous, especially the lardo. It was so rich it could have been cheese. I almost wanted to eat it plain with a spoon. I knew it would give me a heart attack so I refrained, but man. Who knew butter could be so flavorful? Chang. That's who. Last and definitely not least, we tried the fried brussels sprouts with mint and a fish sauce vinaigrette. With all the hype surrounding Momofuku we hadn't been all that moved by the food... until the brussels sprouts. I don't care if you've never liked or tried a brussels sprout in your life, this is one of New York's finest dishes. No joke. I couldn't figure out if I wanted to just inhale them or eat them slowly so they'd last longer. A couple sitting next to us asked what they should get and besides the pork belly and the hamachi I yelled with brussels sprouts hanging out of my mouth, "THUH BRUHTHULL THPROUTHS!" "So? Tell me more about MaineMan!!?" Throughout dinner it was a battle to consume what was in front of us and each other's lives over the past six months. "So... what is it about him, Mona?" I think I have a face now whenever someone mentions him. It's called MaineMan face and I get called out on it constantly. I light up like the tree and ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center. "I always told my mom I needed to find myself a mountain man, a manly man, someone who was tough as nails on the outside, but a soft, sensitive guy on the inside. MaineMan is that guy." "I love it!" "I don't know. I'll always be an athlete at heart. And I've always needed someone equally as tough as me, both emotionally and physically, and I always found it hard to be attracted to someone who wasn't. This probably sounds ridiculous..." "NO! Go on." "I couldn't date a wuss or a whiner. I've never met someone tougher, more active and more ready for an adventure than he is. I asked him if he wanted to do a marathon and he said, 'Yeah, sure!' without a second thought. Are you kidding me!?" "I know exactly what you mean. We're both tough cookies. I needed that too," she added. It was a huge relief that what I was saying wasn't gibberish. "Right?! Yet, at the same time, he's a complete love... a total softie. So anyway...he's amazing and there isn't a second of any day where I don't doubt or question what he's thinking or feeling. Because he tells me all the time. It's never a mystery. And he lives across the country! I dated someone who I practically lived with who never said the sweet things MaineMan says to me. I really can't..." "Mona!" "... believe how lucky I am to have found..." "Mona!" "...him. I just feel so..." "Mona!" "Oh god, sorry. What?" "You're totally glowing. It's so great. GLOW-ING! I'm sooooo soooo happy for you." "Aww, thanks FunStar! It's just crazy. And I totally get it now." We wrapped up dinner, thanked our bartender profusely for taking such good care of us and headed to the Milk Bar for some dessert. FunStar had tried the cookies before and kept saying "blueberry blueberry blueberry" in my ear. I barely like fruit as it is so the thought of eating blueberries in a cookie just sounded borderline revolting. MaineMan teases me for being the only vegetarian he knows who doesn't like vegetables and fruit. After staring at the blackboard for a good solid five minutes and not really registering what was happening I gave in. We went with the blueberry and cream cookie and the compost cookie. These are the only two cookies you're allowed to try if you go to Chang's Milk Bar. They were soft, gooey, chewy and I wanted to wrap myself in them. Just how a cookie ought to be. "We’re not the best cooks," Chang once told The New Yorker back in March 2008. "We’re not the best restaurant -- if you were a really good cook you wouldn’t be working here, because really good cooks are a--holes. But we’re gonna try our best, and that’s as a team." Chang is no bulls--- artist. And his food is no bulls--- either. I don't know if I'll ever be ready to fight the minions to get into Momofuku Ko, but I am psyched to know I can count on a bar stool at Ssam for brussels sprouts, lardo, a strong cocktail, great service and a warm compost cookie for dessert. Drool indeed. 207 2 Avenue, at 13th St. 212) 254-3500 Worked on this opus for 12 long hours yesterday. I found some great new friends on the Web, while reaching out to some old friends as well. I hope you enjoy these recipes! I'm seriously rethinking my decision to become a vegetarian after compiling this (but I won't, Winette, don't fret). I'm off to sunny Orlando with @Jcole this weekend. Disneyworld wedding, here we come. Until next week, friends. And you can click here for last year's rendition for another 10 gluttonous dishes. "Hey! We're going to grab dinner tonight at Choptank. Would you guys like to join? It looks v. yummy, classic B'more food," wrote Fashionista. "Only if you promise the hush puppies will be authentic. I'm in," said BYOWino. Fashionista made reservations for five of us at Choptank, the new Chesapeake Bay-themed restaurant in the west village. She's a sucker for anything that says Maryland or crabs so I knew it wouldn't be long until we ended up there, whether it was for FTDC or another occasion. My friend Sunkist was visiting from Colorado and I asked Fashionista if we could crash her and JerseyBoy's date night at Choptank. Every Friday they are in town they pick a restaurant off Eater's 38 (their list of essential New York dining spots). For this place they were making an exception. I wanted Fashionista to meet Sunkist and after a full day of back-to-back dance classes, I knew Sunkist would be up for a good, hearty meal. Sunkist and I went to school together in Charlottesville and we moved to Snowmass, Colo., after 9/11. Sunkist went from being the star of Aspen's Crystal Palace to producing her own children's plays in Aspen. She is opening up a dance studio as well and part of her goal in coming to New York was to brushen up on some of the hottest trends in dance. I could devote an entire post to our hip hop class at the Ailey Dance Studio , but I'll save that humiliation and embarrassment for only my closest friends (and the unlucky passersby who got to watch my sorry butt wiggle and wag in the Ailey fishbowl studio). Unfortunately, Sunkist had a class that night that went until nine. Reservations were at 8:30. "We can shower at the studio so we can be quick to meet up," she texted. I don't think Sunkist understood the whole New York reservation situation. I told her we'd play it by ear, knowing that we'd probably end up eating and meeting her somewhere after. Little Annie's in Aspen may let you hang out and casually wait for friends to arrive, but New York tables didn't quite work that way. I'd already asked Fashionista to change her reservation once and I didn't feel like making her do it again. I e-mailed a few friends who I thought would be interested in dinner and we had one taker: BYOWino. Sunkist would join us later after her class and either sit with us or at the bar, depending on the space. I was the first one to show up at Choptank. Since I'd been the annoying friend adjusting and readjusting our reservation, I was not going to be the annoying late friend. I walked in and felt sort of lost in the overly large empty space at the front for standing, checking in and waiting. There were two high tables with stools on either side of the door by the windows. One couple sat with their Blackberries lit on the table. He would answer, she would stare off into space, he would hang up; she would answer, he would stare off into space, she would hang up. This little dance continued for about 10 minutes. They seemed to be meeting more people like I was, yet they had drinks and I did not. Hmmph. After checking in I sat down opposite them and watched the place in action. The entrance space was straight up awkward. The bar behind the check-in table was a good four or five stairs up from ground level. They should have expanded the bar further towards the window and increased their stool surface area, while decreasing the over-sized pointless space in front. As soon as Fashionista, JerseyBoy and BYOWino arrived, we exchanged hugs, left our tired winter coats with a host and headed off to our table. The main dining area scored high on the cool meter. Choptank was dominated by its two huge square-shaped bars in the middle of the room. The space with tables (and those who weren't cool enough to make the cut at bar seats) seemed like a lame after-thought. If you go to Choptank, eat at the bar. I immediately wished I was meeting one person instead of three so I could sit in front of the bartenders, drink out of a big wine glass and stare at the oysters all night. The place was completely packed, yet somehow we scored the best table in the place - the end table right by the window. The dining area loops around to the left. After you pass the two bars you head down a few stairs again for the five or six tables on ground level. We were big fans of the corkboard on each wall. "I think we need to come in next time with a photo of all of us and just stick it up there," said Fashionista. "Hells YES! Right in the middle of all the beach and sand scenes," said BYOWino. "I love this plan," I added. I hope the wall has since filled up since we visited. It was looking a little sparse. Our waitress came to the table for our drink order. Fashionista and I ordered a couple of cocktails while the boys ordered beers. Our waitress was friendly and mildly attentive, but as sharp as a used piece of chewing gum. "What happened to the hush puppies? That was one of the reasons I came," said BYOWino, half-jokingly, half-serious. "Well...they had those in the beginning for our soft opening, then the chef must have taken them off the menu." "Why?" "I have no idea." "Does the crab chowder have corn in it?" Fashionista asked. "I have no idea." "Do you mind...err... finding out?" "Oh, you want me to find out? OK, sure." The cocktails were pretty intense. Mine was the size of a pint-glass and half-filled with ice. Potent. Fashionista's came out and I wanted to ask, "That's it?" It looked awfully silly next to my gargantuan drink. She tasted hers and was unhappy. It was a bit too heavy on the gin and you could barely taste the St. Germain, not to mention it was warm and would have tasted a million times better chilled. I liked mine, mostly for the ginger and huge ice cubes, and would definitely order it again. For starters we tried the crab claws. We tried ordering the crab dip and chips off the menu, but the waitress informed us each table got a complimentary order. This was a nice gesture, but perhaps best to take that off th
Hey kids.. sorry, but you probably won't be seeing a post on my Daring Baker challenge this weekend. Unfortunately what I thought was a simple cold has gotten worse and it's about kicked my arse. Combine that with work and my procrastination issues and well.. no Tiramisu in my kitchen this month. :( I did buy all the ingredients, so I'm ready to go in that respect.. just need my nose to dry the freeg up and then figure out a way to assassinate the lil fuckers in my head who are pounding the backs of my eyeballs with sledgehammers. Gah. So we'll see.. In the meantime, check out the Daring Bakers blogroll for 1000's of creative and beautiful Tiramisu participants.. everyone did (as usual!!) an amazing job with the challenge! Huge hugs to both Deeba and Aparna for being wonderful hostesses this month.. they picked an awesome challenge of making homemade mascarpone and lady finger cookies! From what I've read in our private forums, both of the recipes are delicious! I REALLY want to find out for myself! xoxo I had heard of the croque-monsieur sandwich often in the past year or so.. apparently it's making the rounds in the foodie-blog world, since that's where I discover many foods I'd never heard of before. It sounded intriguing, something I might want to try one day, but nothing to add to the MUST MAKE list. I mean seriously, it's a grilled ham &amp; cheese sammie. No big whoop. And then I was going through some magazine last week - for the life of me I can't remember what it was called - and saw this photo of the most awesome looking sandwich I'd ever seen. It had a fried egg on top! I don't think I've ever spoke of my obsession? fascination? complete and utter GLEE when it comes to the fried egg, specifically the yolk. But there's a twist. Yes, I love fried eggs for breakfast (or dinner) with the usual accoutrements - buttered toast, sausage or bacon, hashbrowns, you know.. heart attack on a plate? :) But this obsession - fascination - complete and utter glee that I feel when I see something topped with a friend egg, that normally wouldn't be topped with an egg.. I just.. can't find the words without sounding gross. Salivate upon seeing oozing yolk is what it is, but frankly, I just grossed myself out by saying that. Salivate and oozing really shouldn't be in the same sentence. Hopefully you yolk lovers out there will get where I'm coming from.. if not.. maybe try to block out what you've just read by closing your eyes tightly and singing LA LA LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU MISS GROSS-Y MCGROSSTER extremely loudly until the images go away. :P It was the mental vision of a crispy baked sammie loaded with cheese and that broken yolk oozing (I can't stop with the fakkin oozing! Someone give me a better word for crissakes - and don't say "runny" cuz that squicks me out too!) down the side of it that had me in such a tizz.. hell it could have been a rabbit turd &amp; peat moss sandwich and I would have been drooling all because of that egg. I once saw a salad made of greens, roasted sweet potato chunks and a big old fried egg on top and although I haven't made it YET, I still drool over the thought of it. A salad with roasted chunks of sweet potato for crissakes? All because of that ooz glorious fried egg. Anyhoo... As I read the intro to the recipe and realized it was a croque-monsieur with a fried egg thrown on top, the sandwich jettisoned to the MUST MAKE list tout de suite. So I ripped the pages out, brought it home to show hubbs and he agreed, we needed to have this for dinner ASAP. Basically, if ya'll haven't heard of the croque-monsieur, it's ham &amp; cheese (usually gruyère or emmental) between two slices of bread that have been slathered with a bechamel sauce, and then more cheese on top. It's baked until the edges are lightly browned and the cheese is melty and bubbly. Once it comes out of the oven, you slap a fried egg on top to create the croque- madame , throw a nice salad next to it and call it heaven on a plate. I made a few changes to the recipe. I couldn't find the jambon de Paris ham it called for, so I used prosciutto. I'm not a big bechamel sauce by itself kinda gal, so I decided to doctor it up by tossing in a couple generous handfuls of gruyère (I still had quite a bit left over from the bread ) and just the barest peench of ground mustard. I used a loaf of French miche, which I bought at Panera - miche, I assume, means fakking huge. It's a very large square loaf of French bread just perfect for grilling, baking, toasting and of course, making a croque-madame. :) Hubbs made a cucumber, tomato, olive &amp; red onion salad in balsamic vinaigrette to go with and I think that's really a must. At least for us.. this sammie is rich, kids. It definitely needs a salad or other light side with it. I had considered frying potatoes &amp; onions, making our dinner more breakfast-like, but am glad that I didn't. So who doesn't like a ham & cheese sammie, eh? I like them, they are O.K., not my favorite but I've eaten many in my day. Who hasn't? Feel about the same way? Kinda meh? Yeah well.. make this kicked up hot ham & cheese sandwich and I doubt you'll ever go back to the usual. We were both amazed at how good this was. Admittedly, the prosciutto wasn't the right ham. It was too salty, but that still didn't take away much from the sandwich in whole. And it was fun to eat a "gourmet" hot ham & cheese with a fork & knife! I suppose you could pick it up and eat it as you would any other sammie, but it'd be kinda messy.. but hey, if that's your thing, go for it. ;) I urge you all to go out and buy a good ham that's not too salty, a big chunk of gruyère or emmental (I'm sure Swiss would be just fine) and a dozen eggs and get to making this for your dinner this week - and then throw it into your rotation every once in a while. It's a bit of a splurge both in price and calories, but you won't be sorry after you take that first bite. Trust me. SO. FAKKIN. GOOD. Croque Monsieur or Madame Serves 4 For Bechamel sauce: 3 TBS. butter 1/4 c. all-purpose flour 3 c. whole milk (I used fat-free and it came out just fine) Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg Salt & white ground pepper to taste For the sandwiches: 8 slices high-quality bread. (the recipe called for "Pullman" loaf, I used French) sliced 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick. 12 oz. thinly sliced jambon de Paris (high quality wet-cured ham, not too salty) 10 oz. Gruyère cheese, coarsely grated 4 whole eggs (for the madame) Over low heat, in a small saucepan, melt butter then whisk in flour until blended. Continue to whisk while pouring in milk to avoid lumps. Continue to cook, stirring constantly until thickened. This should take about 10 minutes. (If you are only making enough for 2 the sauce thickened within 2 minutes) Once thickened, season with nutmeg, salt & pepper. (This is where I added a couple handfuls of grated gruyère and the smallest pinch of ground mustard) Take off heat, set aside. The recipe says you can make the bechamel sauce up to 24 hours early. Place plastic wrap directly on the sauce so it won't form a skin, then refrigerate. Gently reheat a few minutes before you are going to use it. Preheat the oven to 400º F. Place the 8 slices of bread in a single layer on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Spread the bechamel sauce evenly to the edges of all the slices (you may not need all of the bechamel). Divide ham between only 4 slices covered with bechamel, keeping the ham within 1/4 inch of the edges. Top all 8 slices with equal amounts of grated gruyère cheese, again spreading it evenly within 1/4 inch of the edges. Place the 4 slices with bechamel and cheese (cheese side up!) on top of the slices layered with ham. Bake until cheese topping is melted and golden brown about 10 to 15 minutes (it took about 20 minutes in my oven) To make the croque-madame, fry 4 eggs sunny-side up (I went with over easy, because egg slime is A VERY BAD THING) and place one on top of each sandwich. Sprinkle with salt & pepper and serve immediately. xoxo Kids! I don't know what the hell has possessed me, but I've baked. And not for a Daring Baker's challenge, either. I baked on my own. WTF? Here's what I'm thinking.. ya'll should run out and buy lots of bottled water, saltine crackers, canned goods and toilet paper (never be without toilet paper!!). Dig yourself an underground shelter in the back yard and prepare yourself for some kind of natural disaster. I don’t bake unless it’s a DB challenge! Something bad is surely going to happen! And bread! Lord almighty I NEVER bake bread on a whim or on my own - NEVER. This disaster is going to be a doozy – I’m tellin’ yas! Wait.. don’t go getting all panic stricken just yet. I still have my usually long ass story to tell. Come back. Sit down. Join me in a glass (or twelve) of your favorite alcoholic beverage.. believe me, it’ll calm those shaking hands. Or is it just my hands that are shaking? Whatev. Anyhoo, something made me finally bake THIS RECIPE again. Go look. Because if you don't go look you won't understand what a wonderment this baking adventure was. Seriously. GO. LOOK. Did I lie? Is that not the most frightening things you've ever seen? It's like science fiction and pornography combined. And I ate those bad boys. All 4 of them. In like a week. If even. It was the best damn cheesy bread I've ever had and at that juncture in my life I didn't think anything could be as good as Panera's Asiago bread . But those 4 cheesy baked monstrosities were phenomenal. I kept saying that I would make them again.. but baking is sooooooooo fakking stressful for me. The Baking Gods hate my ever-livin guts. They laugh at me at every occasion. They mock me at the drop of a hat. They sneer and point at me while whispering behind my back. I don't know what the fakk I ever did to piss them off, but I obviously did. And now, what? 2 years later? Something possesses me to make them again. I made the starter last Thursday night. I was unsure how far ahead you can make a starter, so I enlisted the advice of my bread baking guru , Mary. She told me I can make it a few days ahead, which eased some pressure as I knew I wanted to make it this weekend, but was unsure of the exact day. HAR! Yeah.. in other words - how long could I procrastinate before my started died and I chickened out? Gah. Well.. come to find out the Baking Gods were watching - AS PER FUCKING USUAL. You see, the recipe calls for instant yeast. I didn't even comprehend that.. I used active yeast. So after 15+ hours (I had to work on Friday), it hadn't gotten very bubbly and pretty much looked just like a wad of dough. Not good. So I got on the King Arthur website and with an expert. It was immediately pointed out that I used the wrong yeast. Duh. I thanked her and then realized… Baking Gods – 1 / Lisa – BIGFATFUCKINGZERO. I didn't have instant yeast, so I sweet talked my beloved Hubbs into running out to get me some. Bless his cotton socks. Soon I had the correct yeast and more bread flour. I started again - this time around 6 a.m. Saturday morning. I figured it’d be good to go around 2ish that afternoon, then I’d make the dough and allow it to rise until Sunday morning. Way longer than what’s called for, but I’ve read that if you let your dough rise for a long time, the better the flavor of the bread.. and hell, any excuse to actually put off baking it. Yeah, the memory of the smoke detector going off and black billowy smoke spewing from my oven the last time I made this bread was pretty damn strong. Well my powers of procrastination are pretty damn.. uhmm.. powerful. I managed to conveniently “forget” the starter on Saturday afternoon. And Saturday night. On Sunday morning I remembered it and said to myself, “Hey dipshit, you need to make the bread today.” And then I blocked it out again. I had plans with my girlie friends to go shopping at Trader Joe’s.. and I’ve been out of Tejava tea for a month. Nectar of the (non-baking) Gods, I tell ya! So my mind was conveniently “elsewhere”. :P When I got home Sunday afternoon, I put away the groceries, poured myself a big glass of tea and got the flour out. I was going to make the dough! Go me! Making the dough took roughly 5 minutes. Mmmm hmm… 5 whole fakking minutes of my time. A spare 5 minutes that I just couldn’t seem to find all day Saturday and most of Sunday. You see this is how my mind works. And believe me, I know I ain’t right. Knowing full well how delicious the bread would end up, I still did everything I could to drag my big fat feet in making it. It’s like I’m a glutton for my own punishment. What. The. Freeg? Before I went to bed Sunday night, I punched the dough down because obviously I wasn’t going to make the bread. Today was a rare morning.. I actually woke up after my husband. That happens maybe twice a year? And I’m usually sick.. but whatev, I woke up later and the first thing out of his mouth wasn’t the usual grumble-speak “mrn’ng” or even “is the princess FINALLY up?” it was, “My goodness, doesn’t that freshly baked bread smell delicious?” What an ass. This was his way of telling me that the dough had been sitting out far too long and if I was going to bake bread then I better shit or get off the pot. Visual there.. sorry. Moving along.. A lovely collage of basically the same photo of the mini loaves/buns.. -slurp- I finally made my bread today. FOUR days after making the first batch of starter. FOUR. I had made two batches of dough so that I could make the mini “loaves” and a couple regular sized loaves. This time I cut the mini loaves much thinner.. and they came out more like bun size, which was perfect. Smaller means that the insides can’t rise out from the base reminiscent of the alien bursting out of that guy’s chest. I didn’t make flaccid geoduck/penis this time. They turned out bakery beautiful! I was AMAZED. I know today is a holiday for us in the US, but uhmm.. is this also a holiday for the Baking Gods? Or did I just take so damn long that I fooled them into believing that I’d never actually bake the dough?? Either way.. it all turned out great! Even the regular sized loaves, which I was unsure of because I hadn’t attempted that last time. Today is a day to mark on the books. Today I BEAT THE SHITE out of the Baking Gods. Today I made myself proud. Today something horrible is going to happen.. so really now.. get off your asses and start digging up your back yard. You can thank me for the head’s up after it’s all over. ;) xoxo The 2010 February Daring Cooks challenge was hosted by Michele of Veggie Num Nums . Michele chose to challenge everyone to make mezze based on various recipes from Claudia Roden, Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Dugid. This month's Daring Cook's challenge brought a whole new culture into my life. I've never eaten ANYTHING Middle Eastern before, although my sister loves it and has been telling me for months that I need to try it. I have to admit, Middle Eastern fare, never really thrilled me because when I think of that kind of food, I think of beans. -shudder- Chickpeas, lentils, black beans.. all of those lil pasty tastin' legumes. If you're new to this here lil blog, then you might not know of my strong dislike of beans. Frankly, I'd rather eat live bees. ;) But I am happy to say that I was completely wrong, which is nothing new. :P Yes, Middle Eastern food does contain beans, but there is so much of a variety of other foods - I had no idea! I wanted my Mezze to be special, so I called upon my home girls. My G's, if you will. June, Blimey & Amy - 3 of my favorite people in alla world. As per usual, they were up for it and all agreed to find a Middle Eastern recipe to bring to the party. Yay! I decided to make a cold Lebanese carrot salad, green beans (one of the few that I'll eat) Lebanese style, Kalamata olive tapenade as well as the mandatory hummus and pita bread. June brought a delicious Tabouli and Amy brought a refreshing and really delicious cucumber Raita. Unfortunately, Blimey got sick so she couldn't join us, and we missed her tremendously. We piled everything onto the kitchen table and started eating immediately. SO GOOD! My absolute favorite was the green beans Lebanese style. Holy cow, I could eat that daily. I wouldn't even share much of the left overs with the gals because I HAD. TO. HAVE. IT. the next night with a roas
ed chicken. Delish! I really enjoyed the small bites of everything.. and liked to combine different dishes to see what went best with what. My favorite combo was a lil Kalamata tapenade on some pita followed with a lil dab of cucumber Raita. Salty with a nice tang. -slurp- As for cooking this feast - no problems really at all. I got a lil nervous when my pita didn't balloon up like Audax's and it didn't really brown up on top. The bottoms browned up nicely though. And although parts were flat and parts were bubbly it was really good pita. June was the resident Middle Eastern connoisseur and she said the pita was excellent and she loved the other dishes as well. Score! I know it was good food because I realized afterward that we had no meat and didn't even miss it! It wasn't consciously planned that way, but since it happened, I'm going to say we dedicated our vegetarian dinner to Michele. :D Eating this way is definitely fun - true party food. Next I want to do a Tapas night and then a dim sum night.. I'm looking forward! Michele, thanks so much for turning me on to this delicious food and showing me how easy it is to make pita bread! I'll definitely be making it again! You did an excellent job hosting! Love you! Check out all the rest of the amazing Mezze feasts from our Daring Cook troops ! Just seeing what they've uploaded to the forums makes me all kinds of hungry for Mezze all over again! ;) xoxo A few weeks ago, my friend Michele and I were talking about recipes and doughnuts came up, like they eventually always do if you're having a conversation with me. :P Ahh yes, I love me my doughnuts. But I won't let myself eat them very often. -sigh- I know how bad they are because of their deliciousness. Anything that tastes that good is definitely a heart attack or stroke disguised in fluffy goodness covered in powdery sugar or chocolate. Or maple. Or bacon. Or cinnamon sugar. Or whipped cream. Or just plain for those days when you're trying to eat healthy. ;) So we decided that we must make homemade donuts. This past Sunday was D-day. I went with Alton Brown's recipe . I was a little nervous because, yanno, Alton can bring in a lil too much science. But the recipe was straightforward, thank the baby Jebus. The only problems I ran into were bad timing and way too hot oil. The timing thing - you need to heat milk to melt the shortening. Then you have to wait until it cools to lukewarm because you'll be mixing it with the water/yeast mixture. Well the -first- time I did it, I started to heat my milk and immediately poured my yeast into the lukewarm water, not taking into account that after the milk melts the shortening it'll take some time for it to cool off enough to add it to the yeast. Doh! You wouldn't believe how fakkin long it takes for hot milk to cool the fug down. Jebus. My yeast/water mixture had already bubbled and was sitting on the bottom of my very cold metal Kitchenaid bowl. If you listened closely enough you could hear their itty bitty teeth chattering and their itsy bitsy knees knockin'. :( I was blowin' on the milk.. fanning it with a kitchen towel.. put it in the fridge for 10 minutes.. the bottom of the bowl wouldn't cool off. I mean this stuff was HOT. So finally, we (Hubbs was present) decided to put the damn bowl out in a snow drift. I mean, seriously. It's not like we were trying to cool off GALLONS of milk.. it was just a cup or so for crissakes, but it wouldn't cool down. And no, this had nothing to do with my desire to be eating warm, fluffy, mouth-wateringly, rings of yumminess. Much. 'kay well maybe it had a lot to do with my impatience over having to wait for the prize, but I tell you - that milk was volcano hot. Outside it went. :P Okay well what are two people to do while waiting on milk to cool? They get all caught up in Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl VI is what they do. We couldn't peel our eyes away from the cuteness if we tried. OHMYGOD. Chubby puppy bellies! Wagging puppy tails! Floppy puppy ears!!! Much more delicious than any doughnut! And when we finally did remember there was molten hot milk sitting in a snow drift on our back deck, this gal jumped up immediately, tripped over her dog, caught herself before completing a full face plant into the arm of the loveseat and then promptly tripped over the blanket she had been cuddled under while watching oodles of puppies attacking each other and stuffed footballs. That was more exercise than I've had in weeks. GAH. As you might have guessed, the shortening was no longer liquefied. It sat in greasy lumps in the ICE COLD milk. Mmm hmmm... Meanwhile.. my yeast had passed on to the great bread bakery in the sky. It was a pitiful scene. No bubbles. Just murky muck sitting on the bottom of the bowl. -sigh- So I cleaned up my lil yeasty dead soldiers, put the milk back on the burner until the shortening JUST started to melt. Waited 10 minutes and THEN brought yeast and lukewarm water back together again. After all of that, putting the dough together was a snap. The waiting was the hard part.. at one point I felt like standing in front of the bowl containing the dough ball and screaming "HURRY THE FAKK UP FOR CRISSAKES!! DOUGHNUTS! HUNGRY! NOM NOM NOM!!!" Once I had them shaped and rising the last time, I heated my oil in a wok. I knew it was kinda hot, but I didn't want a greasy doughnut, so I figured a little hotter than it called for would be a good thing. And it was. Although they came out a little darker than you'd see in a doughnut shop, they weren't burnt or greasy. They were light and fluffy and uber delish. I did a good job of refraining from putting a platter on the table, throwing my hair up into a ponytail, putting my hands behind my back and doing my best impression of a pig feeding in the trough. It was hard though. Delicious homemade doughnuts, still warm and covered in cinnamon sugar.. OH. MY. GOD. SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. It's super easy to make doughnuts and home and really the waiting isn't all that bad - 1.5 hours total rise time is all it calls for. You can make several varieties with one batch of dough and depending on size, you can get quite a few doughnuts. The only way I can describe the size of mine is they were the size of doughnuts you buy prepackaged in a grocery store.. like from Pepperidge Farms if anyone is familiar. I didn't have a doughnut cutter, nor even a round cutter. So I used a wine glass and to cut the middles out, I used the cap of a 2 liter bottle of soda. HAR! Worked like a charm! :) I used the scraps to make twists. We were going to fill some of them, but that didn't happen for whatever reason. I know these doughnuts freeze well too. Course I wouldn't know that from this experience. I packaged them in freezer bags and left on the counter overnight because it was too dark for photos after they came out of the oil. And after I took photos the next day, I put them back into the bags and then something else caught my attention.. Oh look! A chicken! That night they were pretty much stale. So eat 'em quick or freeze 'em soon! Go check out Michele's doughnuts! She filled hers with yummy stuff! :) xoxoxo Okay not really.. but he's the only winter Olympian that I know of. And frankly, I'm not even sure he's in the Olympics this year.. is he? What I do know is I like his long wavy red hair. But I probably shouldn't say that out loud as I'm most likely old enough to be his Aunt. -cough- Anyhoo.. as per usual, I'm a day late and a dollar short. And once again I feel foolish because of it. This month's Daring Baker challenge was a breeze and the results were muy deliciouso! Wait, that's Spanish.. what would the Canadians say? Uhmm.. 'kay.. well.. the results were KICK ASS! (that's more of what I'd say because I don't know what a Canuck would say. Canuck.. is that PC?) The January 2010 Daring Bakers’ challenge was hosted by Lauren of Celiac Teen . Lauren chose Gluten-Free Graham Wafers and Nanaimo Bars as the challenge for the month. The sources she based her recipe on are 101 Cookbooks and www.nanaimo.ca. Lauren is from Canada and these Nanaimo bars are her tribute to the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver, Canada. Here's a funny.. and he's probably going to kill me.. but I received an email this morning from my friend John who had to tell me that while he was making his dough for the graham crackers he noticed that it smelled like graham crackers. And then he said, "Really?? You think??." Yes Gorgeous, the dough DOES smell like graham crackers and after baked, they taste better than any graham cracker I've ever had. Addicting is the word. More like Graham Crack. I kept hearing, er, reading in the forums that other members couldn't stop eating the graham crackers and my friend Michele said the same thing - but I had NO. IDEA. HOW. GOOD. they really are. I was almost sad to have to crumble a bunch of them for the Nanaimo bars. Seriously. But I did.. and then I kinda veered off the traditional route and went down my own road. I've made Nanaimo bars before and they were delish, you'll get no argument from me there. But they were a leeetle sweet so this time I wanted to make all of the components but in different flavors - specifically flavors that aren't as sweet. I started with the graham cracker crust, and omitted the nuts as we can't eat them. I also ground the coconut to almost a powder because I had to hide it as Hubbs hates coconut with a passion. He'll eat stuff flavored with coconut but hates real coconut. Go figger. And I added a generous peench of cinnamon. What I didn't do was add the cocoa. This was entirely an accident. I was so intent on grinding down that coconut and getting it into the crust before he came back into the kitchen that I completely forgot the damn cocoa. I really did want a chocolate crust. Then I moved on to the filling, which is what I found too sweet in the traditional bars. I decided I wanted a blast of coffee with the tang of cheese. Ideally I was going to do mascarpone/butter cream frosting flavored with espresso powder. But I never got the chance to get the mascarpone, so I had to do with cream cheese. Basically I made cream cheese frosting sans most of the sugar - I probably used 1/3 of what a basic cream cheese frosting would call for, then thinned it a bit with a boat load of espresso powder stirred into a small amount of hot heavy whipping cream. I can't find the words to express how fakking good it turned out and I really can't wait to use it on a cake! For the topping, ya'll know me, right? I don't say no to any kind of chocolate unless it's white - which is not chocolate anyways. BUT just a few weeks ago, I made a pan of what is essentially buckeyes (the lil round gobs of delicious sweetened peanut butter dipped in chocolate), but instead of rolling out the peanut butter into balls, because I'm a lazy mofo, I just spread it into an 8 x 8 pan and poured the chocolate over it. After refrigerating the chocolate became hard (duh) and well.. after forcing myself to eat 3/4 of the pan myself, I was kinda over hard chocolate with something mooshey underneath. :P So I went with a basic ganache over the top of my coffee/cream cheese filling. As you can see in this picture, there is a bite taken. That is the one and only taste of these that I've had (so far) and it took every fiber of restraint in this chubby body of mine to stop there to rush into my office to write this post a day late. And keep in mind, I don't own very many restraint fibers. :P Holy mother of a chinless baboon, these bars are FANFARKINGTASTIC. They aren't nearly as sweet as the traditional Nanaimo bars, but they are definitely rich, and I'm confident that I can get over that. :P The cinnamon & coconut in the crust paired with the coffee and chocolate and the tang of the cream cheese is nothing if not heavenly. Lauren, thank you so much for choosing these recipes and for allowing us the creativity to choose different flavors. I just hope I can restrain myself until Saturday evening as I've promised these bars as dessert for friends who are coming over.. but then again if I just whip up another batch, who will be the wiser? ;) Pop on over HERE for the recipes for the grahams (gluten free and made with wheat flour versions) and the traditional Nanaimo bar recipes! xoxo Okay so I can't win. I either am stressing to get a Daring Kitchen challenge done at the last minute, or I get it done way early and then something happens where I can't get to my lil blog to post on the damn reveal date. WTF? The January 2010 Daring Cooks' challenge was hosted by Cuppy of Cuppylicious and she chose a delicious Thai-inspired recipe for Pork Satay from the book 1000 Recipes by Martha Day. Huge apologies to Cuppy - I feel as if I have failed our host(s) miserably when I'm late to get a post up.. this wasn't intentional! And now I am seriously pressed for time - but the good news is, there was no disaster this month, so I really don't have a long post full of expletives and "whoa is me" whining. ;) I made Chicken Satay using Cuppy's longer version marinade and it didn't even look remotely appetizing as I was transferring my chicken strips (breasts sliced into strips) from the bag of marinade to the broiling pan (grill was under 2 feet of snow..) all yellow and stuff. But I kept an open mind, Lord knows I've been happily surprised often in the past with these Daring Cooks challenges! I had made my peanut sauce earlier due to time constraints and was warming it up again, while the chicken was under the broiler, when it separated. I had a small pan of peanut solid and peanut oil. Ewww. I was very dismayed over it, but thanks to my experience of making buttercream 59 gajillion times, I decided not to panic and to just get out my trusty balloon whisk and start whisking. Luckily it all came together again - only now it was almost like peanut fudge, which isn't a bad thing - just something I wouldn't normally pair with chicken. ;) Thanks to the amazing support we receive on the private forums of the Daring Kitchen, my question of why it separated was answered by Robert of An Alaskan Cook's Exploration of Food and Technique - and he thought that I had too much heat going on. And he was most likely right, I did have the heat up pretty high now that I think of it. Stupid on my part. Again, I persevered and continued on with dinner, making a batch of Basmati rice to go with. Once it was all done, yeah it still didn't look that great. My chicken was even more yellow and my sauce was no longer sauce-y. At this point, I could have binned it all and declared it a disaster, but I was HUNGRY dammit. So I plated, called Hubbs to the kitchen and got a giggle from the expression on his face. He was not amused. He must have been hungry too. hehehe I decided to take my dinner into my office so I could watch a movie (and mainly because I wasn't in the mood to hear him bitch about how awful the food was). Surprisingly.. this dinner was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I cannot express how much I LURVED it! Suffice to say that it's been well over a week since I've made Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce and a day hasn't gone by that I haven't craved it. Unfortunately, Hubbs wasn't as impressed (most likely because he turns his nose up at any form of chicken. He'll eat it but not happily.) and that's the only reason I haven't cooked this dinner several times since my first taste. But my cravings will win soon - they ALWAYS do - and he'll just have to get over it. ;) I always thank our hosts at the end of my posts, but this time I really need to lay on the lurve. Cuppy jumped in when, at the last minute, our slated January host couldn't do it. Cuppy had NO TIME and yet she came up with a well written recipe and plan for all diets. This was a quick challenge, that was most gratefully received after the busy and hectic holidays and I now have a new favorite quick meal to throw together after a stressful day at work. And yes, this recipe has been "westernized" and is not an authentic Thai recipe, but it's delicious regardless. I seriously cannot wait to make it again! Thanks so much, Cuppy!! :) xoxo The December 2009 Daring Bakers’ challenge was brought to you by Anna of Very Small Anna and Y of Lemonpi . They chose to challenge Daring Bakers’ everywhere to bake and assemble a gingerbread house from s
 Don't call for the sake of calling Never try calling someone working for a company unless you know their full name. Chances that you are going to get through their receptionist are slim: This I learned some weeks ago when I tried to get hold of a marketing manager of a Swedish company based in Shanghai. The receptionist told me “he” (that later turned out to be a she!) was out and that she didn’t know what time “he’d” be back. I tried other people: -Somebody else working with marketing? -Not available. -Some Swedish person working there? -At a business trip. Would be back earliest in 2 months (!). -The manager!? -In a meeting all day. I soon realized it was useless. It didn’t matter who I asked for –even the cleaning lady was completely unavailable since I didn’t know her last name. I had two other people calling trying the same thing before we all gave up and decided to call the head office in Sweden. Via them (because there, surprise, surprise, you can actually talk to people when you call!) we got the name of someone working in Beijing, and via the Beijing woman, we finally got the name of the marketing manager in Shanghai. Next time I called I got through straight away. And when I went for a meeting there one day later, I miraculously met several Swedes working away at their desks: - Oh, recently got back from your trip?! I inquired.  -Trip? They said, looking at me as if I was from another planet.  In other words: don’t try calling someone working over here unless you know their name. The receptionists can be quite tough, working like a spam filter and only letting through those that are “inside enough” to know who’s doing what. I'm going far away from this kind of scene... Finally, we booked a trip to somewhere... that is totally random! I swear, you guys are going to think I'm odd who's travelling to this particular place at this time of the year. It's not really the "ideal" place to visit, however, I'm always keen on seeing something completely new, hence why I picked it. Can tell you this much -there will be a lot of nature and hopefully also some pretty awesome (but different) food! Not to mention some severe temperature differences between night and day....! Anyone who can guess where I'm headed?  UPDATE: for those that cannot be bothered to read the comments, some of you guessed right. I'm off to Inner Mongolia! Most Wanted Joint I spent Saturday in Suzhou –packing and cleaning. We are definitely staying in China for some time still, but our new Shanghai flat is much smaller than the one we had in Suzhou –so a lot of stuff has to go. After a Saturday full of throwing away stuff we felt fed up with being locked inside and got ready to take the 5.30pm train to Shanghai. We walked out on our yard, carrying large bags, and being quite in a hurry when we saw a group of four Chinese -3 women and one man, with so much hair wax in his hair that it looked like glue- stepping out of a car. - Heeeeey! Laowai, laowai! The wax-man yelled, and we, thinking it was just the ordinary “hello laowai” moment, continued walking without paying them any attention. ..That was until I suddenly heard the wax man literally call for us. - Please wait laowai, I have a question! We turned around, facing the wax man and three older ladies. - You live in that building over there right? The man said, pointing at our building. -Yes. -And you are moving out very soon? -Yes. -That’s what I thought. So today I brought this 3 ladies to show them your flat! He proudly gestured to three small ladies at his right side. - Ehhh… -Can we go and see it now!? One lady asked. - Er, we are going to Shanghai, I said, nodding towards my large shoulder bag. - Ah OK … said the man. But can’t you show us the flat before you go? -We don’t have time! We are catching the train. -Oh… no time…. The wax man sounded seriously disappointed. - What time is your train , one of the women said. I am sure you have time to show us the flat before that. -The train is leaving quite soon, we have to go now actually, I said. We don’t have time to show you our flat (“How about calling first?!” I wanted to screem). -That is a shame, the wax man said, looking at us as if we were enemies. So when will you be back then?! (Just as if we had broken a non-existent appointment?!) - Well… we are… ah, why don’t you just call me next time?! My bf said.  - Ah.. OK. You want me to call you. I understand, the wax man said. -A re you sure you don’t have time to show us the flat? One of the ladies urged. You will still make your train. It’s fast to get to the train station from here! They all smiled, and one of them attempted to pull my sleeve. I gave her a dark look. Enough with the bull-sh-t. And we left. Just imagine that, huh? You take three ladies on a house hunt on a Saturday afternoon, however, you forget to inform the current tenants, so instead you jump on the first laowais you see on a parking lot?! (our living area is huge, there are at least 40 buildings in there!). Fortunately they are the “right ones.” Then you try and convince them to show you their flat even though you know they’ll miss their train if they linger?! If that’s not random I don’t know what is?! One would think this was a serious aerobic class in full throttle. And I guess it was. But not for everyone: Apparently, the aerobic class, with bom-ba-da-bom-tunes blasting from the speakers, was also a perfect place for reading a book! Who would have guessed?! Not me, anyway.  When I say I need a run, I mean it I’ve had a bit of a rough week, with a lot of stuff going on, making my mood anything but stable. Yesterday I decided that no matter how much work there was on my desk by the end of the day, I would still hit the gym in order to burn some energy. I kept my promise… but just as I was about to leave for the gym a strange feeling hit me.. Did I really pack all my training clothes? I decided to have a look, and very well. I had packed all my training clothes, except for a sport’s bra. There’s no way (on earth) that I will hit a gym wearing a normal bra, so the remaining question was: could I bother going home, picking up a sport’s bra, and then head back to the gym? (It’s definitely not on the way, rather, I live in the opposite direction) However, after a moment of mental self-consulting, I decided that I very well could. So I went home, found what I needed, spent extra time on a crammed metro and arrived at the gym one hout later than planned, but hyped about the thought of hitting the treadmill. I had dinner plans at 8pm, so I went over to the reception and asked to “rent” a towel a 5 kuai so that I could shower and head out straight after my workout. Imagine my surprise when the (RUDE!) guy behind the desk said: -No towels today. If it would have been any other day I might have shrugged my shoulders and left, slightly annoyed. This particular day, however, his words made me see red. -That’s IMPOSSIBLE! That’s not OKAY! I need a towel. I NEED TO WORK OUT! (again, I normally don’t yell at people, but…) - Well sorry, we don’t have any. -No, this is not okay. You always have towels. If you suddenly decide not to have towels you need to inform your customers in advance so that we can bring some ourselves! I didn’t bring a towel today just because I thought I could “rent” one from here! -Well… -Well you have to find me a towel. I am not leaving. I need a towel otherwise I cannot workout. -Eh.. maybe you should speak to the manager? -Yeah, where is he or she? -Eh… he will come in 3 min. I waited for 3 minutes, feeling angrier by the minute. I simply refused to just go home.  The reception guy was really annoying: - I know this situation is really annoying… (he said it in a sarcastic way). - VERY. -Why don’t you go and workout first, have a shower and THEN come and see if we have found you a towel? -WHAT?! How am I going to shower without a towel?! ( I wanted to say "do you want me to walk out naked and ask if you have now found me a towel?!" but I don't know the Chinese word for naked, so I left it like that) (I guess his suggestion here was: "why don’t you do like all the other girls at this gym and dry yourself off with the hairdryer once you come out of the shower"). Then, 2 girls suddenly arrived (manager?). The reception guy told the girls they needed to find “this laowai” (pointing at me) a towel. - There are no towels , the girls said. - There HAVE to be towels! I know there are, somewhere! I don’t care what kind, you just have to find me a towel! -But there are no! -Please. Try! The girls sighed, rolled her eyes and went away, only to come back 30 seconds later…. Carrying a LARGE, WHITE, TOWEL! - Oh, I found one. Oh my, oh my. At that point, however, I was too relieved to continue bitching about their lousy attitude towards problem solving, I simply accepted the towel and went to the ladies changing room. Once at the gym all the treadmills were busy. However, I didn’t even consider the thought of giving up this workout, or settling for anything else but running. I simply located a girl who was walking along to a clock ticking down (she only had 4 min left), and I was rude enough to stand behind her and wait for her to finish and get off. A number of people realized what I was doing. Some laughed, some pointed, and some tried to sneak in between when they realized the girl would be done soon! But I was faster and once I got up there I enjoyed the best 7km run I’ve done in ages… ahhhh. Relieeeeeef! Once I made that 8pm dinner I felt rather proud of myself and my  nagging-attitude. If there’s a will there’s a way –this appeals to most of the “impossible to solve ”-situations in China. It's not as if I have not been told that I "cannot run" before...  A captured metro moment from 2007 Fellow metro-commuters in Shanghai, have you noticed lately (at least during the morning rush) that more and more people nowadays stand on the right hand side of escalators?! That way, it’s almost as efficient ( Hold your horses, I said almost ) as the London underground system (where I believe you stand to the left, but I might be wrong?) where you literally get walked over if you accidently stand on the “walking hand side” of the escalator. Of course, there are still a few cases of people (OK, not just a few, more like… some millions) standing on the left hand side when you come walking, but with a gentle push/tap on the shoulder, a good 90% immediately move to the side to let you through. Good stuff.  Unfortunately not all people are as friendly/helpful. I’ve had cases where I’ve gently tapped the other person’s shoulder (in 98% of the cases it's been middle-aged Chinese men), and said something like “不好意思（bu haoyisi= pardon me)” indicating I want to be let through. But do they move? Oh no?! In one case, the man turned around, looked at me, and stood like a brick of stone on his spot, refusing to even let me squeeze between him and that person to the right. (When he started pushing me back with violence I decided to give up). Still, a great improvement from previous years, so Shanghai metro –I have hope! One thing I still wish people could relax a little bit about is getting on/off the metro. The other day we had a work-dinner after work, and me and a few colleagues caught the metro just one stop to get to the restaurant. We were a group of five, and since the metro was quite full we stood just at the door. I immediately felt the push from behind, some guy that tried to squeeze in between us to stand JUST at the door, so I turned around and told him that we too were getting off at the next station. He looked like he understood, and for a short second he stood back… until something must have hit him (maybe that eagerness to STAND at the DOOR) so he still decided to elbow his way through our little group and catch the spot JUST at the door. (Guess he’d been taught never to trust laowais?). The funniest cases are still all those people that push like mad in the metro, RUN off the metro as if their houses were on fire, and then, finally, when they get to the escalator –they just stand there, rather than continuing moving upwards. Speaking off the metro –Shanghai’s new metro system (with new lines and plenty of new stations) is simply G-R-E-A-T N-E-W-S-! I’m loving every little bit of it, especially line 7 that’s now connected to Line 1’s Changshu Lu. Simply great. Me and my significant other are planning a metro-exploring weekend someday in April/May (when you don’t freeze your fingers off every time you step out the door) where we are going to spend 2 days catching all new lines, getting off at stops we’ve never heard off before and explore the surrounding. We used to do this at the magazine where I worked back in 2007, and it's not as bad as it sounds... you actually get to see quite a lot of new stuff. I promise to report back to you afterwards. Whatever you do -as a girl- only pay attention to the guys Sometimes, China’s just so funny. While western guys can receive an unlimited amount of compliments over here (from men as well as from women), there’s a clear line when it comes to women. The other day I went shopping with four Chinese girlfriends. We are not super close, but have known each other for some years still. They are all a bit younger than me, and especially one of them (her name is Luna) really likes me and the fact that I’m tall, blonde, and big-nosed. We went into some shops and were all trying on clothes. I had one of those good (and rare) days when everything fits, and my dear friend Luna simply would not hold back on the compliments: -Ah, Jonna, you look so great in everything you try on today! -That’s perfect on you! -You’ve got a great figure! I was blushing/”nail-nali-ing”/”bu gandang-ing”/and so on (yeah, accepting a compliment is simply not my thing, especially not here in China) until one of the other Chinese girls decided she’d had enough: - What’s the matter with you Luna, the way you speak to Jonna one would think you have a crush on her?! -Come on… I’m just saying she looks good in this dress. -No you’re not. I think you like her.  -Yeah, I think you do! Another one filled in. You've been speaking to her as if you like her all day long! (Yikes. Uncomfortable situation number ONE. Chinese girls are fighting over if one of them has a crush on me or not?! And all she did was paying me some compliments?) -I don’t, come on. -Well, so how come you don’t have a boyfriend. -I have not found one I like. -Well maybe you like girls. Maybe you have a big problem… -Hahhaha, well well, shall we all go for lunch?! (I decided it was time to step in and change the subject -and what better way to do so than distract them with lunch?). However, the conversations continued over the food when Luna asked me if I wanted to try her salmon pasta (we were having a Wagas lunch). -Seeeeeeeeee….. you totally like her!!! You've got a problem! You like girls! Both me and Luna sighed. Man! There’s no way to get a compliment over here, is there? What a weekend! Since I’ve now been living in Shanghai for 2 months, we decided that it was time to throw a small housewarming party. Now, housewarming parties are not really a unique kind, so in order to do something different we decided to have a theme at our party, namely “bad taste.” Shopping proved to be the best part of it all. We headed straight to the small shops on Fuxing Lu where I tried on everything from flower-power pants to zebra meets leopard dresses. I eventually settled for a skintight golden/leopard shirt, a high-waist black/gold skirt, and a silver/snakeskin jacket that was way too small for me. All in all: I looked like jungle girl going disco. My bf picked his outfit from another shop. We knew straight away that it was going to be fun, because the moment we walked in, the sale’s girl went ballistic. - OH MY GOSH!!! You are the most handsome man I have ever seen! She gushed to my boyfriend. She followed him around, stroking his arms, giggling and picking out stuff for him to try. She had no idea that we were going for something rather tacky (and that we therefore actually kind of liked the stuff she picked), and said “yeeeeeeees!” and “perfect ” to every single shiny garment that he agreed on trying on. In the end he went for a gray, silver sequence suit jacket, a check-patterned hat, a tight t-shirt and some go
den jewellery chains. He looked like a complete yuppie and the sale’s girl looked like she was going to pass out on the spot: - Oh my Gosh! You look SO GOOD!! (We laughed so hard we didn’t know what to do!). While he was paying, the sale’s girl turned to me: - Is he your boyfriend? -Yes. -Oh my GOSH! You are so lucky! SO LUCKY! I admire you! -He’s indeed very popular in China. -Well, he is the most handsome man I have seen! And you…..! You too are very …. (long look at me) special! -Special? -Yes, in fact. I like the both of you! -That’s nice of you to say. -I love your nose! -My nose? (small moment of hesitation). -It’s the biggest and most beautiful nose I have ever seen! (I had to bite my lip not to have an uncontrolled laugh fit) -Ehum, right. Eh… thanks! She waved goodbye when we left, opening the door and yelling: - Come back soon! You are my favourite laowai couple!!! After us. We were high on laughter as we hit the streets. The party itself was a blast, despite an insane number of strange cancellations from our friends: 2 girls confessed they were preggers and couldn’t make it, one guy confessed his girlfriend was preggers and that he was going to Korea to get married (!), one girl had to work, another one thought it was raining too hard outside (…), and then one guy broke his arm in an ice-hockey game the night before?! Hahaha! We still managed to pull a crowd, however, and ended up having a great time. People had really made an effort and one guy actually showed up in a dinosaur costume. My boyfriend was a hit in his pimp-outfit, meanwhile my Chinese girlfriends expressed their disappointment in me: -Jonna, you actually look good in those clothes. I would totally wear that on a night out!! Go out as the golden meets silver jungle-disco girl?! (well I shouldn’t say too much –because that’s exactly what I did some drinks later). I guess our taste levels are different! Bad taste party calls for bad taste-snacks: we picked these up at our local bakery Mmmm, green bean bun anyone?! 
Just as the SNL offshoot , Waynes's World , brought out Freddie Mercury and Queen freshly remastered for Generation Next to make their own, so too does Hotel Chevalier , the thirteen minute outtake and/or prequel from from Wes Anderson's new movie , The Darjeeling Limited , bring us back to 1969 and Peter Sarstedt 's London megahit of that year, Where Do You Go To My Lovely ? with digitized and remastered immediacy Peter Sarstedt was born in Delhi, and spent his infancy in Kurseong at the foot of the Himalayas, at a tea garden where his father worked, and was therefore a real Indian-Anglo-Indian, obviously more privileged than the folks depicted in Bow Barracks Forever -- since his parents chose to leave for England in 1954, a few years into Independence, like other Anglo-Indians who believed the end of the British Empire would bring them harm and left in numbers for Australia and Canada as well as England through the sixties-- but they really were of Indian blood nevertheless. Wes Anderson must have learned about this while making The Darjeeling Limited , because it was a hidden factoid in 1969 that would have earned Sarstedt wild fans in India, but at the expense of his following in England. It only surfaces now , when India is on a roll and all that doesn't matter so much any more, but is still not seen on his own web site. It's easy to see in these less hairy days that he is Indian, and I wonder how acknowledging that will play out. In 1969. of course, I had no idea Peter Sarstedt was Anglo-Indian, and would have counted him less hip and more Cliff Richard if I had. But I was struck then, no doubt like everyone else, by his crisp and easy delivery of the franglais back and forth lyrics, the clarity evident even through the fuzzy recordings of the day. I had no idea who Zizi Jeanmaire was, nor how to spell her name, nor even for that matter who her husband, the great choreographer Roland Petit was, but I had heard Sacha Distel 's cover of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head, did know that Karīm al-Hussaynī, Aga Khan IV , was gorgeous as well as being the astonishingly wealthy leader of all Shia Muslims, that the Dowager Begum Aga Khan always wore saris, and last, but by no means least, that it was as cool to wear Balmain as to keep your Rolling Stones records at a swank address, nothing to do with the Beatles, much as one might love them. Hotel Chevalier is famously available for free download at the iTunes Store , and so represents new and adventurous thinking in movie marketing as well as being a vehicle for reintroducing a worthy megahit of the 60's. As it happens, I went to the first ever, high-octane SAMMA conference this weekend, and Nusrat Durrani , SVP at MTV Networks, was one of the stellar presenters at the dinner reception, along with Aasif Mandvi . After dinner and outstanding performances , during which Nusrat Durrani showed a pastiche of his clips from the New York Marathon set to Pink Floyd's Breathe , I couldn't resist asking him if he had added Pink Floyd because they had been signed by Bhaskar Menon . He said no, he just likes them. But it turned out he hadn't heard about Peter Sarstedt being Indian-- so I hope something will come of that, because in these times, it's well to celebrate another Desi, in disguise for too long. an excerpt from Roland Petit's Le_jeune_homme_et_la_mort I missed the afternoon per- formance at the National Museum of the American Indian , but in the evening. I saw the most magnificent production of hula I have ever seen. The San Francisco dance company, Nā Lei Hulu I Ka Wēkiu , delighted a huge audience at Damrosch Park in Lincoln Center. I'll mostly let Lin Cariffe 's pictures of other performances of the same works speak for themselves. Kumu Patrick Makuakāne is such a fabulous presenter as well as a mesmerizing choreographer that he brings the audience right into the show while the show itself plays sensuality, thought and feeling with equal command and force. Lihau Hannahs and Kellen Paik provided highly evocative live music for the spectacular production, with thirty-two magnificently costumed dancers, who mixed presentations of traditional legends and tributes with two pieces of piercing satire and several touching, graceful modern pieces, including two set to Annie Lenox and Cyndi Lauper's most wistful songs, a brilliant capture of Peggy Lee's Fever , and a somehow heartrending interpretation of Tony Bennet's version of I Left My Heart in San Franscisco , with its illustrative gestures for "little cable cars" and "halfway to the stars"-- among other phrases -- casually revealing quite exactly what hula is about. A man seated in the row behind me shouted out frantically that he couldn't see, and at least twenty people turned around to shush him, pleading with him not to spoil it for everyone, so swept up was the audience with the gentle but powerful grace and great wit of the show. Antonioni's "achingly hip" Blow-Up FASHION SHOOT VERUSCHKA YARDBIRDS JANE BIRKIN TENNIS TRAILER (VANESSA REDGRAVE) Obits: BBC New York Daily News Al Jazeera The Montreal Gazette timesonline Indian Express Telegraph. UK Xinhua.net Yesterday, after dropping off Bear at JFK -- and being totally unaware that the Virgin Atlantic plane she had boarded was slated to stall on the tarmac for four hours, waiting for that evening's series of short storms to pass, and then take off without most of the food on the menu for passengers on the flight to London--I drove around aimlessly for a while, like anyone deprived of their young might, and decided to check in at the proudly independent Art Space still known as Galapagos . There, the twenty-and-now-early-thirty-somethings still milled and jostled, partying hard without ever lighting a cigarette, because, as Director Robert Elmes has correctly said, "We have our whole lives to live and that is terribly important." The reflecting pool at the entrance is limpid and surprising as ever, but as Galapagos has prospered, it will be moving quite soon from Williamsburg to DUMBO. I considered Lillian Godchaux's Solstice VII, which was going on inside the storied Back Room, and had been described by Lillian herself as "A night of LSD and Native American freak-out driven folk and SF-based soary acid folk in hither, wildering, and bewonderment of this great Solstice VII of the New Water/Matter Era." But I was curious about AVAAZ, the act scheduled to appear on the Main Stage, so I missed Almaden , Zachary Cale and Feral Cat . Instead, I spent the same $7 and one extra $ on two under- priced drinks at the candle-lit bar, especially to watch some of the members of AVAAZ (not to be confused with Avaaz.org ) setting up their fast-rising electroGLOBALdiscotek . T aking in their sleek looks, I wondered if they all had gone to MIT and now have day jobs at investment banks-- not that there's anything wrong with that. The best version of Sea had just opened down the street when I first saw Galapagos . I had gone to N Sixth Street back then entirely because Dave Eggers and McSweeney's held their first and earliest New York events in the now fabled Back Room, while they were reinventing fiction and food , hilarity and social awareness all at the same time. They turned writing into performance art as well -- right there at Galapagos, where I recall a gentleman in his nineties telling a tale of death and playground slides to the sound of helpless yet respectfully muffled laughter-- and n ow they need our help getting past their distributor Publisher's Group West's bankruptcy, by reason of which they are suddenly out $130K in one fell swoop. Say it isn't so... They are making a valiant effort with their online sales of all manner of items McSweeney and also with their "Heartbreaking eBay Auction of Staggering Audacity "... I pondered this tale of swinging through the ages by a length of tooth floss, and drank two drinks one after another as images of something like starlight played on the blue velvet curtains. These were soon drawn back for the laser light show streamed through whirling stencils in many-colored beams by dimmSummer , and young Pat Miscellane ous , bare-chested in chinos and a full dress, full length Cheyenne headpiece started rapping through the hai-chai remix that DJ Boo (aka Juggaknots) and I believe Bollygirl DK also had started up together. This was with and sometimes without a duet from--? Samera? Reena?. Then came DJ impala's entr'acte, and she played September , Billie Jean , Kiss , and just a few minutes of the long version of Marvin Gaye's Gotta Give it Up , but stopped while people had just started moving to this party-song-to-end-all-party-songs, to move on to Patti Labelle's original version of Lady Marmalade . How long ago it seems and yet not so far away at all. Mean while, silhouettes danced on the once again starlit velvet curtains, and cellphones flashed as taking pictures became general. Then came all-Desi recently schooled Bamboo Shoots , who are a really good, very special band that somehow brings the lead, rhythm and bass guitar plus drums format into the present moment. They were reviewed on Sepia Mutiny and played on Conan . Strangely, it was the Cold War era movie playing on the screen behind them that distracted, and because I'm not of the three screen generation, I spent at least fifteen minutes growing older trying to figure out who was who in black and white in Juliet of the Spirits . And then I had to go home while the band played on... and go to sleep, missing Butterthief and Suspicious Brown... The movie's called Evening , and if there's only one film that people who think too much and feel quite a lot and like to be slightly but deeply scared should see this summer, this is it. AL invited me to the Walter Reade Theater preview, where Susan Minot and Michael Cunningham showed up after the screening to discuss their experience in co-writing the screenplay adapted from the book with Kent Jones, the man with a light touch from the Film Society of Lincoln Center . Throughout the screening, I wondered about the marvelous filter effects on the dream sequences-- how they came on so wonderfully strong and obvious, then tapered off so gradually through the course of the story. Were they in the lens or a part of the editing? Faces were so closely imaged at the start of the story, and with so much particularity, that their natural asymmetry led the eye beyond conven- tional judgments about beauty, although every actor was stunning by any measure. One had to look afresh at already famous faces, that then grew familiar very quickly in these new forms. The casting is as superb as the cast. Of course, but of course, Glenn Close was Meryl Streep's mother in another life! Speaking of measurements, Vanessa Redgrave's acting must be measured by the frame, not by seconds. That's how close up the view becomes in this unsentimental yet touching study of two deaths in played out counterpoint. While Redgrave certainly carries it, all the others absolutely rise to the occasion. Having seen and heard my own grandmother apparently having good time at a fair number of parties on her near-deathbed, I found that this tale resonated with me, and the telling of it, its production, seemed to create a convincing experience of the swing between over- whelming wooziness and diamond hard clarity in the course of that personal time travel and that wandering out of body that heralds a slow death. Drawing away, the big picture of the society that provides the setting for this surprising story is delivered au point as well. While the circumstances of the wealthy family seems casually depicted, there is an uncanny conveyance of how things are proportioned for the rich. The wedding is generously informal and correct, not ostentatious, and the bride's dress is not overly grand. This is how it has to be, in a summer setting among people who enjoy extreme cleanliness, rely on slightly stodgy design, established standards of comfort, consuming both hand made and manu- factured goods of quality, and who take proper care of inherited objects as a matter of course. Yet there is also a clear sense of the perilous crowding and living cheek by jowl that imprisons the rich or aristocratic or patrician. Their circles must always be suffocatingly small, the more so the richer or better-established they are, and marriage and even preferred forms of adultery must occur within that small closed circle. The comedy of homosexuality in these narrow straits raises its suggestive head several times in the film. Sometimes it happens mistakenly, as when the mother of the bride happens upon her daughter sharing her wedding morning jitters with her college friend and bridesmaid who has crept under the covers. Pshaw! Sometimes it arises unawares, but for real, as when that same bride's mother snatches away her son from his partner during a playful jitterbug for a masterfully bone-chilling rhumba, purposefully extinguishing any possibility of his attachment to another woman. Ouch! These people are not incorrectly depicted as being stifled or inhibited, though. There is nothing in recent film to compare with Glen Close's raw howl over Buddy's sudden young death. There is faerie magic in the woods, but also there are different ways of seeing and treating a small cliff or those same woods, either as the border area between manicured grounds and Vast, Unknown, Dangerous Nature, or simply as perfectly familiar bits of the family's property. Playing off the difference in perspectives in a practical joke provides a bit of class-conflict that erupts into rage. Alcohol always plays a leading role in Susan Minot's books. In making Buddy a far more central figure in the film than he is in the book, Michael Cunningham ties this story closer to the rest of Susan Minot's work. The two writers, live four blocks apart in NYC but quite naturally met at a wedding in Nairobi soon after SM had recovered the rights to her book after an earlier attempt to turn it into a movie. Despite their close collaboration (SM said the collaborative process with MC had been like a master class in screenwriting), they differed on several points. For instance, MC believes a book is always a work in progress, the print capturing only a moment in the process, whereas SM says a printed volume in your hand is a clear indication of completion and enables the writer to let it go. MC said that film cannot capture an inner life as well a a book, but SM pointed out that one's inner life occurs in images, not words. But then, they spoke of shared delights in the making of the film, like watching Meryl Streep and Vanessa Redgrave on a monitor outside the house, and being amazed to see them step into character and switch it on,, discarding their natural selves in a flash. They talked about filming at a Newport house of that genre known as a "cottage" that belongs to the Cushing family, rather than in Maine, as in the book, which would have proven overwhelmingly expensive to produce. They concurred on the problem of turning an entire book into a movie, where films are really short stories, and the more sympathetic form for adapting a novel into image format is a television series. MC spoke fondly of squabbling with cinematographer and director Lajos Koltai over lines about which he had second thoughts, but that Koltai wanted to keep. SM spoke about about Eileen Atkins having trouble with the cadence of the lines until SM explained that the nurse was Irish. They both spoke of Hugh Dancy's out of period long hair, and that Lajos Koltai had predicted that critics would be all about his hair. We shall see. I was walking down 82nd Street day before yesteday, late in the afternoon, and realized that I had missed this year's Kips Bay Show House , which was being dismantled. Volunteering there had been one of my favorite "rites" of Spring for longer than I care to admit, but it's been more than seven years since I turned my attention to another event that raises funds for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club. The Show House I missed was hosted by the brilliant Janna Bullock and RIGroup . This was a very different undertaking from what it once was, when I was one of a band of perhaps twenty young women who took turns watching the rooms under the auspices of the original Show House Committee. The 
ommittee never changed from year to year, but were always there from dawn till dusk, in Chanel suits and ropes of pearls, fresh as proverbial daisies, and well into their seventies-- or so it seemed to me. The air was always scented with Rigaud candles and flowers, which competed with paint and varnish that was not yet cured. There were fads for peonies one year, orchids the next, and air plants another. One had to know what the antiques and paint finishes were, to explain them to visitors, and and make sure nobody fainted from climbing the stairs, as all the terrible things that can happen on elevators weren't covered in the insurance contracts. Once, Mrs. Mazzola decided to climb to the top and work her way down, and had to sit down at the top floor landing, which called for procedures reserved for extreme emergencies, in terms of the arrangements of those days. Luckily, a Chinese garden stool came in handy until a proper chair could be brought. Climbing the beautiful staircases two and three steps at a time was a special treat for me, and the main reason I always went back. I was new to New York, and missed staircases, especially those massive marble ones with low risers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century houses of my hometown, Calcutta , on which one could jump about and play games. Between chasing up and down these newer but equally generous staircases, I enjoyed the fact that the visitors were colorful, international, dressed up, and wore great shoes. My first happy moment of extra responsibility came one year in the first and grandest house, which was on 66th Street and belonged at the time to Imelda Marcos, who lent it every year for the Show House. In the main drawing room situated on the second floor, as in a piano nobile, Robert Metzger had set up an early multi-channel music system around the edges of the room which featured a lush, over-the-top eighties version of period decor, with plenty of silk damask and passementerie, the console being cleverly tucked away, iirc, in cabinet with Boulle marquetry or similar. I was required to stand by a massive flower arrangement on a round table in the center of the room under a magnificent Russian chandelier, smile at visitors and explain the rug, and I noticed that both speakers deployed to the west were playing the same channel, as were the ones to the east. To my enormous delight, RM allowed me to pull out the console after the House closed for the day, fiddle with the wiring and fix it. That would never be done today, as the firms who do the sound would, first of all, never make that kind of mistake, and the House would certainly never allow a volunteer to touch the wiring. A few years later, at the first Show House at 603 Park, also the last chaired by the legendary Rella MacDougall , I got to be her right hand gal at the entrance, where she handled tickets herself every day, transforming that job into a subtle performance that required her great wit. That year, the pantry, with its green-shaded light, big silver safe and humongous ancient icebox, was just cleaned up, because the idea was still only to present a decorated house, and the pantry was a perfect relic. One day, during that run, Mrs. MacDougall was hurrying to the Show House when a bag lady. as we called them then, stopped her to ask for help. Rella, being as warm-hearted as she was elegant, asked what she could do for her. The bag lady said, "Could you hold up this mirror for me?"and while Rella did that, the bag lady rummaged about her shopping bag, drew out and carefully put on a set of big false lashes. The house at 603 Park is one room deep but quite wide, with a long, long Park Avenue facade, and commensurate taxes, so it stayed on the market for a long time, to become the default Show House for Kips Bay and other causes for some years. Thierry Dèspont created a memorable decor in the paneled room there, but I can't remember whether it was for Kips Bay or the American Hospital in Paris. Although pictures of rooms from recent years are available online now, rooms that came before live only in one's memories and in the old journals-- a stack of which were lost to me in a heist upstate, in which I lost about a thousand books as well. What remains in my head: Mark Hampton's cream, white and sisal drawing room on 66th Street, with the bureau plat placed like a sofa table, in which all the fine Georgian mahogany became beautifully abstracted; The grand yet hilarious dining room that Ruben de Saavedra created at 62nd Street, where the fabric hung walls were drawn aside at mirrored intervals, for busts of laughing moors to peek out; Richard Ridge's almost completely lavender bedroom, which a band of his friends left in a group, all crying out, "Nurse!"; the narrow room at 1 East 94th Street that J. Allen Murphy dressed in yellow and Benarasi gold brocade, including an unraveled paghri as a pelmet, hung with Mughal lanterns, which he dedicated to the Raj Mata of Jaipur. She came to look, and I was embarrassed to see her at Doubles while I was still wearing a dress from volunteering (so un-Indian and deeply frowned upon then, though pants were fine); Richard Ridge's dining room in which the Romney had been cleaned to within a micron of its life; the large bedroom that John Saladino turned into a frescoed bathroom with a brass punkhah, so insulted was he not to have gotten a drawing room, according to my friend who used to work for him. Recent memorable rooms include Odile de Schietere's Venetian drawing room with furniture from Ferrières , Michael Simon's dix-huitième in black, the cleanest stable in creation by Andrew Tedesco , Larry Laslo's black bedroom where the black Baccarat chandelier made its New York début,... Diantha Nype was another reason I was there. Diantha had left Bryn Mawr to get married, which is like leaving Hogwarts to become a muggle, but then she out-Mawr-ed everybody by inventing the Show House-- it really was her idea to start with, although this will remain forever unsung, because it's totally not the credo to claim this kind of credit, considering how many other people have worked long and hard to make it happen. Nevertheless, start it she did, and so all show houses that exist, sprouting across the nation every spring and fall -- to Diantha we owe this most excellent concept. Of all the original Committee, it was she who was always second in command to Rella, she who addressed the robbery and she who created the public image of the Show House, as it is, was and ever shall be. Anyway, having missed the new Show House, and missing the brio of the old days, it was a very happy touch of deja vue to see what Matthew Sudock of M Design has done at David Burke & Donatella , where I met C for lunch. The mix of Hicks in carpet and screens, with creamy walls, plain mirrors, backlit red dry arrangement, large and loopy chandeliers, cheery cherry leather seating and gigantic bouquets of red-and white striped trumpet lilies , all scaled for a nice tall New York brownstone, reminded me of the panache, the hint of improv and inventive flair of the old days. The food is great , and playful too, and the tuna and salmon tartare not to be missed English-speaking people who are deaf to aspirates and aspirated consonants in Indian languages can't say ghee , and tend to produce incorrect spellings like Ghandi and Dehli. Because of this speech impediment, the word sipahi , meaning soldier in Persian and Urdu, became sepoy for the British, who gave this misheard word currency by giving the Indian uprising of 1857 against themselves a misleading nickname --The Sepoy Mutiny. The Uprising involved not only huge numbers of mercenary Indian soldiers under British pay and command, but also Indian princes, their subjects of various classes, their armies and camp followers, the peasantry of those parts of the Gangetic plain then under direct British control , tribal peoples of the Himalayan foothills and Northern plains and motley others. By simplifying the facts, the spin machine of the British Empire was able to promote the idea nearly unimpeded for well over a hundred years that it was all a matter of animal grease (beef and pork tallow) needed to insert rounds into Enfield rifles. How this single matter was supposed to have offended both Hindus and Muslims so much as to give rise to the events of a whole year, in which Indian soldiers and civilians massacred British men, women and children, burned down their dwellings and destroyed key installations of the colonial administration is quite a mystery. Apparently, at that time in England, a popular supple- mentary explanation for the Uprising was that everybody in India was completely enraged at having to learn to behave themselves under the wonders of British rule-- much the way we are told today that 9/11 happened because an unspecified "they" were "jealous of our freedoms." (e.g., see how it seemed to the Metcalfe family ) William Dalrymple is the first British historian to use material in translation from numerous sources written in Persian and Urdu , and among the first to use the palace and city records now stored in the National Archives, As a writer of popular histories, he has a tough row to hoe in terms of publicizing his perceptions and findings, novel and dangerous to some and not radically different enough for others. Still signing away on his book tour , I suppose, he is more inclined to discuss the hard causes of the Uprising during interviews than in this book. With respect to softer causes, like Evangelism, which he positions centrally, he doesn't indulge in overkill to make a point, but sometimes confuses anger with fear and takes at face value what he could examine a bit more critically. Animal grease and surging Evangelism were no doubt the last straw, but only because the orders to use them could not have been perceived as a simple misunderstanding after a century of many kinds of deliberate and outrageous British assaults on Indian culture, property, laws and human rights. About this, a variety of Indian and foreign-born people had already reached consensus many times , sometimes long before 1857. Those harsher provocations are not discussed in The Last Mughal , which focuses on events in Delhi, which was at that time still a grand and antique city in a state of preservation , home to an exquisite culture. One hopes WD is saving the tougher subject matter of how to assign responsibility for the background of the cataclysmic events of 1857 for another book. As it is, he has already told The Hindu that this book has made him more friends in India than in England. KASHMIRI GATE IN 1880 The book is cause for celebration. The thinking is sensitive, the language is fluid and rich. It conveys the excitement of breaking new ground, and the pictures and line drawings at the start of each chapter are delightful. The two new maps parading as old ones, in which Metcalfe House seems to dwarf the Imperial Palace , Hindus seem to live east of the Ganges and 1857 looks like the 16th century, are very silly, but one can't let that get in the way. The British sources tend towards diaries and letters, and produce an up-close-and-personal effect, while the Persian and Urdu source material is more often drawn from professional writing of various kinds, so it generates a more public voice and panoramic view. Going back and forth between the two sides of the narrative, I felt as if I was walking up and down a seesaw, faster and faster, back and forth, until the final British-led bloodbath led onto the slow, grim comedy of the denouement. As a child, I always wondered about the the strange reek inside the Mughal tombs of Delhi, something like ancient bird droppings, which was missing at the Taj Mahal. I'd been told that these crumbly, dark and elegant monuments belonged to the 16th and 17th KHOONI DARWAZA, WHERE THREE SENIOR PRINCES WERE STRIPPED, SHOT AND THEIR BODIES ROBBED OF JEWELRY by MAJOR WILLIAM HODSON centuries, and never thought about that again. Now, this book has brought home to me how recent was their ruin , how active the scent of death and decay that hangs about them still, that many of them were family mausoleums, and that my great-grandfathers had already been born before a long, gruesome seige and a grisly genocide was carried out in those environs in broad daylight. I remember the vultures were still all over Delhi more than a century later. WD's recent article in The Guardian explores similarities between British thinking in 1857 and widespread present perceptions in the West about the Iraq War. From some perspectives, the similarities are obvious and striking; from others, the similarities are not fully admissible. It is certainly alarming to find that the mainstream press has reactivated the very same language last used by the British in 1857 to describe the Uprising--- to describe THE IRAQ WAR TODAY . It is disheartening to see that in the post-colonial world, complications and spiraling violence can still be as easily provoked and fed upon by occupying forces playing on internecine rivalries. It is unpleasant to remember that the Bush Administration claimed to have received their intelligence about WMD from British sources . It is strange to see Queen Elizabeth, who last visited Washington to bestow an award on George Bush Sr. for planning and executing the first Gulf War, now returning to reinforce the military alliance . Meanwhile, Tony Blair, who should probably, given the current scheme of things, be tried by a kangaroo court and hung up to dry, is being sent off on an international farewell tour instead. One must wonder, are her private assets not yet suitably diversified? KASHMIRI GATE I appreciate and enjoy The Last Mughal for the depth and decency and richness of its narrative, and will read it many times, but I don't see the point of setting out a new and elaborate defense to counter the British allegations of 150 years ago. The British position, developed to justify deposing the monarch, was that Bahadur Shah Zafar was singularly responsible for fomenting a pan-Islamic rebellion against the British stretching from West Asia across India. Although Saddam Husein might not have been plotting anything like that either, to draw any similarities by implication and suggestion is to stretch facts to fit the polemic. The question that goes unanswered is, did the British deserve it then, and have we and anyone else done anything to deserve it now? There is no question that the movements of 1857 included Muslim jihadis, as did others that came before in the multitude of violent eruptions that represented efforts to rid the Subcontinent of the British occupation. Surely the more important point is that these populist, pan-Indian movements brought about consensus across religious and cultural lines about British wrongdoing, and eventually gave birth to cooperative, sustained resistance, rather than belonging to or advocating for any religion. Today's popular resistances in West Asia carry forward a different set of historical grievances and cultural motifs, although they may one day coalesce and draw a motley set of movements together so that even Sunni and Shia will come to terms . WD either avoids or misses a key opportunity to emphasize the crossover nature of the Uprising: When the sipahis call Zafar "Prithviraj," WD offers a literal translation, i.e., Ruler of the World. If this had been their intention, the sipahis might have called him Shah Jehan IV. Zafar was more Rajput than Timurid by blood, though he was also considered a Sufi pir, so the the sepahis were more likely referring to the heroic and legendary 12th Century Rajput emperor, Prithviraj Chauhan III , the last Hindu monarch to be seated at Delhi. But of course, at 82 years of age, though he might be the rightful emperor, Zafar could be no Prithviraj. WD suggests that if Zafar had led the charge to defend Delhi while the defense was on an upswing, he might have reversed the course of history. But at that point in the book, WD has already established that the aged cultural and spiritual leader was far too physically feeble to do anything of the kind. Except the occasional nut job, most European monarchs were by then pretty far distanced from being military leaders, and e

well many of you know the battle that is waged in the gotch household almost every day . . . jen vs. andrew in THE BATTLE OF SOUP (dah dah dah daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah). it has been a losing battle on my end for about 4 years running. you know how he has his list of foods he hates (wet meat, pulpy juice, cherries, pickles, and on and on)? well soup always seems to find it's way to the top of the list. this is a problem for me, since i am a soup lover. i love to eat soup, i love to make soup and when i feel that first bit of cold in the autumn air (which in l.a. means when it drops below 70 degrees), i want soup. and yesterday, for some odd reason, he agreed to a pot of soup. i think it is mostly because i told him it had peanut butter in it, and peanut butter is at the top of his "foods i love" list right after hamburgers. so after a short trip to the market, some chopping of vegetables, and warming of bread, soup was served. and it was good, real, real good. andrew ate every last drop, only quizzing me a few times about the ingredients. i was reluctant to tell him there was salsa in it, because he doesn't like cooked tomatoes or tomato soup. it didn't seem to phase him. he even ate the garbanzo beans, and he hates beans, except green beans. later that night, when the truth was rising to the surface, he confided in me that next time, he could do without the beans. i reminded him that he loves humus, but that was not enough. "it's a texture thing, not a taste thing" he calmly replied. either way, i feel like some progress was made here last night. there is even talk of more soup next week. i'll keep you posted. here's the recipe if you are interested.
I have some photos I've been meaning to post from David Reid who went to Lola a few months ago. I've post them all over the next few weeks!This is Makali, a bonobo rescued from a biomedical centre. He has somethign to say! Noki and her baby are in wonderful health! they've been released into the enclosures. Noki is nursing her baby well and protecting her from slapping branches and the sun. but she is also very proud and loves to show the baby to the other bonobos! ooo - i got this photo from Val when Noki just arrived at Lola. Val is a volunteer at Lola - and has been for 15 years. She works practically full time handling Lola's accounts - the sanctuary wouldn't run without her. She comes in to Lola almost every day, for no recognition or reward other than helping the bonobos. We love you Val! and look at little Noki and those huge black eyes.and then here is Val helping Noki give birth - 10 years later!we share so much with these bonobos, they become so much a part of our lives. Val has been sending photos like crazy - she is a very proud grandmother. Ok back to Lola now and I'm a little behind on all the news - but Noki had a baby!! Noki is one of the cat burglers at Lola - she is also a prolific tool user - which bonobos haven't been seen to do in the wild, fyi. once she used a long stick to steal my camera bag. noki is also one of the smartest bonobos in all the experiments we do - she is so wildly interested in all the tests and sometimes we have trouble getting her out of the testing room!  now she has a baby!! Fanny the vet was there for the whole thing, and so was Valerie, who was there when Noki was first rescued...
This week's tag was captured by John. Unlike some tags, there's little debate over what the tag is trying to convey - Peace for All! Lovely sentiments! Last week it really felt as if spring had arrived - even the sidewalks were shouting out that spring had sprung! Well, as anyone who has lived in this area for any amount of time knows, it is waaaaay too early to pack up those coats, hats and gloves. Fortunately, at least according to the AccuWeather forecast, after today, things will start improving again and the forecast is for fair skies and pleasant temperatures for the rest of the week. That's a good thing since Wednesday is St. Patrick's Day - although it's not an official holiday, in Lakewood it does appears to be a day when many people take the day off - perhaps as a "mental health day." The light grows stronger in March, perhaps it is the light which inspires the caretaker to spring clean. The garden is being prepared - the tall dried grass has been cut, the ground is bare and awaits for the evolution of spring. A squirrel has come to help the gardener and finds a wayward acorn. To see all the snaps of the second Sunday statue series go here . Yesterday while I was wandering about I met little Jenny (mixed breed puppy) and her new family. It was Jenny's first day with her new family. In addition to coming into a loving human family, Jenny will benefit from being adopted into a family with a wise and older dog Jack (seen above). As I was leaving Jenny and her family, more neighbors came up to welcome Jenny into the hood - this time a big, friendly dog and two of his humans. Today's Skywatch Friday photos were taken in the Birdtown district of Lakewood. Birdtown is Lakewood's oldest neighborhood and is home to many beautiful churches, most of the churches were founded by various immigrant groups who settled in Lakewood to work in the factories which dominated the Birdtown District. The three churches pictured today are all located on Quail Street and include St. Gregory the Theologian and Northcoast Baptist Church (above) and St. Nicholas Ukrainian Orthodox Pro-Cathedral (right). To read more about the history of Birdtown check out this wonderful website which is sponsored by the city of Lakewood. Another excellent account of the history of Birdtown can be found on this website , sponsored by the Lakewood Historical Society. To see more photos of the sky around the world visit here! Today's theme for TT is HATS! In keeping with the S nap's established Theme Thursday tradition today's puzzler takes us to an emporium of delights. Who can name this classy store which sells pretty much anything one could possibly desire? I will provide a hint in the figure of Eddie, one of the store's owners, the store is not named after Eddie, but is named after his charming wife. Eddie strikes a pose in front of just a few of the store's many hats which are displayed above his own hatless head. As you begin to wander through the store you will encounter one treasure after another - who knows you may even encounter a hat or two in the most unexpected places! The store specializes in furniture, jewelry , pottery, and glassware. The store is opened six days a week - Monday through Saturday, 11 AM to 6:00 PM. This evening after all the Snap readers have a chance to play today's puzzler, I will come back to add the name and location of today's site to today's post - and I hope the next time you are near it you will pop in and take a wander, I'm sure you won't be disappointed, and if you are like me will be sure to find something that you just had to take home! Addendum: Anonymouse nailed the store right off! congratulations! This delightful shop which is owned and operated by Eddie and Connie Dean is called Connie's Classics . It is located in the Birdtown District of Lakewood at 12603 Madison Avenue. Stop in and tell them that you read about them on the Snap! Tuesday was an absolutely beautiful day! Here's a few snaps from my walk around town. I met a few Lakewood students who graced me with an impromptu concert! This young man strikes a pose and and diverts my eye from watching the tow truck. Word to the wise - don't forget to feed those parking meters and obey the parking rules. The Lakewood traffic enforcement patrol is serious! No parking worries when a skateboard is one's main means of transportation! What came into your head when you first saw this plate? The first thing that I thought of was "one left to leave" - possibly meaning the person driving this car has one kid was still at home. And, if this is the message, are we to assume that the driver of the car is looking forward to the day when all the kids are on their own or is this a statement of anticipatory grief? However, soon I thought of another possible message - what did you think of? Inquiring minds would love to know.
first love...first sex I should say...when your whole body explodes...burns... when you feel hungry, thirsty... when all your senses are multiplied bu 100 or 1000 or... when you don't know what day it is, what time it is... then life goes on... other loves, other bodies, journeys.... but I'm still starving... naked... waiting... each time is the first time...

IT has been related to me, O happy King, said Shahrazad, that there was a certain merchant who had great wealth, and traded extensively with surrounding countries; and one day he mounted his horse, and journeyed to a neighbouring country to collect what was due to him, and, the heat oppressing him, he sat under a tree, in a garden, and put his hand into his saddle-bag, and ate a morsel of bread and a date which were among his provisions. ...................... I didn't know I would ever be able to tell about it, but it really looked like one thousand and one nights...
Whatcha got cookin'? Al the Retired Army Guy is a reader of this here blog and a student at the New England Culinary Institute. Here's a quickie blog on of one of his latest projects. From Al: Here are a few pictures of a display platter my classmates and I worked on. If you’re wondering why everything appears shiny, it is because all of the food is coated in aspic (gelatin) to give the food a shine for display purposes only. It isn’t meant for consumption, though you could eat it if you wanted to. I wouldn’t mainly due to the gelatin. Without the gelatin, though--> ;-) In the pictures you will find a terrine, a liver pate, and a duck galantine, as well as two vegetable garnishes. There is also a beet/pickled onion salad, with an orange vinaigrette (you can’t really see the vinaigrette). The single plate represents a single serving of the components contained in the platter. It took us about six hours to put five coats of aspic on every individual piece. The vegetables were individually carved and placed as well. I did the “pointy” rutabaga bases you see, as well as the chioggia beets (the purple ones, carved into fleurons or a crescent shape). I did the orange/white squares you see inside the circular garnish on the right side of the platter. The terrine, galantine, and liver pate were made for us by classmates and our instructor. Overall it was a lot of fun. All the attention to detail I learned while in the Army definitely pays off while doing things like this. - - - Looks good, Al. Now whydontcha come over here and wrangle up something for dinner? - - - Thirteen years ago, I pulled a novel from a bin at the library's used book sale and paid one dollar for it. Sapphire's Push immediately engaged me and I didn't put it down until I'd reached the last page. The book takes stylistic risks, with Precious Jones narrating her own story in a phonetically realistic voice. She is poorly dressed and obese, the sort of person many of us pass on the street and never see. Therein lies the brilliance of the novel. Push puts Claireece Precious Jones and her harrowing life squarely in front of the reader. If this was difficult and compelling to watch unfold on the page , the trailer for the movie Precious indicated it would be stunning on the screen as well. After much consideration, I decided to take my 12-year-old daughter to see Precious. "I was really rooting for Precious," I said as we talked about the movie on the way home. "Me too," said Jessie. I was bowled over by Gabourey Sidibe's portrayal of Precious. If possible, she realized Sapphire's vision with near perfection--as someone who is so easy to dismiss, until you really see her. Then she is impossible not to embrace. To be honest, I had some literary quibbles with the novel, but my respect for the risks it took overwhelmed them. The film has received raves as well as scathing criticism for being "a strange combination of liberal guilt and condescension," which is a point well taken. I apologize that I cannot find the link now, but one of the reviews I read took issue with Precious's weight saying something to the effect of must she be so fat that her face is distorted? Then darling Howard Stern chimed in last week with his obnoxious comments about Sidibe. I was infuriated by this stupidity. Don't these morons realize that the driving force of Precious is a main character who is the antithesis of Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon? Her physical size is symbolic. It's one of the reasons she will not be denied. Whether you're on the pick or pan side of the reviews, that ambition deserves respect. As for Sidibe, I think you're beautiful, Gabourey. Now go bury the likes of Stern with a long and illustrious career. - - - I apologize in advance for this, but some things just have to be gotten through. See what I mean? Now for a random list of observations. 1. No small task keeping the cleft of venus off screen in that footage. Kudos to filmmaker Gary He. 2. Those crystals aren't going to be very jazzly after BooBoo and BamBam have a few rolls in the hay. 3. What if you lose some of those crystals? I mean really lose them? "Um, SugarPop? The one wing of your butterfly is, like, gone." I think we all know just how embarrassing that's going to be. 4. I've always liked Jennifer Love Hewitt. She's not A-list or B-list. She's your A-/B+ list and I can get behind that. Hence, you can imagine my reaction when she goes on George Lopez and announces she's had some spa-person glue beads around her zorch. Who does that? 5. Regarding this exciting new phenomenon, my bud Steven Gould had this to say, "I'm still a guy who prefers hair, uh, hairy, uh, you know. Vahaired." I think he's onto something with "Vahaired." With all this new shit coming down the pike, we're going to need titles, categories--the whole drill. 6. I wonder if there are guys out there with beads stuck around their peckers. I wouldn't ever want to see any dickazzled or ballazzled anything. Nope, regular big hairy guys with beer for me. (Did you notice how I got right behind Steven on the New Age vocabulary job? I'm cool like that.) 7. I bet Snooki is jazzled in places Jennifer Love Hewitt can't even imagine. 8. You've probably noticed by now I'm avoiding the word "vajazzled." It makes me nervous. A word like that lands in your life and boy are you stuck with it. I don't like ultimatums, so I deal with this sort of thing in my own way. Hence this post. 9. I refer to my own pudendum as Glorious Steinem. - - - "I can’t think of anything that I liked in my twenties that I would want tattooed on my body now. Okay, maybe chicken Parmesan, but that would take up too much space." Now go read the rest of my good buddy Paul Ita's latest essay for masslive: My Horrible Tattoo: A Cautionary Tale for America's Young People. - - - The above word cloud is courtesy of Wordle. I cannot get enough of that silly gadget. To have your work instantaneously analyzed and transformed into a piece of literary artwork is like masturbation for writers. After Alex Pruteanu introduced me to it yesterday, I fooled around Wordling this blog, old articles, even my writing bio. The source text for today's Wordle cloud was lifted from an article wherein I recount a professional "girlie" photo session, which explains the photo on the left (yes, that is your humble hostess). You can read the full text of the article here. - - - Fifty degrees and sunny. THE CABIN-FEVER CRAZED O'BRIEN CAN FINALLY WALK OUTSIDE despite all the blasted snowdrifts. Riunite Lambrusco, anyone?

Come-hither bra display at the low grade closeout store. "Honey, springtime is high time for a new toilet." - - - A post chock full of writing tips for all the young writers who contact me with questions about this crazy business and craft. Last updated 3/8/10. - - - Start local and small. My first paid bit of writing was for Ohio Writer . For my 900-word book review of Judith Hemschemeyer's The Harvest , I was paid the royal sum of $10. That was in June of 2000 (you can see how the next ten years unfolded for me here ). Building a professional writing portfolio and the associated career takes time, and it sprouts from humble beginnings. If I were starting out today, I'd probably fish around for casual blogs associated with professional publications. Many daily and weekly print papers have online blogs that might not pay much, but would be an excellent place to earn a link and a bonafide publishing credential. Who knows? If an editor likes your style, it might lead to something more serious (and lucrative). Bonus tip: Leave a few comments on a blog (under your real name) that you might like to write for before querying the editor with your idea. Small local papers are often looking for writers to cover things like school board meetings and local government. These usually are paying gigs. I spent five years doing that sort of thing for The Broadview Journal . That stint earned me experience, street smarts, clips, a bit of local notoriety, and a steady paycheck. Get involved with a local literary or publishing organization. Here in Cleveland, we have The Lit, Cleveland Digital Publishing Users Group (CDPUG) , and the Cleveland Society of Professional Journalists. These types of organizations host all sorts of events, parties, and classes where you will meet professional writers and editors. If you want to be one of these people, you have to support what they do. That means buying their books, paying the club fees and having a genuine interest in their community. It means learning from them in an organic sense. This is perhaps the most important piece of advice I can offer a new writer. I'm sure there are plenty of online sources as well. Many professional journalists I know are members of Freelance Success for example. Go to the library. There you will find droves of books dedicated to publishing and writing advice. Librarians are wonderful and can always make good suggestions. In my home library, I have a shelf full of Writer's Market editions. Two other good books to start with are The First Five Pages and The Elements of Style. Mind your manners in a cold contact. Don't ask established writers for big favors. Never send them unsolicited writing to critique. Also, don't ask a writer to do your work for you. Finding the right publications to query is hard work. The question, "Where can I publish this?" is almost never appropriate. Get online and start researching for yourself, or go find a copy of the LMP. Follow guidelines. When you're ready to submit, follow the guidelines on the agent's or publisher's site. If there are none, a one-page query is your best bet. NEVER use cutesy fonts or graphics or anything that discredits your professionalism. Get tough. The more successful a writer is, the more rejection they've faced because they toughed it out and lived to submit another day. If you want to achieve success, you will get kicked. Hard. And repeatedly. When you get a rejection, send out another query the same day. It will help you keep your game face on. Sometimes you have to resort to Plan B and rethink your approach or your project, but giving up gets you no where. Your submission or query will likely get rejected again and again--until the one day when it gets accepted. Be warned: there is a growing trend in the publication industry wherein the powers that be simply do not respond to submissions that don't interest them. All you can do about "passive" rejections is keep a meticulous spreadsheet detailing all your queries with dates, names, pertinent websites, etc. Include any special notes as well. How long you wait to give up on getting a response is up to you, although sometimes an agency or publication will have response time info on their webpage. Simultaneous submissions? Again, your call. You are your own publicist. The days of the reclusive and mysterious writer sucking deeply from a Winston before his trusty Royal typewriter are gone. You must represent yourself and you must do it online. Prospective agents and publishers are busy people with no patience for ineptitude. If your information is more than a click away, you'll lose them. I recommend you maintain two types of webpage. This blog is my main active webpage. Content here is frequently updated. Here is my static/informational site. Content there does not change very often. If you are just starting out, your static page might simply include some education and contact information, and your active page may be a twitter account. However you choose to do it, you must have these things. Design, develop and shape them in a way that properly represents you and your work. They will evolve with you. They will surprise you as well. Bonus tip #1: Google Docs is a brilliant tool for creating static public webpages. Bonus tip #2: The way you drive a readership to your blog is by going to other sites that have the sort of readers you are trying to attract and leaving brilliant comments. And now for some miscellaneous links: They don't call it "submission" for nothing. Where I go to bellyache about writing. A whole podcast featuring Erin on Writing. Lastly, a bit of nostalgia. When I was a kid, I had a Mattel Knit Magic toy. You threaded the yarn through this squiggly little thing in the front, turned the crank, and PRESTO! a knitted tube would come out the bottom of the plastic machine. You were supposed to be able to do all sorts of things with the tubes, make groovy hats and stuffed dolls and scarves, but all I ever ended up with was a long tube, (although I did love my Knit Magic machine). When I lead discussions on writing, I often say that there is no Essay Magic machine, wherein you thread an idea in, turn a crank and watch an essay wind out from the bottom. The process I go through in order to produce a good solid piece of writing is laborious, wonderful, frustrating, difficult and satisfying. It has matured through the years. It is important to be in love with your process, to truly revel in the revelations, and savor the small victories. If you focus solely on that "big" publication, you risk missing the small and wonderful things that happen along the way. Write because you have something to say and your own way to say it. Write because you are driven to the craft. Above all, write because we need the good writers. We need their words and observations. We need them to scale and record the human condition. I will likely revise this page from time to time, so stop by again. And if you have good news, bad news, or your own advice to share, please do tell all in the comment section. Best of luck, Erin - - - My daughter had a tummy ache yesterday and we soothed it with many things, including a healthy dose of MTV's Liquid Television, which was one of my favorites shows of all time. We have about six hours of Liquid Television on VHS (taped in the 90s), so there was enough for this tummy ache and the next one as well. It worked perfect-as-you-please in the tape player that's still hooked up to our shitty 20" CRT television. I swear, people, this is how you win. - - -

It's really a day for telling everyone we love&#8212;family, friends, pets&#8212;that we care and are glad they are in our lives. So this is me, telling you :) xx GG Image from the cover of the March 1928 Film Fun magazine, by Enoch Bolles. From the Romeo & Juliet photoshoot by Annie Leibovitz for the December 2008 issue of Vogue. &nbsp; I woke up to hear the news: Lee McQueen has died at age 40. He was found dead in his London home, having committed suicide due to depression which set in after his mother's death last week. My thoughts go out to his friends and family. On the Alexander McQueen website is this statement: "On behalf of Lee McQueen's family, Alexander McQueen today announces the tragic news that Lee McQueen, the founder and designer of the Alexander McQueen brand, has been found dead at his home. At this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with Lee's family. Lee's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this." While most of us fans and fashion lovers never knew him personally, we feel the loss keenly. McQueen was an exciting, inspiring designer and, through his clothes and runway shows, he made a connection with us. He will be missed for a long time to come. Wendy Brandes posted this video of a holographic Kate Moss floating in air like an angel, in an ethereal Alexander McQueen gown. I agree &#8212; one of the most beautiful things ever to grace a runway. There will be no more posts today, out of respect for a great designer, who left this world too soon.

Activists help put an end to gross negligence and primate deaths at a University lab . It's amazing to me that most Universities, even seemingly progressive ones like UC Berkeley, conduct useless experiments on animals. Legendary "Humanzee" Oliver, his friends, and the bitter fight over animal welfare at a Texas refuge . "MEPs Jens Holm, Caroline Lucas, Sajjad Karim, and Robert Evans are today calling on other MEPs to back a landmark call to make plans for an end to the use of chimpanzees and monkeys in experiments across the European Union (EU) . The call comes at a point when almost 50 MEPs have signed a declaration before the European Parliament to end primate research across the EU in the next six years." Let's hope the U.S. wakes up and follows Europe's lead. I find it very sad that we as a nation aren't leading this fight for compassionate science. New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) has the most captive primates in the world, and is affiliated with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. A former employee revealed disturbing allegations of animal cruelty that prompted an investigation and lawsuit , and another group that analyzed reports requested from the University (as is our right under the Freedom of Information Act) found disturbing signs of abuse and neglect relating to a group of rhesus monkeys . NIRC has also conducted maternal deprivation experiments , what I consider to be one of the more cruel, useless, abominable "research" activities. Write to Thomas J. Rowell, the veterinarian in charge, and request that the aging chimpanzees under his care be released to a sanctuary. These animals will not be forgotten. Thomas J. Rowell, DVM New Iberia Research Center University of Louisiana at Lafayette 4401 W. Admiral Doyle Drive New Iberia, LA 70560 Karen - age 48 Billy Ray - age 47 Clay - age 46 Diana - age 46 Jan - age 46 Julius - age 46 Lady Bird - age 46 Pumpkin - age 46 Sandy - age 46 Walter B. - age 46 For example, Primarily Primates, Inc. , which housed several retired research chimps, is apparently a pit of despair. Also, facilities that receive federal funding such as Chimp Haven must return animals to laboratories if they are requested to. In my book, that's not really retirement. Project R&R; has a list of sanctuaries that can take animals , and notes which have received funding, and I assume approval, from them. Personally, after watching Chimpanzees: An Unnatural History on PBS and getting to "know" Gloria Grow , I think the Fauna Sanctuary is truly a place that's earned it's name. Most Americans think that chimpanzees who have spent more than 10 years in research deserve to be retired : seventy-one percent of us, in fact. Despite this, nearly 90 percent of lab chimps have been used for more than 10 years. Jane Goodall's pioneering research has opened a window into the private lives of chimps. To read how similiar they are to humans, visit JGI's Chimpanzee Central . "Once we admit that we are not the only beings with personality, reasoned thought, and above all, the ability to feel and express emotions such as joy, despair and empathy, then we develop a new respect for chimpanzees. The line between human and other non-human beings, once thought so sharp, becomes blurred. This forces us to a new respect also for the other amazing animal beings with whom we share the planet. " From the Wisconsin State Journal : "A Dane County judge said Monday that the law is on the side of animal-rights activists who want to buy buildings next to the UW-Madison's primate labs and open a museum highlighting the cruelty they say happens at the labs."
This has a nice Homer Simpson vibe to it. And let's face it, who else could qualify as the original airhead better? My mental age just hit somewhere where it can only be defined as 'very old, bordering on senility and that stage when the fridge seems like the optimal spot for any sort of keys, the husband's deodorant, and Mitzy, the little hand-bag size poodle'.&nbsp;Or perhaps I finally bore witness to that thing called a blond moment , made so famous by Jessica Simpson of the notorious chicken of the sea fame. Or was it Marilyn Monroe (Oh no! Am I having another one? Of those moments . Or was it that Monroe was just having more fun...? Nngh! She does look like she was having oodles of fun in her hayday, but then again she did kill herself, so I don't quite know what that does to the whole having more fun than brunettes or redheads, and... What was I saying? Am I still writing an aside in the parentheses? Shit.) What? Shit. Oh yes. I was writing about my interesting discussion at the gas station today. In case that wasn't completely obvious from the Marilyn Monroe references. Nothing says gas like Marilyn, right? "Please fill it up," I say, and the man smiles at me through my open window. There are the usual questions on the water and oil and something I think sounds like 'carlage' but which I haven't actually told them to check yet, not even to find out what carlage might mean, when I hear the gas pump click. "Hmm, that's awfully soon," I mumble to myself and frown in what I always believe is an endearing manner, but might just be scaring the bejeezus out of the attendant, as I'm pretty sure I can see his lip quiver just a little when he approaches me again. "52 rand," the man tells me. "What? That's not possible! I had less than half a tank left! How much did you put in?" I open with, but decide to make things easier for myself as him telling me 5 liters or 50 is not going to mean anything to me anyway, "wait, scratch that. Did you fill it allllll the way up?" I make a sign that to me signifies full, but probably means that I would like to hitch a ride to Baragwanath hospital on one of the local taxis. Which I probably should not do. Or that's at least what every single person I've told about my two taxi-rides in Soweto says as they look at me like I'm insane. "Yes ma'am, allllll the way up" says the attendant and makes a sign that might mean that he too is in need of some sort of transportation. I start the car and watch the gauge that doesn't move at all. "See!" I yell and point at the dashboard, "There's something wrong!" "Madam, that's the temperature gauge." Now, where to find a new gas station I can start frequenting? Looks sufficiently medicinal, but is in fact taken at a vineyard. You might not know this, or may not have guessed it since I've been told more than once that it isn't exactly a thing I radiate and would possibly even sneer at, apparently because of my cynical ,&nbsp; professional and rational-seeming exterior... I fokken know. I mean, really? WHAT IN THE NAME OF PLATONICALLY FROLICKING UNICORNS WOULD GIVE ANYONE THIS IDEA?!?! See, right there, I just had to scream because it was sort of warranted. the whole thing's just that utterly confounding to me. Utterly. ...but I am a strong believer in the power of alternative medicine, the role of nutrition, vitamins, and such other like things, when it comes to staying healthy or being cured. So I pop a lot of pills of the supplement variety. I drink a lot of wheatgrass juice. In the mornings I like to brew liqorice-root and cinnamon infused green tea to be sipped (and to hopefully cancel out some of the negative effects) right alongside my several cups of morning coffee. I eat a lot of broccoli and spinach. I chew on flax seeds. I drink incredible amounts of water. I buy organic. Somehow, almost without noticing it myself, I seem to have become one of those people. Those annoying people who show up at a dinner and won't eat half of the things on their plate because they either contain sugar, white flour, starch, dairy, or something passing itself as fruit but which is closer to a lump of sugar, just not as refined. Those irritating people who can comfortably talk about the benefits of vitex agnus castus as a dietary supplement for at least a good 20 minutes, and don't even get them started on superfoods. Those boring people who swear by a green concoction of wheatgrass, spinach, cucumber, avocado, and some alfalfa as the best snack ever. Those frightening people whose pee is always neon yellow from excess vitamin C and completely discussible with anyone, odor included. One of them . Which I thought was a mainstream movement and I was just a little slow at catching on. Yes? Aren't we all pretty much those people by now? At least mostly. Surely we're all on the 2010-version wagon of 'you are what you eat'? We all understand and respect the awesome power of traditional medicine, but don't sneer at new, or sometimes 'ancient', developments in the form of uses of medicinal plants, acupuncture, patient-specific treatments, yada yada and all that jazz, right? Turns out, nope. For quite some time I have been managing my condition that involves a severe hormonal imbalance among other wondrous medical phenomena, without taking one pill of the drug variety. (Okay, so in the last year truly managing, prior to that just refusing to take the drugs and sometimes suffering quite a load of consequences. I admit. I like wine, burgers and coffee. So sue me, oh body of mine.) When I was diagnosed in Denmark more than five years ago, it was the doctor who pointed me to a site on the internet with more information about a necessary diet, the necessary supplements, the correct kind of exercise, and other such hoopla. The website was pink in color, but it was doctor recommended, so I read it and have now finally followed. Without a need for any kind of drugs. Well, coffee and wine of course, but they are more in the 'necessity for ultimate survival of the human race' category anyway. However, here in South Africa, it seems that those people don't quite exist yet, and that medical 'developments' are running a vastly different course, if not a whole different race. "Either you manage your condition with medicine or you suffer and live with the consequences," the doctor, a prominent gynecologist and an elderly man, says, looks at me and sneers. "But I haven't actually had any 'consequences' in the year I've been managing it with natural products and diet," I respond. And, as much as I hate to admit it, I do the air quotes. Yup. I do. "Well, that's all pure nonsense," the doc blurts out, "show me one [fancy word I don't know what means] placebo [other fancy word I don't know what means, the flippen a-hole] study out there." The doctor laughs and I stare at him. "Just because there aren't studies out there doesn't mean the products and diet do not work. There aren't any studies out there showing they don't work either," is what I should have said, but instead I just stare. Also, the ultrasound device inside me is throwing off my 'tude mojo some serious. And the doctor just laughs. And then he laughs again when I tell him I refuse to go back on the medicine because of the side effects, since according to him there aren't any. THE ASSHOLE. There I go, screaming again. Maybe it's the 'consequences'. Growing up Finnish, mainly in Finland, guaranteed a few things. 1) Someone, at some point of my fragile youth (I'm thinking the big mean high school sports coach, and yes, I too was fragile at one point in my life. Was too!) made sure I learned how to ski. Cross country. Fast. Even if I was wailing like a lunatic while frog-legging it up a steep hill with my increasingly slippery skis on. But Finns must all know how to ski. Yes they do. And&nbsp;I still hate skiing like the plague. Only worse. 2) I didn't have to learn how to hug, compliment, or express any kind of affection through any other means than slightly raising my left eyebrow and grunting softly. Or by emptying the dishwasher. Or vacuuming my own room without being yelled at. Or making a full pot of coffee instead of just two cups for myself. Or not telling my best friend she looked like crap even if she totally did (Pigtails never look good. No they don't). I learned to love the Finnish way. Except for skiing. That I learned to hate. Like hundreds of thousands of other Finns before and after me. Why am I talking about skiing and affection? Together? WHY? Why would I combine possibly the worst memories I have of Finland and being Finnish with love? Ah well. I'm not completely there. Or here. Yet. The lights are on, but the lady's still under the covers. This past week saw me return to Finland at a time I normally avoid. I was supposed to be landing in the warmth of Cairo, but instead, at the airport, which incidentally instead of Cairo was in the freezing north also known as Helsinki, around midnight, I was met with -17 degrees celsius and my tired brother. My grandma suddenly passed away and my family needed me. Which was a first, because we Finns don't tend to need other people, or at least we won't say so. As it turns out, they really did need me. They needed the one person in the family who has learned to hold hands with anyone else than their significant other (mine taught me that!), to hug, to console with words that are in no way masqueraded as grunts, to go beyond household chores as far as displays of affection go, and to laugh through tears and not be terribly embarrassed by it. But that was only to get the ball rolling. For the first time in my life I hugged my Grandpa. And he hugged me back. I held his hand. I consoled him. I talked with him about Grandma, about Africa, about traveling, about getting a good fire going, about my childhood, and about the life from now on. And then I talked with my mother. I held her hand. I hugged her. I consoled her. And she hugged me back. And we talked. Last week, I learned the true depth of the love, I had sometimes doubted even really existed, between my Grandpa and my Grandma. I learned about the way my Grandpa would, whenever my Grandma wasn't there, literally count the hours to her return. I learned about his desperation at her open casket. I learned about the completely missing 'I' in everything he's ever done. I learned about how Finns, and by that I mean FINNS because that's what my war-veteran Grandpa is to the core, can love too, really love to a point where it takes your breath away. I learned that perhaps I'm not so special after all, with my fancy hand-holding, foreign hugging, and the continuous 'I love you's. I learned that underneath that uncomfortable and repressed seeming eyebrow wiggling and vacuuming instead of talking, there are some serious and deep emotions coming out of Finland too. Some serious love. With all that enforced skiing, who would have guessed? &nbsp; &nbsp; How to handle this? How to talk about this? My Grandmother on my mother's side passed away on Monday afternoon. She wasn't very old and she wasn't very sick. She had a heart attack putting away groceries while my Grandfather was getting firewood from the shed. She wasn't breathing when my Grandfather found her and there was nothing the paramedics could do to bring her back. She was gone. She is gone. Her last word was 'coffee'. She was going to make some for herself and my Grandpa, which is only fitting, since that's what she spent most of her life doing. There was always hot coffee. Or at least the thought of making some and then drinking some. Always coffee. For everyone. Imagine her horror when she found out that my Viking didn't drink coffee. The first few times she simply ignored the exotic ways of this weirdo foreigner and poured some in his cup anyway, but once she found out that instead of the Viking it was I who was secretly downing the manna in his cup in addition to my own, she solemnly ordered him to "At least drink milk, boy". Loudly. And in Finnish. I think that's when the Viking (after a sugarcoated translation from me) finally understood what it meant for me to say that I loved him "even more than coffee." In not so many days I'll be in Finland, sitting in my mother's kitchen, drinking copious amounts of Finnish coffee, and talking about my Grandmother. While my mother makes sure there's hot coffee in the pot. Always coffee. For everyone. My Grandmother will be missed. May I offer you something rotten to go with your morning coffee? Warning : This here particular diatribe will include stuff about weight, losing it (weight and temper), flying, How much I love Kevin Smith, and other assorted controversial things (Maybe. Depends on what the maid decides to do with the wineglasses she's supposedly washing). So, if you're tired of the whole SWA humiliating innocent Kevin Smith debacle ( something along the lines of this moron's view ) go away and come back when I return to inadvertently trying to kill the guards at my gate (I would never, but they insist on hopping in front of the car at the weirdest places) or just to my general doing nothing and then some more nothing, and shoes. Because, today, I have been thinking. Pondrin somthin serious. In the last couple of days I have been following Kevin Smith 's (who really, truly is some kind of a god-like force within comedy, if you disregard certain extremely carnal and perhaps even unnecessary tweets about him boning his wife, and I will disregard them and love him nonetheless) experience with flying on, or at least trying to, Southwest Airlines. How he got booted off of the flight that he had already been seated on (with the armrests down and not 'spilling' onto his fellow passengers) because he had gotten on that flight as a standby and had actually, for reasons relating to his own comfort on the flight and because he's probably fairly wealthy seeing as he's a really successful funnyman (How do I love Clerks and Mallrats? Let me count the ways.), bought two seats for the later flight he had originally selected. Thus apparently officially 'admitting' that he was fat, in fact too fat to fly in one seat. Now, if you have been following this blog for a while you all know how I feel about flying , how much my derriere detests even the mention of it , how my thighs protest violently every time even the thought of travel pops into my head , and how badly my brain wants to grow to the level where I can invent an easier way of moving from one place to another - a teleportation device if you will, or even a Harry Potter-ish fireplace of travel, just without house elves, thank you very much - without having to subject any part of me to the experience that is check-in, airport security, boarding, other people's 'hand luggage', flight, in-flight 'entertainment', stewardesses (especially the ones I seem to encounter. Hello Air France!), airplane seats, airplane bathrooms, other frikken passengers, customs, and having my luggage mangled and/or efficiently spirited away (always to London, it seems). I consider having to fly anywhere a punishment of epic proportions. Mainly due to the extreme discomfort of airplanes for anyone who isn't 5'4 and weigh at the most 100 lbs. Because, naturally, airlines want to make as much money as they can, and thus squeeze as many of us as possible into the smallest space possible. Regardless of whether or not we really fit. Comfort and friendly skies my ass. Torture and bitchiness is much closer to the truth. I hate the journey. I do. Also, if you indeed have been following this blog for a while, you would know that I've never been a small specimen of a woman. Expressions such as East-German shot-putter, Amazon, and perhaps even Grand Dame (No, sorry, that was to do with champagne I think, but what the hell, I like it) have come up. But what you don't know, unless you know how to decipher my cryptic hints, is that today I'm perhaps 50 lbs lighter than I was when I last had to make a plane trip longer than 2 hrs. Still, I'm a fat woman. I'll always, always be a fat woman. Regardless of how I look on the outside. And will never think there is anything wrong with being a fat woman. Or a fat man even (still, I think I'm going to stay a woman. I like my boobies too much to exchange them for just one overly dangly piece of anything). Weight loss has neve
 been a goal for me, nor will it ever be. I strongly disagree with what normally passes as equal to healthy, and what kind of appearance almost automatically gets labeled as unhealthy, slovenly, lazy, undesirable, ugly, or second rate. My recent change has come about as a side effect to some changes (such as saying no to most fruit, traditionally considered an unhealthy decision) that have been quite necessary, and due to a genetic condition I have, in order for me to not need medicine that shouldn't be mixed with alcohol (and I seriously do want to keep drinking the wine, if in smaller amounts than before), for the sake of my poor liver, and to save poor VEG from her siamese-sister contractual obligation to give me a piece of hers when mine finally conks out. So I feel for Kevin Smith. And I whole-heartedly support him. Awesome of him to use his fame, regardless of how humiliating the situation must have been for him, and bring some much needed attention to this kind of treatment received by all of us overweight peeps often enough world over. In all kinds of situations. More often than one would think. Because, discrimination based on one's weight is unwarranted for. This kind of discrimination, like is in the case of smokers, could only be tolerated IF overweight actually directly also spelled harm to others, and/or costs to others. Which it doesn't. It's often said that it does, but the truth is that it doesn't. It just doesn't. Sure, there are many extremely unhealthy people who are sure to end up having [insert a costly medical procedure right here] before they are 40 years old who are also overweight, but it just isn't that overweight which makes it so. That overweight is just a symptom. Then there are many extremely healthy people who will live to be a nice 104 (and might in doing so end up costing quite a few bucks to society as well, I might add) who are overweight. There are many extremely unhealthy people who are sure to end up having [insert a costly medical procedure right here] before they are 40 years old who are 'normal' (who tell hell decided what was normal anyway?) weight. And so on. Case by case. All people are individuals, and the beauty (and the curse) of statistics is that you can have them display for you exactly what you want. That's why the media loves statistics. They sound official enough to back up a report about a 'fat epidemic' and can easily be made to play into that end. And a fat epidemic just hits so much closer to home than an actual epidemic STILL sweeping the world: the AIDS epidemic. I don't need to remind anyone how many people die of AIDS in sub-saharan Africa EVERY SINGLE DAY do I? There's no way this number isn't plastered on every single front page all the time. What? It isn't? Well, shit! I guess the 4100 people a day who die of AIDS in sub-saharan Africa are a drop in the ocean compared to the thousands and thousands of people who succumb to the evil, evil epidemic of having a BMI over 25 every single day. &nbsp;I guess it's the 6 in the 26 that wraps around their hearts and slowly suffocates them. Must be. Fat does not automatically equal unhealthy. Nor does thin equal healthy. In my part of Africa fat can also equal wealthy, beautiful, handsome, healthy, and happy. It's all cultural. It really is. And while we have, hopefully (although evidence to the contrary seems to be surfacing around me constantly) stopped categorizing and judging people based on the color of their skin or their gender, weight remains the last frontier of 'accepted discrimination'. And who is it that is making it so? Well, us. You guys, we suck. Why are we so fokken dumb? One last thing in the way of warning : Should you feel you disagree with me on this one and feel the need to tell me so in a comment or in an email, I WILL immediately think less of you. I will consider such a response equal to you telling me you loved the Twilight saga and didn't see anything wrong with how it portrays women and girls, or how you identify with the characters in Marian Keyes novels. I WILL think much less of you, your intellect, and your ability for compassion. Much, much less. &nbsp; Lately, since I've been leaving the house almost every single day - albeit mainly to buy shoes (Thank you Zeus for Stave Madden), but also to work on all sorts of exciting projects with just a pinch of introducing some honest American English to unsuspecting souls in a (Whoa!) classroom situation (it gets better...) with moi actually in charge (when you say it all together like that the result is quite scary and unpalatable, I know) - I've again been subjected to one of the things I don't particularly miss from my life in Mexico City (Yes I do! I miss it all!), but that very likely accounted for quite a few months out of the couple year span. Yup. Traffic. Trafico . I have such fond memories of inching down Reforma, one of the main arteries of Mexico City, for hours on end in my burgundy shoebox of a Chevy with zero air conditioning. Wearing exhaust fumes like a fine perfume. Buying all of my cleaning products at intersections. Chatting to beggars in broken español . Singing along to the songs on that weird Mariachi radio station without actually knowing the words (cept for Cielito Lindo . Everyone knows Cielito Lindo . Besides it's just a whole lot of ay ay ay ay and then some more ay ay ay ). Watching my suction cup Jesus gently sway in the furiously circulating lukewarm air. And believe it or not, sometimes playing sudoku. Honest. And here I am again, stuck in traffic. Granted, regardless of still conforming to the universally accepted definition of traffic (as opposed to the Finnish definition which can be loosely understood as: "Shit. There's someone else on the road at the same time as me! Holy Cow! I must watch out now."), the traffic here in Jozi is nowhere near the kind of sea of ebbing and flowing waves of chaos associated with Mexico City. Still, it's something you sit in for longer than you had initially intended or hoped. Until you run out of boogers to fish out of your nose, and that weird, red something between your teeth that looks like tomato peel although you can't remember when you last had anything with tomato in it just does not enthrall you like it did a minute ago. But traffic's different here. Simply not slow enough to play sudoku, put on makeup, tweeze my eyebrows (I don't really, just putting it out there as a potential), work out what the hell that black stuff underneath my nail is and why can't I wash it off, come up with seven different ways of wearing my faux-hawk with the help of multiple mirrors available in my car, or make up stories of people who have those stupid 'baby on board' suction-cup thingies on the rear window in which (the stories that is) they always have dark family secrets or possibly an extra toe/finger/other magnificent appendage (never claimed to have a normal imagination). Too fast for anything but radio. Thus, I'm actually finally coming to my point. Yes, there fokken was one all along. There really was! (Well, okay. Maybe not a point, but more of a theme. A unifying factor. Yes.) &nbsp; And my point is a series of questions to you people: How loud is it acceptable to sing along to 50 Cent's Baby By Me? Does 'doing that weird vogue movement' with your head make any difference? Is Baby By Me the new Baby Got Back? How frikken awesome is P!nk? Why don't more people sing loudly in their cars? What is it called when you kind of dance along behind the steering wheel? What do you do to kill time in traffic? I know. I do. I blame the mother-in-law. Maybe you should too. Whilst I was wildly careening around Southern Africa, expertly &nbsp;dodging (Ahem! Yes. You have to own your strengths and avoidance of things is what I do best.) my mother-in-law's sneaky attempts at... what? I'm not sure, but she was definitely up to something sneaky and evil-ish, who knows with her? To wean me off her precious eldest so that he can find a nice Danish girl? To magically make me forget about contraception (and actually suddenly gain the ability to reproduce) and populate the earth with tiny ginger-haired half-vikings for her to clothe and give hard candy to? To make me eat a sugary dessert? To feed me to the lions? To ... What was I saying? Oh yes. Whilst I was romping around my part of this continent with my spirit safely stowed away in the upstairs shower, and taking crap from a certain someone without once raising a finger and only sometimes an eyebrow and only rolling my eyes and sighing when she couldn't see or hear, something wonderful happened. Somehow, at some office of the infamous South African postal service someone decided to deliver two (I know. TWO! I can't get over the number, which usually is more like 0, the remains of 1, "Ma'am, there is no delivery for you", 1/3, "Are you accusing us of theft ma'am?" or less than 0) packages to me. TWO!!! (I know I already said it, but two is almost unheard of. A mythical number postal delivery-wise. Possibly a sign that somewhere up there, an angel finally has his wings. Or a pig flies. Or a baby unicorn frolics. Or Hitler's learning to snowboard, way way below up there and everyone else in the bad man's case, of course.) It is as if the universe knew who was visiting me. And wanted to stop me just shy of a violent act. By making me remember how wonderful a place this world of the interwebz can actually be. And how well my bloggy pals really do know me. I present to you in order of arrival: A thing of pure beauty and ingenuity that really truly encompasses a good deal of my personality. Something to do with golf and then again, something to do with my blatant inability to golf. A way to become better without actually doing anything really taxing about it. I've always thought voodoo might very well be the answer to most of my problems. Or at least a more exciting way of ignoring them and not dealing with them than your most garden-variety means of procrastination. A Golf Voodoo Kit From my beloved siamese sister (who lets me ignore her just as I do my biological family) VEG of the (Mis)Adventures of VEG . Go read her! She is very much like a Canadian me . Except that instead of drinking wine, she recycles. Followed by a mere day by another thing of pure beauty and ingenuity that really truly encompasses a good deal of my personality. Something to do with coffee. Well, actually the precious infant born to Arabica and Light roast: Starbucks. Which I love only slightly less than the Viking. A Starbucks Christmas ornament and a card made by the sender herself From my dear, dear friend and part-Finn Erin of My Camera and The Gentle Giant . Go check out her wonderful photos , learn about her life , or at least go check out something very close to her heart: autismspeaks.org Thank you universe for people who love me and remember me. Even when my spirit's in storage. Love you right back people! Not you, mother-in-law . So. Mother-in-laws. They, and you (by which I actually mean ME ME ME ME ME!!!), are better off in their own little corners of the world. Or at least that's my immediate experience. A hypothesis now firmly grounded in the severity of reality and made into an iron-clad fact. This here = my corner, that one over there far, far away = the mil's niche. And we all can live happily ever after, like tradition, and Disney and each and every 80s teen movie, promise. And that Molly Ringwald, she wouldn't lie, would she? So, please bugger off dear mama and let me have my prince already! The Viking's mine and no matter what you do, there is no way you will ever be able to shove him back up there. You know, up to Denmark, in case some of you were thinking I meant the uterus, which I did initially, but then I just decided to discard that image altogether lest it screw me up for good, so we'll just say Denmark. The sentiment still applies. Between me and her (feel free to add your own disrespectful tone here) I prefer a distance of a few continents, and at least one whole ocean if at all possible, but I have heard - although this is something I would never personally accept or recommend - that a mere 'few countries to the East' is sometimes sufficient. Well. Not for me. Still, like they say, bad things happen to good people. And sometimes she (please amp up the disrespectful tone from before) is to be found right under one's nose. In one's spare bed. Loudly criticizing one's choice of linen, innards of the fridge (so the packet of crazy glue says to keep it in the fridge!), lack of tan, and the water pressure or the magical lack of it during her (you know the drill now) showers. And all that before the discussions about the ' unpalatable food of Africa' were ever even entered into. But it's time to move on, she 's (I know you know what to do...) gone. It's time to be generally glad that no one threw a punch or drew actual blood, intentionally or unintentionally, that doors have locks, that a car can drive you far, far away, that there was a fair amount of laughter, be it fake, distraught, to mask the tears or actual, that lions were being cooperative and not hiding in the bushes, giving everyone a welcome break from the evil eyes being shot left and right (I'm sure the lions never even knew what hit them), that regardless of not-so-veiled threats absolutely no one threw the poor daughter-in-law to them in best Roman style, that Spar sells wine early in the morning on a Tuesday, that a spot of archery and a wild imagination can relieve a pent up need to scream without any actual screaming, that world has coffee and alcohol and coffee-flavored alcohol in it, and that the Viking knows to take my (and only my) side. And that my father-in law (who doesn't detest me nearly as much as I thought he did) and her (yada yada blah blah) managed to create someone I can call my bestest friend in the whole wide world, whom I love more than life itself, and to whom I'm the center of the universe without still quite figuring out how I manage to pull that off on a daily basis. And that he is the wonderful person that he is. Thankful, yet homicidal. Hmm. Just give me a couple of days to retrieve my spirit from the top secret storage location (okay, the upstairs, master bedroom shower, that has excellent water pressure, I might add) I've had it shoved up into, to keep it safe from harm and any potential vampiristic, i.e. Hey-Zeus-help-me-this-woman's-sucking-every-single-drop-of-life-force-and-other-assorted-positive-things-right-out-of-me activities. But I WILL be whole again. And I'm still breathing. HA!
There was a stream of cars passing right before I took this picture. Each one paused as it approached the green light, thanks to the curb extension which pinched the intersection as well as making the walk crossing distance so much shorter. Such a nice treatment for this block, which is actually rather lengthy though residential, with parking on both sides. Cars used to speed up the hill to catch the green light - this pinch point helps to remind them to take it easy. In the world of transportation, this is really great stuff and part of the Downtown Brooklyn Traffic Calming study , which T.A. instigated ages ago, and is finally coming to fruition. There are more than 100 improvements slated for this spring according to the NYC DDC and above is an excellent example. An interesting thing about NYC's improvements on the street: though there is an attempt to standardize improvements with the Street Design Manual , there is also a wide variety of applicable treatments. These are the first white ADA-compliant curb cuts I've seen in the city - I've also seen yellow and gray. I kinda like that there is some flexibility and experimentation with this, and not one size (or color) fits all. After decades of one-size fits cars, seeing how things break loose is rather fun. Image by Youngna Park, available via the always wonderful 20x200 Exciting news! T.A. is starting up a Planning Corps, to gather together planners/designers and apply their amazing skills for change on our streets. This idea was hatched out of numerous conversations with two different groups that only sometimes interact. One set was with T.A. staff who wanted to beef up on technical expertise and stay relevant. The face of advocacy has changed considerably in the past few years, tools are very different, technology development outpaces a small non-profit organization's ability to keep up, and the political climate is very different. Generally, we're pretty nimble, but this is partly because we know when to change accordingly. The second set of conversations was with planners who had a itch to change the conventions of urban planning. How do we use planning in a way that benefits communities and organizations that really need it, instead of contributing to master plans that sit on the shelf or to EIS's that become a mockery of true environmental sustainability impacts? Not to say that long-term planning isn't necessary, but what can be done now to enable change? A call was put out for planners (e-mail me if you're in the NYC area and are interested in participating) and a project list from T.A. staff was compiled. But... As I was trying to come up with projects that people could work on, I realized that I was really grappling with conventions of planning and experiencing how deeply ingrained they really are. The staff came up with a long list of projects necessary for their campaigns. Most of them are those that are one-on-one with a staffer or small group (aka the "client"), longer-term due to research, data collection, where the planner goes off to do work, whatever that is, and hopefully comes back with a final product. But the ones that the planning group expressed interest in are those that can be done in a group, at once and still end up with something useful. (Charrettes qualify, but few other things do - can you think of any?) I was really challenged with coming up with "on the spot" project ideas where a group planners could come in and get their hands dirty right away. At minimum, planning projects must have a strong connection to T.A. advocacy - so that there is a high potential for change. That part wasn't hard. What was hard was thinking about re-structuring work so that it had at-the-moment application and was highly productive. I stopped worrying about how it would happen and embraced the idea that what we needed could be done in many different ways. But, that means that the hard work is really on us, the organizers of Planning Corps, to structure creatively any piece of work on the existing project list so that it can be done in a group, at once and productively. If we get through this though then maybe we'll start to see a shift in how planning can change. Planning Corps is new with lots of space for experimentation, so if you have ideas and suggestions, please do share. Our first meeting will be March 24, location TBD. People's schedules change quite a bit as job/personal responsibilities shift, so the hope is that the way Planning Corps works - matching planners to non-profits/campaigns for change - will endure. It's all over the transportation world, but worth posting about here. NYC is getting closer and closer to delivering transitways - first Select Bus Service , especially the designs for 1st and 2nd Aves, now this proposed project on 34th Street . Thanks DOT for trying out another innovative design in CBD Manhattan. This is a huge improvement in terms of prioritizing use on our streets. What do vehicles really need to move? This is a much more efficient use of the public right-of-way, let alone a vast improvement over streets clogged with one-passenger cars. You can leave comments on the project page and there's a series of public input workshops going on this spring. (I would be curious about handling bicycle traffic, curbside management of drop-offs and deliveries, and timing of projects in other boroughs). via Streetsblog , which you should visit for a detailed discussion and some interesting comments Always love to see who wins the Young Architects Program competition to design the front yard of P.S. 1 . Pole Dance by SO-IL doesn't look as salacious as it sounds. d, you're coming back to NYC for the opening, right? Go for it! Update: not public space related, nor really planning related, I realized belatedly. Did I really fall for the sparkling logo? Maybe. From GOOD the OBJECTIVE Make an infographic about neighborhoods and/or your neighborhood. the Assignment Missed the MAK Center's how many billboards in LA. Update: Was wondering how I missed the billboards when I crossed paths with the art so many times...in the car that is. I'm rarely in a car in general. Guess I never looked up in LA. I'm fascinated by driving behavior in general. Everyone trying to talk to each other while muted; imagine trying to tell someone where you are going while covering your mouth. Little signals mean a lot. I also obsess over pedestrian behavior: are they walking for fitness, fun or work, with friends, where are they walking to/from, do they cross with the light? Enthralled by the few mixed-use retail areas. It seemed like LA lacks bus shelters though there are many bus riders. Finally, I literally count cyclists, check out their bike and see if they obey traffic laws. Total urban planning-transpo-geek. Real guerrilla gardening from the artist Pete Dungey .
Julia has a friend who started keeping bees four or five years ago. The friend had four hives. Almost as soon as she started on this hobby, a crisis occurred - her house burned in a really bad fire. So the bees have lived in her backyard for four years with nobody taking care of them.
The friend invited Julia (my partner at Blue Heron) to come and salvage these hives. Julia in turn invited me, dangling the possibility that if there were live bees we might each get a hive out of it. We decided that if we did get hives, we would probably put them at Blue Heron or at the new Little Nancy Creek Park where I have asked that we be the beekeepers.The first hive was dead and empty of everything. All of the wax had been eaten out by wax moths. New wax had been built in the hives but it was abandoned. There were wax moth cocoons under the inner cover and the hive was dead. Probably the original bees had died and a swarm moved in (making the new wax) and then either absconded or died as well.
1887 “Mind you stay together, you lot! Make sure you’re back before it gets dark and don’t go far! You hear?” “Yes, Mam,” echoed the trio of children huddled around the door of the small terraced house before setting off down the street and making their way to the lane leading up to Sky Pond, their tongues wagging and jam jars clanging when their clogs made contact with the cobblestones. Half way up the lane, the mood changed as the rules for the afternoon were laid down. “We don’t want any whinging from you, our Gracie!” the tallest boy snapped, pointing a bony finger into the chest of the frail-looking girl in front of him. His other arm lay limply by his side. “If me and our Bunny find a docker and want to share it, we will. If you go telling our mam, we’ll have yer guts fer garters!” “I know better than to tell me mam, Alan,” Gracie snapped back at him. “I’ve still got the bruises from last time!” “Right then. Don’t say I haven’t warned yer.“ “Don’t think Gracie should be going up Hades on her own. It might rain,” the younger boy quipped hesitantly. “It might rain? It might bloody rain? Listen, soft lad, it might rain every blinking day! Like our dad says, if it ain’t raining it’s just about to!” The face of the younger brother flashed as red as his hair and Gracie came to his aid. “Don’t worry about me, Bunny. I’ll be fine. I only want to go up t’stones and dance with the fairies fer a few minutes. I’ll be straight back down,” she bent down to his level and gave him a reassuring smile. Bunny gave her a reluctant one in return. “Yer can come with me, if yer want?” Gracie added, wide-eyed. “He not going chasing fairies, ” proclaimed Alan sarcastically. “He’ll turn into one -– he’s already half way there! He’s coming with me -– I need him ter help me catch the taddies.” Bunny’s face crumpled when he heard Alan’s words. He wiped his nose across the sleeve of his threadbare jumper several times and then hitched up his short patched trousers. “Right, make yersel’ scarce, Gracie,” ordered Alan, walking on and dragging Bunny by his clean sleeve. “Up ter top, five minutes and straight back down to meet us by t’pond.” “Righty ho,” said Gracie, breaking away from them and giving Bunny a wave. “An’ don’t be late!” shouted Alan. “Or I’ll...” “Have me guts fer garters!” shouted Gracie, pulling a funny face that only Bunny caught sight of. She started running, laughing with excitement as she did so and occasionally turned around to watch the minute figures of Alan and Bunny trotting off in the opposite direction towards the deep black sparkle of Sky Pond. Part way up, Gracie lost sight of her brothers and sat down on the gorse and heather-clad hillside and surveyed the mill town at its foot. The crowd of smoking giant chimneys of the cotton mills below reminded her of the dragon that St. George must have fought in the pace egg play. She shuddered. It was no secret how hard it was in those mills. Her older sister Katie had aged years since she’d started work there. And now that Gracie was ten, she only had a couple of months to go before she would join her, as Alan’s gammy arm had prevented him from taking his turn first. She wished she could be like Miss Annabella Templeton and go to school until she was grown up, or be a doll like Lady Caroline Theawicke! Mind you, she didn’t want the curse that Lady Caroline had to live with, no way! She would rather be friends with fairies than devils! Perhaps Ma Crabtree was right when she’d read her mam’s tea leaves last week. “There will be no mill for Gracie!” Maybe she would be lucky and fall for a job as a servant instead? A dark cloud passed overhead and Gracie looked up. Bunny was right, it looked like rain. She smiled when she noticed the full moon in the afternoon light -– there would be fairies today -– definitely! She ran on gaily. --- Panic swept the whole street. Men stood on the corners talking earnestly, women sobbed silently so as to not scare the children. They were all scared though. Every last one of them. Young Grace Regan had gone missing up on Hades Hill and her brothers claimed she was away with the fairies! Ma Crabtree believed them, as did many of the older members of the community, such as Fanny Parkinson who had gone through the tor ring backwards when she had failed to conceive after eight years of marriage. Ma had told her what to do and her belly had been full within the year. Fanny’s child had the ability to see things others couldn’t, too, just like Ma. Ma waited for the knock at the door -– she knew they would come. When the hilltop had been searched and no body had been discovered, they would seek her out and she would tell them what they already knew but didn’t want to believe -– not yet. After a while, she knew they would want to believe it for anything would be better than thinking the child was dead. Mind you, she had seen it in the cups and had told the mother that there would be no mill for Gracie! The mother had taken it that another occupation would call instead, but Ma had a good idea at the time that it had something to do with the stones. She hadn’t expected them to take the child away though, it had been a long time since that had happened. Since before her time. The knock came, just as she knew it would. She put the kettle on and answered the door. They already knew where Gracie had gone, but they had to hear it from someone else, someone who knew about these things. Next Prev 1967 Elizabeth ran down Market Street and turned into Cotton Row. She needed to be quick -– super quick. Her mother knew exactly how long it should take her to do the errand. Even if there was a queue in the Co-op it should not take more than twenty minutes, any longer and she would be straight after her. She looked up at the grey stone building. All the previous times she had passed it she had never paid it much attention. Funny that, because the building looked just like something out of a fairytale. It was so easy to imagine Rapunzel sitting at the turreted window. From where Elizabeth stood, she could clearly see two entrances. She much preferred the grand entrance with the door that looked as though it belonged to a castle, but her granddad had specifically said that she should go in the side one. Elizabeth was fascinated by the stained glass in the window of the side entrance door. She could make out angels, flowers and animals. She wished she had the time to look at it in more detail but she didn’t have a second to spare. Breathless she rushed inside. Elizabeth stared hard. The man standing before her looked like a real live angel! He even sounded like tiny chimes; she was positive that the vague tinkling she could hear was coming from him. She studied him closely. His long blond hair fell loosely to his shoulders, like Prince Charming in her storybooks at home. This must be the “Tash fellow” her granddad had told her she might see. She continued to stare wide eyed and panic started to rise in her. There was no way she was going to get the words out in time, make it to the shop, and make it back home again. There was no way! “Don’t be frightened,” Tashriel said, walking towards her. I don’t bite. He smiled and Elizabeth continued to stare. She felt him touch her on the shoulder. “Is that better?” “Yes, thank you,” she heard herself say, gasping for breath. “I’ll have to be quick, I’ve only got ten minutes to tell you and I have got to get to the shop and back home. I think I’ve used nine minutes already! My mum will go mad if I’m late back and...,” she stopped for breath as he raised his hand. “No need to worry, Elizabeth, there is plenty of time. I promise you that you will be home with minutes to spare.” Elizabeth blinked several times and continued staring. He really was very pretty. “So, now that we know why you are here, and...” “But I haven’t told you yet!” Elizabeth interrupted. “I’ve got a message for you from me granddad and...” “Yes I know,” Tashriel replied softly. “I knew what your message was as soon as you came in and I asked a friend of mine to go and fetch your granddad and meet us both here. We’ve been searching for your granddad for a long time and now he has found us again. He’s waiting for us with my friend Stanley in another room. Come with me.” He held his hand out to her and Elizabeth placed her small one within it. “Let’s go and join them and have some tea.” --- Lady Mabel Theawicke watched as the child and Tashriel left the red reception room at RoYds. “It will be for the best if you stay away from Elizabeth from now on,” she remarked, looking sternly at the man sitting in front of the fireplace with Stanley. Billy nodded. He could still feel the weight of the child on his lap where she had been sitting earlier. It was almost like she had left a little imprint on his presence. He sighed. He liked the kid, she had done him a big favour, but he didn’t need her any more. Besides, he had to go back before midnight. That was the bargain with Annwn and he had no choice but to stick with it. “So, you have no idea what happened to your body, only that it’s somewhere in the dell?” Stanley asked, passing Billy a cigarette and lighting it for him. Billy inhaled deeply. By heck that’s grand “Should imagine so,” replied Billy offhandedly looking off into space and then back at Stanley. “I’m not mithered, you know. It makes no difference to me. Unless some fucking hopper’s running about in it! I shouldn’t imagine it though? You would have heard about that by now if they was, wouldn’t you?” Stanley nodded. “Well then, best it stays where it is. It’s obviously well hidden. I’ve no need for it either. I suspect after all these years the earth has already reclaimed it. Best thing all round if you ask me.” “So,” Stanley said, sitting forward in his seat. “This Gorgeous George bloke knocked you on the side of the head with some kind of object and that was it? No light, eh? And the next thing you know you are wandering around the dell twenty years later?” “That’s about it,” Billy answered, taking a final drag on his cigarette and throwing it into the fire. “He died in an accident if I remember correctly,” Lady Mabel looked across to Stanley for confirmation. “Yes, he did. Car crash I think... Obviously, we took a great deal of interest in that outfit after your disappearance, Billy. We knew something had happened to you and that the answers lay with the Living. Never able to get to the bottom of it, mind you. The conclusion was that you had gone directly into the light.” “Aye, well who knows! Probably would have done, given half the chance! Anything would have been a damned site better than that place I ended up in!” Billy shivered and gazed blankly at his knees. Stanley reached out and patted his shoulder. “I remember he married Cora Woods and they had quite a handful of children. They seemed to be a good match as far as I could,” announced Lady Mabel as much to herself as anyone else. “Well, thankfully all that’s over now and a new dawn has begun.” quipped Stanley cheerfully. Billy looked up and directed his question at Lady Mabel. “Elizabeth told me that...my...Anne died in 1952?” “Yes, that’s correct,” replied the Lady Mabel, walking over to him, her long grey skirts rustling. “Did she...did she ever marry again?” The mask of Lady Mabel’s normally emotionless face cracked a little and her cornflower blue eyes held those of Billy’s firmly. “No. Anne never loved any man but you, Billy.” Billy wiped away budding tear drops from his own eyes with the back of his hand. “Aye. I loved her and all that,” he sobbed and then faded away. Next Prev 1967 Billy watched idly as the little old woman continued to laboriously bend and pick up the few dry birch twigs that were scattered around the clearing. Each stoop seemed to require twice as much effort than the last. So far, her daily foraging did not look to have been very successful. He looked up to the sky; the morning was quickly drawing in, he doubted that she would have the quantity of firewood she required to see her comfortably through the next day. Billy looked towards his own pile. It had taken a strapping bloke like him half the night to come up with a bounty like that. She had no chance! Billy watched as she struggled to tie her small bundle together. Her hands were chapped, the fingers knotted with age. He tensed as the bushes around him rustled and a little white terrier with one red ear emerged from the undergrowth and padded up to him. He bent down to pat it and delighted with the dog’s enthusiastic response, continued to make a fuss of it. “Calm down now, lad,” he said playfully, and stood up fully again. The dog reminded him of his own dog, Monty. He hadn’t seen Monty since...he couldn’t remember when. He looked over to where the old woman had been scavenging. She had moved on a bit, although her bundle of twigs had not grown any larger. Billy had seen the old woman on many occasions but he had never seen the dog before. “Best get gone now,” he ordered the dog. The dog splayed out on his belly and wagged his tail. Billy smiled despite himself. “What’s up with you? Eh...soft lad,” he said, unable to resist bending down and making another fuss of it. The old woman had turned around and was catching up the distance between them. Billy noticed a dejected air about her and sighed. Grabbing a large amount of his own prized firewood, he ran over to her, the dog following behind. “Here,” he said, cheerfully thrusting the wood in the old woman’s direction. “Yer may as well ‘ave this lot as well!” --- “See that tree?” Elizabeth looked over to where her mother was pointing and squinting through the sunshine, and peered closely at the very boring tree situated in the tiny garden beyond the graveyard they were standing in. Elizabeth nodded. My dad planted that tree when I was not much bigger than you are now. In fact, I might have been even younger. He took the pip from an apple I had eaten and planted it in the garden. “‘One day,’ he’d said, ‘There’ll be a tree here even bigger than the house.’ And we both laughed. Every time I see that tree I think of my dad. Some people believe that as long as a person is remembered, they never die.” Margaret smiled down at Elizabeth and ruffled her hair. Elizabeth looked at the colourful flowers carefully arranged in the vase beside the black marble headstone and the names carved upon it. 1952, that was in the olden days! Her mother must have been very young when her mum had died. Elizabeth felt sad thinking about it. “We’ll call in there and have a nice cup of tea with Mrs Bibby, shall we? See how she is?” Margaret said encouragingly to Elizabeth. “If you’re a good girl, we can call and have a toasted teacake for tea at the Myna Bird Cafe!” Elizabeth smiled brightly and skipped along the cobbled rake leading down from the graveyard and into the town square. --- Elizabeth concentrated on not staring at the grey whiskers on Mrs Bibby’s chin. It would be such a disaster if she missed out on a visit to see the Myna bird. “Why don’t you go and play outside, dearie? It’s such a lovely day and plenty of juicy apples have fallen off that tree today. Have a look and see if any of them are worth taking home with you!” “Yes, Mrs Bibby,” she said in her best voice and skipped out of the tiny kitchen into the garden beyond. Most of the apples had tiny worms in them. Elizabeth giggled to herself; the worms always looked so funny wriggling about. Her dad always told her it was because apples were used to make cider and the worms were drunk. The warmer the day, the drunker the worms! These ones were steaming. Nobody likes me Everybody hates me “I think I’ll go and eat worms!” Elizabeth sang out. Big fat juicy ones Eensie weensy squeensy ones “See how they wiggle and squirm!” Elizabeth giggled. “What’s your name?” “I’m not supposed to talk to strangers!” Elizabeth pouted at the man sitting on the grass beside her. “I’m not really a stranger.” Elizabeth tilted her head to one side. “Well, in that case, if you’re not a stranger, you tell me my name!” she said cheekily. The man laughed. “You got me there! Is that your mum in there? I think that’s your mum in there because that’s my girl -– that’s my little girl...Maggie.” He answered looking through the kitchen widow and gazing into the room beyond. “Not so!” Elizabeth said standi
g up and putting her hands on her hips. “That’s my mummy and her name’s Margaret, NOT Maggie!” She stuck her tongue out at him and then screwed up her face. “So there!” The stranger also got up onto his feet. “Margaret is her Sunday name but she was always my Maggie. See this tree here?” Elizabeth nodded wide eyed. “Well, I planted this tree when it were a little tiny seed like this one here,” he said, picking up another apple and plucking the seed from it. “If you want, we can plant this seed over here and when you grow up it will be bigger than this house!” He walked over to the far corner of the garden and waited for her to join him. “My name is Elizabeth,” she announced gaily. “What’s yours?” “Billy. You can call me granddad if you want.” Elizabeth smiled and nodded. “Elizabeth’s a Sunday name. How about I call you our Bess? ” Next Prev Refuge of Delayed Souls Ebooks are Free during Read an Ebook Week which runs from 7 - 10 March 2010 Use Coupon Code RFREE at the checkout.

Heard say now the war is over there’s other places more suited to what they need. Heard they didn’t much like it anyways, spooked by the dell. Its inhabitants more like -- after all those scare-stories we’ve been spreading round!” Raucous laughter spread throughout the pub like wildfire. Billy looked at his cards. He could win this round. Switch, the twenty stone King of Crime, was in a good mood for a change. Billy put out his cigarette and took a sip of his pint. “It’ll work out well for storage and also be a good place to hang out when the heat’s on. That swine Allen’s still got a face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle despite all the readies we’re bunging him. Heard he has quite a grudge against you, Billy -– been shagging his wife or summat?” Blade asked, throwing a ten shilling note into the pot of coins and notes already on the table. The infectious laughter echoed around the room and Billy joined in. He didn’t mind being the brunt of it, not tonight anyway. Not when he was on a winning streak. He placed his aces on the table. “Not yet!” he said coolly and lit a fresh cigarette. Switch studied him keenly and then burst out laughing. “Not yet! Not bloody yet! I like his style!” He pushed the money in the pot over to Billy and then continued in a more serious tone, “What’s he got against you, Billy? Apart from the fact that you are a lying, cheating little shit.” Switch leaned in and held Billy’s gaze a fraction longer than necessary. “But then again -– aren’t we all?” he quipped, leaning back and pulling his braces forward. The room exploded once more. Billy casually collected his winnings off the table and put them in his inside jacket pocket. He made a mental note to give Ann a bob or two of it to spend on herself and the kiddies. That was if he had any left after he had finished paying his dues and put aside what he needed for his fags, beers and bets next week. He drained his glass and passed it to the vivacious Cora who, as usual, was hovering enticingly nearby. “A few year back I gave his mother one,” replied Billy in a deadpan manner, inhaling deeply on his cigarette and blowing a smoke circle into the room. Switch actually looked like he believed him. “I’ve no idea,” he added quickly with half a smile. “He’s just a nasty piece of work.” “You can say that again,” said Gorgeous George from where he stood, leaning against the bar leering at Cora as she walked past with her hands full of dirty glasses. Billy ogled Cora too. Been there “Right, gentleman! Time to say good night and thanks for donating to the House of Lawrence. Same time, same place, tomorrow.” Billy kicked his chair back and stood up. “Not tomorrow,” Switch looked up at him. “I want you to deliver that last load down to the Nayes. Have it there for 10:00 p.m. Mark my words now, lad.” Billy nodded and walked away, stopping briefly on his way out to have a quiet word and squeeze with Cora at the bar. The opportunity to mark his territory was too tempting for Billy to resist. --- The road leading down to Staibey Nayes was accessed from the far side of town. It was tree lined, had no street lights and was wide enough for only a single vehicle to manoeuvre at any one time. The road continued for about three-quarters of a mile and to a stranger would seem to come to an end in a wood which appeared on the horizon beyond. A local, however, knew that just before the end of the road was reached, it branched off to the right and opened onto a building complex. During the war, the entrance to the complex had been barred by a gated sentry box which had been manned by two fully armed security guards at any one time. Tonight, though, the gate was open and the chain and padlock were tossed to the side of the road. The buildings had existed centuries before the war. For a period of time before war broke out, they had served as a depot for the engines which carried the stone through the dell from the quarries above. Prior to that, they were warehouses for the cloth made in the cotton mills close by and before that still, a local wool merchant had built his mansion here. Ever since records began, there had been buildings in the location of Staibey Nayes. Billy had learned that at school when they had been taught about the Doomsday Book. Billy expected to get a good cut from tonight’s load. He had no compunction about fuelling the black market. After all, they were only supplying a demand and someone had to do it. If it wasn’t them it would be someone else. Billy had expected to see other vehicles in the empty quadrant. He pulled up and parked the stolen lorry, and then checked his watch: 21:55. There was still time for a cigarette. He opened the cab door of the lorry and stepped outside into the cold night air. After transferring his cigarettes and matches into his trouser pocket, he threw his jacket and scarf back inside the cab despite the chill. The wind blew up and whistled through the trees, carrying the sweet scent of night blossoms and the call of an owl. Billy tried to decipher which part of the dell the sound had come from. The silhouette of the leafless trees against the raw black and twinkling night sky caught his attention and he leaned his head back and tried to decipher his favourite constellation, the Plough. The moment was spoilt when the door of the building to his right was opened and Gorgeous George waved him over. Both men worked up a sweat carrying the cargo from the lorry into the building where Gorgeous had been waiting. Billy also worked up quite a temper. He was raging that no one else had been there to help them. He wasn’t anyone’s fucking monkey! Switch should know better than to waste his time and sweat on shifting this crap. Eventually, the job was done and Billy followed Gorgeous back into the building to collect his earnings for the night’s hard work. He couldn’t wait to get his hands on that wad of cash! Gorgeous walked through the former office where they had stacked the goods and into the one beyond, where Billy could see a black holdall resting on a makeshift desk. Billy lit himself a well-deserved cigarette and as he waited for Gorgeous to get the money together, he walked over to the window to continue his earlier aborted search for the Plough. Fuck He threw his cigarette on the floor and stomped it out viciously. Standing against a dry stone wall near to the parked lorry below was a young woman in a red coat, looking up at him. Shocked, he watched dumbfounded as she turned and seemed to be intent on something that was happening in the dell beyond. Billy turned to let Gorgeous know about their unexpected visitor and felt the impact of a heavy metal object. Billy fell to the ground and into a vicious kick from the boot of Gorgeous George. “Not so fucking handsome now, are you, Billy Boy?” --- Billy was in the water, Charlie was crying out in the distance. Billy swam out to meet him. again and again Peg stood between Billy and Michael, her eyes wide and pleading. Billy lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. again and again Cora moaned softly into Billy’s ear, her breasts pressed tightly against his chest. Anne walked in and caught them. again and again Billy treaded water as the incendiaries came down and screams echoed around him. You’re going to Hell, Lawrence “I’m already fucking there!” He screamed. Next Prev 2008 “Linus Howell,” announced Stanley perplexed. “I would recognise him anywhere,” said Elizabeth with an involuntary shudder. It was the first time they had all been together in one place for as long as Elizabeth could remember. Stanley had gathered together his war cabinet. The group of them were crowded around a large circular table in the red reception room at RoYds. Wilfred was busying stacking coals on the already roaring fire behind them. “Kelly Crabtree is sitting in a classroom up at the college and all of his other victims are walking around as large as... life, ” added Paul. “It’s as if his crimes never happened! Of course we know differently, but somehow Howell, or someone... something else, has managed to bewitch the Living into believing otherwise.” Elizabeth noted the concerned looks around the room before shifting her attention towards Gemma who had placed herself in between Tashriel and Grispheran. Much to Elizabeth’s annoyance, the latter was sitting sideways against the table his own attention also focussed firmly upon Gemma who was flirting with him outlandishly. “Then there is only one explanation I can offer,” said Stanley, lighting a cigar. “Whatever Ed Lord uncovered up at Heyleigh Stones has magical properties. It would appear that we need to recover it and return it to where it belongs without further delay. “Agreed,” said Tashriel almost as if he was speaking for all of them. Lady Mabel leaned forward, placed her elbows on the table and the palms of her hands together as if in prayer. When she had everyone’s attention, including Gemma and Grispheran’s, she spoke with authority. “The last time something like this happened...” “Was in 1946 when we first lost poor Mr Lawrence,” interrupted Wilfred standing up from the fireplace and walking towards them. “Ah, Wilfred,” said Stanley twisting in his chair and looking over his shoulder to get a view of him. “Would you like to join us?” he nodded towards the empty chair beside Paul. The coal dust disappeared from Wilfred’s hands as he joined them at the table and produced a delicious looking display of cakes upon a silver platter. “Mr Lawrence?” asked Elizabeth quizzically. “ Billy Lawrence?” “The very one, Miss,” confirmed Wilfred. “I did have a soft spot for Mr Lawrence, Miss. Dare say he reminded me of myself in some ways...” “Quite,” said Stanley in an attempt to bring them back on track again. “We can’t talk about that little episode now -– we haven’t got time. By the way, has anyone actually noticed the time by any chance?” All eyes focussed on the Edwardian clock ticking merrily upon the black marble mantelpiece. “What about it?” asked Gemma. “The clock looks to be working fine to me.” “Always does, Miss,” replied Wilfred reassuringly. “Then what are we looking at?” questioned Paul. “11 a.m.,” announced Archie solemnly. “And totally dark outside!” Next Prev 1946 The safe job had been easy enough. Billy was aware that the police suspected he had been involved somehow. He also knew that if they could, they would fit him up for just about anything. The newly promoted Sergeant Allen in particular was a nasty piece of work. Takes one to know one Switch had been fair with Billy up until now, so he had no complaints. He had initially misjudged Gorgeous George and Dan the Man -– they were a bit barmy, mean to be sure, but not bad with it. You knew where you were with them and the consequences of crossing them, he could handle that. So far, there had been the one explosives job, a few lorry heists and a huge amount of black market profiteering. His little side job with RoYds was proving to be a good number too -– money for old rope. He wondered what they had in store for him this time as he walked up to the now familiar open oak door and stepped inside. “Afternoon, Mr Lawrence. Dark out isn’t it?” Wilfred never changed. Billy wished he would take the stick out from up his arse and cut the brownnosing. “Stanley in?” he asked, throwing Wilfred his coat and starting off down the passageway. “As a matter of fact, Sir, Lady Mabel would like a word with you this morning. You will find her in the office, Sir, first door on the left.” Lady Mabel! He had yet to have the pleasure! He whistled merrily to himself as he continued down the opulent cobalt blue-decorated corridor and waltzed into the more practical office, usually reserved for unsuspecting members of the Living who required the services of RoYds. --- “You want me to what?” Billy snarled, closing the distance between them. “Where the hell do you get the idea that I would do something like that? What do you think I am -– your lap-dog?” He was furious. Jumped up little tart Billy stopped thinking when his back slapped against the wall behind him and his head smashed up against the ceiling. A split second later the door slammed furiously open and shut leaving him alone in the room. He looked down, the view was just like he suspected it would be from this angle -– not that he had ever given it much thought, mind you. He would probably break a bone or two if he just fell to the floor and said a silent prayer that whatever power was keeping him up would let him down slowly. Tashriel appeared in the room below and Billy found himself standing by his side. “Silver.” “What?” Asked Billy exasperatedly, brushing the plaster from his made-to-measure navy suit and exercising his neck in an attempt to ease the newly acquired crick in it. “Silver. Offers no protection against your own kind, but if you carry some on your person, Lady Mabel -- and other factions -- will not be able to harm you. I doubt Lady Mabel intended you any real harm. You are still breathing.” Smarmy pretty boy “And who would you be then?” Billy replied sarcastically. “Someone she just mistook me for?” “I could always put you back up there if you prefer,” Tashriel volunteered, looking up at the space Billy had so recently occupied. Calmer now, Billy considered Tashriel’s offer. “Er...no thanks!” He pulled a packet of cigarettes from his inside pocket and helped himself to one before offering the packet to Tashriel. “I know that Stanley enjoys a fag,” he said hesitatively. Tashriel politely declined. “What was it about Lady Mabel’s request that enraged you?” “I’m no cold blooded murderer!” snapped Billy in reply, removing the lit cigarette from his mouth. “Seems to me that witch is quite capable of doing the deed herself!” Tashriel sighed, “As I said, keep something silver on you at all times to prevent it happening in future. Better still, try to get control of your temper.” Something about Tashriel’s tone brought Billy to his senses. “Aye. Suppose you’re right.” “Besides, you are simply being asked to contain a situation,” Tashriel remarked casually. “The real John Sweeney is already dead -– your role is merely to evict the entity that is squatting in his body. --- It had been drizzling all day, perhaps all week, he couldn’t remember. Billy wondered if it would ever stop and, upon further consideration, whether it was possible for an entire town to weep. Personally, he had no time for tears. As far as he was concerned, they would not serve any purpose and only distract from the job at hand. He buttoned up his navy overcoat, pulling the collar up as far as possible as he did so. Casting his eyes down towards the grey flagstone pavement, he took the identity of a grey man amongst other grey people. The house was straight ahead. It was not his first visit here; he had recce’d the place on several occasions at various times of the day and night. He knew exactly where he was heading -– some would say straight to Hell. He had no doubt that he would be on the guest list if such a place existed. Nearly there now, he unbuttoned his overcoat, turned off his wandering thoughts and went into autopilot mode. He knocked on the door and it was answered almost immediately.
What?!?! MORE cupcakes? Where are the drawings and sewings and art, Alicia?' you say.'Psshaw!' say I. ' I HAD to make them! They're brain slugs. I have no choice.'And so this past weekend, I made some Futurama brain slug cupcakes for a birthday celebration. We needed something that could travel to the pub, be delicious, be to the birthday boy's liking in terms of content, and fairly quick and easy to make, just like last year's Zappa Utility Muffins.I opted to make the brain slugs themselves from gum paste, with royal icing eyes, and flower stamen antennae that I attempted to dye green with food coloring (and very vaguely succeeded in doing so). They are vanilla cupcakes from scratch, with some slightly grenadine flavored buttercream icing brains. And they were as tasty as the sweet, sweet fluids the brain slugs crave themselves!
because you can never have too much yarn porn. january 1, i started a 365 photo-a-day project. and, in consultation with many of your good selves, i created a&nbsp; flickr group &nbsp;to support it and for us to have a place to share our photos and give feedback to one another, with the idea of improving our photography. in the initial, heady days of january, it was so much fun! it seemed like the year would fly by and the inspiration would continue to flow like a fountain. all these people who knew one another from the blogosphere and a few new ones joined in and we became friends. and everyone learned and made explore and was happy. then february struck. most of those in the group live in the northern hemisphere, so it was the darkest, coldest, most dreary part of the winter and it was hard. now it's march and spring is taking its sweet time in coming, at least where i live. there are days when i look outside at the aging snowbanks and the bare trees and i think, "i can't possibly take a &nbsp;picture of anything worthwhile today." but then i take a wander around the house or i look at the photos the others in the group have taken and i feel inspired by something someone else photographed, and i get through it. because i promised myself i would. and my promises to myself have to mean something. and you reach a point where you keep doing it BECAUSE it's hard and because doing things that are hard can be good for you, and because it makes you buy fresh flowers on a regular basis. my reasons for doing this have already changed in the 75 days it's been running. at the beginning, if i'm &nbsp;honest, i wanted to show off my ability to take breathtaking pictures and develop more consistency in that. now, i realize that such a project is more about documenting what's going on in my life. and i admit that it's most decidedly not breathtaking on a daily basis. some days, i use my iPhone (thank goodness i've got&nbsp; hipstamatic and camerabag and other apps to make that more interesting). when the weather gets good, i'm going to use some of my film cameras (they're best at outdoor photos). i realized that a profound macro of the inside of my cat's ear doesn't actually help me document my life on a daily basis, so i've worked at pushing myself away from those and towards things that will help me remember what was going on and what was important to me at a particular moment in time. i think ultimately i'll find that this project is about memory for me. the other reason i did this was to be more mindful of the world around me. to notice things. to see differently. last year at about this time, i got on a total eyeball kick , which i later realized was about my wanting to SEE differently. having to take a photo every day makes me look differently at the world. i'll admit it's hard for me not to see the current exodus from the group as a personal rejection of sorts, despite endless explanations to the contrary, but i'm trying. and until i can forget about it, that's all i can do.in the meantime, it makes me quite sad to see people give up and leave us, whatever their reasons. but although i'll admit it shakes my conviction, especially because it's people i love and respect, i remain committed. after all, i read recently about a guy who took a picture every single day from 1979 'til his death in 1997. now THAT's commitment. if you're not now totally put off the idea of taking a photo every day and you'd like to join us, please check out the blog camp 365 group on flickr. it's never too late to start! - - - and the picture at the top? what does it have to do with all of this? well, it was one of THOSE days, where i took what felt like 600 pictures of the new yarn that i'm going to use to make granny squares after kristina and ulrika teach me this coming weekend, and i wasn't pleased with how any of them turned out. but then, i played with them in lightroom and i think this one came out ok. a process that was good for me and which framboesa talks about very thoughtfully here . yesterday, in the flickr group, kristine had a shot of her passport and used it to tell the story of how she was soon moving on to her next assignment. i didn't have any idea what i was going to do for my photo, so i did one of those tribute shots , as they're called when you blatantly copy what someone did and give them credit. i located my old passport and my current one and, as can often be the case with these daily photos, took a little trip down memory lane. old on the left, current on the right my passports are fatter than your usual passport. and that's because both of them have had pages added to them. twice. you'll also notice that my old passport was green. it was my first one and i didn't know that most americans have a blue one. i was "lucky" and got the green one during a very small window when they issued ben franklin commemorative passports. it's actually thanks to benjamin franklin that we all have passports at all, as it was his idea. the unusual green passport caused me no end of grief when i was traveling a lot in the balkans in the late 90s. border guards constantly questioned its authenticity and one guard at the turkish-greek border actually said, "green passport, very bad, very bad," and made a slicing motion across his neck. i was quite alarmed, but the conversation stopped there as that was apparently the extent of his english and my turkish was nonexistent. i've survived to tell the tale, so i guess it wasn't really very bad. and i never did ever meet anyone else with a green one. as an american, you get stamped everywhere you go and you often need visas. the first passport filled up because the macedonian visa took a whole page every time and i had to have a new one if i popped down to thessaloniki for a weekend or up to belgrade for a coffee. it was early days after macedonia found themselves, rather to their surprise, with their own country, and it took them awhile to realize they could issue multiple-entry visas. i eventually got one of those, but not before they had used up ten pages of my passport. a number of countries - china and india come to mind - think nothing of taking up an entire page of your passport for the visa. and the visas are elaborately colorful and often feature shiny holograms. i guess they want you to feel you got your money's worth. on the bright side, they're usually good for a least six months, so you don't need a new one should you be sent those places again. &nbsp;i did use up two whole pages on indian visas, as i had to go there frequently enough that one expired and i needed another. (audible sigh.) the bulk of my travel occurred during the bush administration and i clearly remember standing in lines at passport control, concealing my passport, as i felt a little sheepish about being american during those years. i happened to be in the philippines when obama was elected and i very clearly remember the sense of relief (tho' bush was still president) when i realized that i no longer had to hide my passport while i stood in line. on that occasion, people in line saw it and several actually smiled and gave me a thumbs up. with the incomprehensible debacle of health care reform (who would seriously not want to limit the influence of insurance companies on their personal health?) going on in the US right now, i'm not sure i wouldn't actually begin to conceal my passport again if i were queuing today. many of the pages are covered in stamps that say "københavn" because i get stamped every time i come back into the country if it's not from scandinavia or the schengen countries. it tapered off because eventually, i knew all of the guys at passport control and convinced them to not to stamp me every time. i've loved the travel opportunities i've had through my various jobs. the job i'm starting in april will not have so many travel opportunities, but i've been thinking about it and i'm really ok with that. looking at all of these stamps exhausts me a little bit. when i see the dates for the convoluted trip i took from copenhagen to singapore to heathrow to gatwick to budapest to constanza and back to copenhagen in one crazy week, it makes me tired. i hope companies today are using the possibilities afforded by electronic meeting software, rather than sending someone to give a 30 minute presentation in singapore on monday and the same one in romania on wednesday. i remember thinking it was all very exciting at the time (tho' having to switch from heathrow to gatwick was madness and an example of how bad the travel agent was). but today, i wouldn't even want to do it. and i would probably have the good sense to say no, but in those days (sounds like long ago, but it's not even three years ago), i actually quite liked it and of course, felt i had to do all of the things that were asked of me. these stamps document for me how far i've come not just literally, but metaphorically as well. i think i've learned to say no to such madness today. and i hope that one good thing to come out of economic crisis is that employees aren't asked to do trips like that these days, because companies think twice before spending 40,000 ($7,300) kroner on such a ticket. i'm going to lose my gold status on both SAS and KLM here in the next couple of months. and tho' there was a time, not so long ago, when that would have panicked me, i'm resting quite easily in the knowledge. the world is changing and times are changing and it's no longer environmentally defensible to pop over to london for lunch or take a private plane back from newcastle like we did in the mid-noughties. i loved those times and am grateful for all the places i've been, but i'm quite ready to stay a bit closer to home for awhile. and besides, taking the train down through europe is quite romantic. ~ i miss being in an academic environment. i miss the thrill of reading a really dense sentence and pulling meaning out of it that applies the world around me. i think it's why i used quotes from susan sontag's on photography on my 365 project photos during february . ~ husband looks like an entirely new person in his new glasses (must photograph him soon). but is it the glasses or his new job or our impending move giving him that glow? maybe it's all of it. ~ i learned that our new little samsung U10 HD flashcam can't really handle filming in the dimly-lit riding hall. ~ note: the flashcam doesn't violate the "not buying things in 2010" because i actually bought it back in december, but my sister only just sent it last week. ~ cleaning out the attic is like visiting a flea market and finding all kinds of treasures, only without spending any money. who knew we had all this cool stuff? ~ if you trip over a sweet little brass deer in the yard at a house you're contemplating, it's a sign, right? and if you accidentally take that little deer with you, it's not really stealing, right? since it was abandoned out in the yard at a house that stands empty? ~ one drawback of sunshine: it exposes just how much your windows need cleaning. ~ stieg larsson is sweden's answer to dan brown. only we won't be subjected to more of his hack writing since he died. but i'll admit that i like the characters of mikael blomqvist and lisbeth salander, so i (re)read on. sometimes, you just have to read trash. but arthur koestler's the ghost in the machine is next on my nightstand, so i shall redeem myself. ~ every day after husband and sabin leave, i think that i'll go back to bed, but i never do. and soon, i won't be able to, since i'll be headed off for work in an actual office myself. ~ sometimes i wonder if others can hear that ringing in my ears. ~ i packed marxism and theology books in the same box this weekend and wondered aloud if i would be going to hell for that (tho' thankfully i cannot, since i don't believe in hell and it's like santa claus, if you don't believe it in, it doesn't believe in you (thanks gwen )). husband's response: "god is more of a marxist than you think." and the more we discussed it, the more i think he's right, there is something of the new testament over the communist manifesto . i wish i'd written my dissertation on that. of course, i still could, since i haven't actually written it. yet. ~ i tucked all those little end bits of yarn into my scarf last night while watching hercule poirot (who is so gay, by the way, not that there's anything wrong with that). it was much easier than i thought it would be. now i hope i can figure out how to join the ends together when the time comes to do that. ~ i really wish i was on my way to the bookstore with trinsch &nbsp;this morning. she's going to browse books on new media and then she gets to write about it. i'm so envious. it leaves me positively longing for academia. ~ i do love these little random thought downloads, they just completely clear my head and leave me feeling ready to face the week. pondering happiness quite a lot in the face of the excitement of moving to the other side of the country (which admittedly is like moving from one side of wisconsin to the other and not as big as it might sound). husband is like a little kid anticipating christmas. he actually fell asleep last night with a smile on his face. he's covering reams of paper with sketches of the possibilities for renovations. we're now betting on two horses, as it were, and have given an offer on a second place, since the dog sled transport to northern canada is apparently unreliable, or else the laid back realtor hasn't actually sent a dog sled or any thing else, as we've heard nothing regarding our first offer. not being ones to wait around, husband has now talked himself (and thereby both of us) into the second place being better anyway. and he's right, there are more possibilities for ripping out everything that's there and putting it back in as we would want it. now betting on this one as well. what's cool is that there's a lake on the property. and although the first thing it needs is a new roof, that does afford opportunities not afforded by the other place, which recently had a new roof, although the engineering calculations surrounding that new roof are openly suspect in several places. so i think husband is right, the second property is better for us anyway. but my point actually is that even just talking about all of this is making us so happy. leading me to think about what happiness is. it's an eternal question, isn't it? and we're eternally in search of happiness, tho' i'm not sure we always recognize it when we see it. for me, it's something different than contentment. contentment is a mild, tame form of happiness. a resting, easy thing. whereas, what i think makes us happy, makes us really tick, is having some enormous, seemingly impossible, daunting project on the horizon. i can definitely see that in husband. he's transformed and positively beaming at the prospect of this project. of course, it's also his new job that's transformed him - he was more than a little bored and frustrated at work and just going through the motions. he's looking forward to his new job, but even more, to the new house and all of the possibilities it represents. these projects also remind me of our strengths - i can see things in my mind and he can build them. i pick colors, he paints them. in other words, i get all the fun and he does all the work. i guess i'll probably spend another summer with no kitchen, cooking on an old stove out in the yard and eating lots of salads. maybe it'll be time to try that raw diet i've long wanted to try. perhaps it will clear my mind so that i'll make good choices on all of those colors that we'll need on the walls in the new house. whichever one it ends up being. at least the waiting paralysis of last week seems to have passed and an excited, expectant happiness has stepped in to replace it. and that makes me very happy. what made you happy this weekend? march 7 march 9 march 11 march 13 i'm especially pleased with that row of yellow. it's some yarn i bought last summer at the viking fair in roskilde. it's hand-dyed with natural plant dyes - gyldenris as it's called in danish (not sure what that is in english). &nbsp;the colors are slightly less vibrant than this in real life. i've got the saturation dialed up a notch (or two) in my camera at the moment. i shou
d have bought the entire basket of this yarn dyed with natural plant dyes - - - &nbsp;a big congratulations to molly , my very first follower, and long lost sister in south africa.&nbsp; she just had a beautiful baby girl. latte and a fabulous norwegian cinnamon bun for stephanie of concerning: pancakes . i'm back again already with another blog crush. i told you i had more of them brewing. this time, i'm utterly charmed by stephanie's blog, c oncerning: pancakes . you may remember her from my tagging her recently for 7 random things . and while i'm hoping she doesn't actually drink bud light with her peanut m&amp;m's, i very much enjoyed her list. stephanie first came to my attention because she has also decided to spend less in 2010 (tho' i do believe she's taking a bit of a break at the moment, kinda like i did with the infamous orange coat incident). but thanks to the LinkWithin widget (love it now that they improved the code and hence the speed), i also found out that she's got a TLR camera &nbsp;and likes to play with TtV photography. her cat, chairman meow , has a clever name and is cute as can be. she often blogs about cooking , which is always a plus in my book. i'm off to make her german pancakes now, since the pooka is home and feeling poorly. please do go check her out. around midmorning, right as i was putting the finishing touches on my to-do list, i got a monster headache. i blame the chocolate on toast that husband made me for breakfast. too much sugar, especially in the morning, will bring on a headache every time. it resisted all ibuprofen and the gallons of water i drank, so i finally took a nap. i couldn't even read, because it hurt too much to focus my eyes (there's that focus thing again). when sabin came home, i decided to hang out and watch project runway with her, despite the headache. while we watched the amusing catfighting and recriminations, &nbsp;i worked a bit on my knitting. and that's when i saw this little giraffe herd go by...do you think headaches can make you hallucinate? some snow melted, but not all. and hoarfrost on the trees. hurry up spring! we've been waiting and waiting all week. and we've realized that waiting bites. and instead of being productive and getting things done, the waiting paralyzes you and you stare into space and can't think straight and your arm falls asleep while you're knitting (is that supposed to happen?). you wander listlessly around the house, thinking about how much packing there is to do, but it doesn't really result in you actually doing any of it. Your mind wanders off to that dog sled that should have reached that guy you want to buy the house from wherever he is in the northern reaches of canada. you talked to the realtor yesterday, but he was as laid back as his accent and not at all worried that the guy hadn't answered yet. you asked in a slightly hysterical voice if they had in fact really sent a dog sled. he pretends he knows what you're talking about and laughs. it seems that your new job will start a whole lot sooner than you thought, which is both good and bad. because you haven't used your time all that wisely and now suddenly you won't have any. but on the other hand, it will undoubtedly be good for you to dress in normal clothes, fix your hair and put on makeup and go out among people on a daily basis. your photo-a-day project may suffer and focus rather too frequently on the wind turbine just outside your new office window. but time will tell. time will tell on all of it and time takes its sweet time. so strange how it can both crawl at a snail's pace and race by in the same instant. but time is mysterious that way. and life is full of contradictions.
Fifteen years ago, I was on my way to the Austin airport to catch a flight to New York City when the friend I’d be staying with called and said that we’d be attending a dance performance that evening in the East Village. Admission was free, she said, but the organizers requested a donation of two canned goods for a food pantry. So before walking out the door, I grabbed a couple of Ranch Style Beans as my offering. Ranch Style Beans are a Texan staple and they’ve been satisfying people since 1872 with their take on classic chuck-wagon fare. It’s a distinctive flavor—the beans aren’t fiery but they do have a depth and brightness that can be very addictive. When I lived in Texas, we ate them often—either topped with cheese and rice, as a base to bean salad, alongside enchiladas or even in my mom’s King Ranch casserole . But beyond the deliciousness and versatility of Ranch Style Beans, there’s the appeal of that iconic black can with its distinctive Western-style font and illustration of a man with his tongue sticking out stating the beans are Appetite Pleasin’. (Of course, the latter is a recent development for if you’re as old as I am, you remember when the beans were Husband Pleasin’.) I love that can and I’ve read that if Andy Warhol had been a Texan he would have painted Ranch Style Beans cans instead of Campbell’s Soup cans. I believe it. In the 15 years since I’ve moved to New York City, I’ve seen this city become more hospitable to fellow homesick Texans. We now have a Texan-style barbecue joint selling Kreuz sausages and excellent brisket; you can find Ro-Tel tomatoes at several grocery stores; dried and canned chiles are a common staple; and Austin-based Whole Foods is now here selling decent brands of tortillas, chips and salsas. But despite the advances this city’s made, there’s still one thing missing: my beloved Ranch Style Beans. To help with the drought, every time I go home I load up on a few cans. And my mom has even been known to put them in my Christmas stocking, which is always a very welcome gift. But when I recently came to my last can with no trip home in my immediate future, I realized that I should just figure out how to make these beans on my own. The recipe is a closely guarded secret, so I was flummoxed on what to do. And then I read one fan’s observation that Ranch Style Beans are simply pintos swimming in a chili gravy. At last, it all made sense! I decided I’d cook a pot of pintos in a chili gravy and see what happened. When making my chile gravy, I used the ingredient list on the back of my remaining can as my guide. Sure, there were some vague terms, such as “spices” and “natural flavor,” but the basic building blocks were in the open: tomatoes, chile peppers, paprika, vinager and beef fat. And of course, pinto beans. Even though the can didn’t specify what type of chile, I went with anchos as they’re the base of your common chili powder. I rehydrated the anchos and then blended them with some tomatoes, vinegar, cumin and paprika. And instead of beef fat, I opted to use beef broth instead. While the beans cooked, the house smelled gorgeous and the broth tasted right. But it wasn’t until after a few hours when I ladled out a bowl that I realized that this bowl of beans far exceeded my expectations. I threw in some sour cream, warmed up a flour tortilla and had a most satisfying meal. And even though it’s been 15 years since I gave away those beans, I’ve often wondered if the New Yorker who ended up with them enjoyed them. I hope that they did. Ranch style beans Ingredients: 16 oz. of dried pinto beans 6 ancho chiles, stems and seeds removed 6 cloves of garlic, minced 1 onion, diced 1 15 oz. can of tomatoes (or 2 medium-sized tomatoes, peeled) 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon oregano 1 cup of water 6 cups of beef broth Salt and black pepper to taste Method: Soak the beans covered in water—either overnight or the quick soak method in which you place the beans in a pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, cover and remove from heat and let sit for one hour. Drain the soaked beans. In a cast-iron skillet heated up to medium high, cook the anchos on each side for a couple of minutes (or until they start to bubble and pop), turn off the heat and fill the skillet with warm water. Let them sit until soft and rehydrated, which should happen after half an hour or so. In the pot you’ll be cooking your beans, heat up a teaspoon of canola oil and cook the onions for ten minutes on medium. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Throw the cooked onions and garlic in a blender and add the tomatoes, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, paprika, cumin, oregano, water and hydrated ancho chiles. Puree until smooth. Add the pinto beans and beef broth to the pot and stir in the chile puree. On high, bring the pot to a boil and then cover; turn the heat down to low and simmer for two and a half hours, stirring occasionally. At this point, I check my beans for tenderness as depending on the freshness of the beans I find that the cooking time can be as short as two and a half hours and as long as four hours. When you're satisfied that the beans are done, salt and pepper to taste. Feeds four to six. Notes: If you can’t find dried ancho chiles, you can substitute either ancho chile powder or regular chili powder. I’d use 1/4 of a cup. These are not fiery beans, but if you want a bit more heat I'd throw in a bit of Cayenne. And I always add a pinch of baking soda to my soaking beans to help with digestion issues. You may do the same. ----------------- Are you on Facebook? A reader recommended I set up a Homesick Texan fan page, so I did. Please stop by and feel free to share links, upload photos or just say howdy! Homesick Texan fan page If you were in Houston in the 1980’s, it was hard to escape the ubiquitous tacos al carbon. Ninfa Laurenzo—of the eponymous Ninfa’s—made them her signature dish and as with her green sauce , many Houston Mexican restaurants soon added these tacos to their menus as well. Tacos al carbon became a defining characteristic of Houston Tex-Mex But what exactly are tacos al carbon? The term al carbon is the Spanish phrase for cooking over coal, so you should expect grilled meats inside a tortilla. If you have tacos al carbon in Mexico, you will indeed find a variety of meats wrapped in either corn or flour tortillas depending on where you are geographically. But in Texas tacos al carbon came to mean one thing: cuts of grilled beef, nestled in a fluffy flour tortilla . But wait, isn’t that a fajita? Now this is where it gets confusing. So what's the difference between fajitas and tacos al carbon? As I understand it, very little. Fajitas, which translates to little belts, are traditionally made with the tough diaphragm cut of beef known as skirt steak, which is a long and narrow, much like a belt. The meat is often marinated and then grilled or griddled, and it’s served with a prescribed array of condiments such as guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and a stack of flour tortillas, all used to roll your own tacos. And yes, you can make fajitas, the dish, out of shrimp or chicken, but since the word itself refers to the cut of beef, technically it should be called something else. Tacos al carbon, however, can be made with any type of meat, not just the traditional skirt steak. And unlike fajitas, the tacos are already made instead of being a do-it-yourself affair. I think this is the main difference, but even for me it’s a bit of a semantic stretch. Small differences aside, I still prefer tacos al carbon to fajitas. Sure, fajitas are a quite the spectacle, but sometimes you crave a more refined presentation. (Or perhaps I prefer tacos al carbon because I burned myself on the sizzling fajita skillet one too many times!) But no matter how you serve it, it’s hard to resist a fresh flour tortilla wrapped around succulent beef so flavorful you can eat the two together unadorned. I live in a small apartment without any outdoor space so there’s no cooking over coal for me. But if I get my cast-iron skillet hot enough and then slide my steak under the broiler, I get a nice charred crust that’s almost as good as what I could get on a grill. So yes, technically these aren’t true tacos al carbon (they're more like tacos a la plancha, which means tacos of the griddle). But I don’t mind because after one bite I’m back in that little restaurant on Navigation where the beef is juicy, the tortillas are soft and the green sauce is plentiful. Tacos al carbon, small-apartment style Ingredients: 2 pounds skirt steak Juice of 4 limes (about 1/2 cup) 4 cloves of garlic 1/4 cup cilantro 1 jalapeno 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 teaspoon of canola oil or nonstick cooking spray Four green onions (optional) Method: To make the marinade, in a blender mix all the ingredients except for the skirt steak, canola oil and green onions. Pour over skirt steak and let it marinate for 2 to 8 hours in the refrigerator. Before cooking, rinse off the marinade and let the steak come to room temperature. Heat on high for 10 minutes a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan (you may have to cut the steak in half to fit). Also, turn on the broiler in your oven. When the skillet is hot (to test I throw in a drop of water and it should immediately evaporate), grease your pan with either the oil or nonstick cooking spray and add your steak. Cook on one side for two minutes then turn and cook on the other side for two minutes. After it’s cooked on both sides, place the green onions in the skillet with the steak still in it and place the skillet under the broiler for two minutes. Remove steak from pan and let it rest for 10 minutes. If onions aren’t charred enough, slide the skillet back under the broiler. After meat has rested, slice the meat against the grain and roll in fluffy, flour tortillas with green onions on the side. Serves 4-6. Notes: I don’t have a grill or outdoor space, so I don’t know as much as I’d like to about the subject, but to cook the steaks truly al carbon, I’ve been told five minutes per side should do the trick. --------- Homesick Texan has been nominated for best regional food blog in Savuer’s First Annual Best Food Blog Awards. I’m pleased as punch about this nod as it just confirms what we’ve all known for a long time: Texas food is wonderful! Please be sure and check out all the excellent blogs nominated--it's quite a round up! And if you’re so inclined I’d love your vote, which you can place right here . Thank you! I’m roasting chiles and frying up bacon. What am I making, you might ask? What everybody wants to eat after being ill for a few days: chipotle macaroni and cheese. With bacon, of course. OK, so this might seem a bit heavy for a re-entry into the land of the normal eating, but let me tell you—I’m hungry! And while the best thing I can say about not feeling well is that your skinny jeans are suddenly a viable option in your wardrobe, in the end I’d rather be well than ill. Though who wouldn’t? But let’s talk about chipotle macaroni and cheese, shall we? My family, much like yours I reckon, has always made homemade macaroni and cheese. Sure, we’d have the box stuff on hand for after-school snacks or donations to the church food pantry, but in my house the real, homemade stuff was what was preferred. Mom makes her macaroni and cheese in a variety of ways, but my favorite is a casserole of pasta suspended in a luscious sauce comprised of egg yolks, cheese and heavy cream. And just when you think it couldn’t be any more extravagant, she throws in diced, thick ham and tops it off with buttery breadcrumbs. Yes, this is an excellent dish, but because of its richness I only advise serving it on special occasions. When it comes to a more everyday, simple macaroni and cheese, I turn to a method I learned in the New York Times. This recipe requires little effort besides pouring cottage cheese blended with milk over dry pasta, tossing in some shredded cheese and baking it for an hour. No endless stirring a sauce or boiling a batch of pasta, which makes it a cinch to make. The Times version kept it plain, but I’ve made it my own by adding chipotle and garlic. And I top it with bacon and cotija, which adds contrast to the oozing cheese and soft pasta. I realize that my macaroni and cheese may appear decadent as decadent as my monm's, but feel free to convince yourself that it’s a touch more healthy due to the cottage cheese and all. I do. But you know what? We’re nearing the end of a long, cold winter and sometimes you just need to pamper yourself. And for me, comfort comes clothed in chipotle chiles, cheese and bacon. Chipotle macaroni and cheese with bacon (adapted from the NY Times) Ingredients: 2 cups of dry elbow pasta 2 cups of milk 1 cup of cottage cheese 1 chipotle chile in adobo 1 teaspoon mustard powder 1 clove of garlic, roughly chopped Pinch of cumin Salt and black pepper to taste 3 cups of shredded cheese, a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack 1/4 cup of crumbled cotija cheese (optional, but delicious!) 4 pieces of cooked bacon, chopped 1 tablespoon of butter Method: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 9-inch cast-iron skillet or a 9-inch square or round baking pan with the butter. Add the dry pasta. In a blender, mix together the milk, cottage cheese, chipotle chile, mustard powder, garlic, cumin, salt and black pepper until it’s smooth. Pour mixture over dry pasta and stir until sauce is evenly distributed. Stir in two cups of the shredded cheese, cover the pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and stir the macaroni and cheese a couple of times. Top with the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese and chopped bacon and cook for another 25 minutes uncovered or until brown and bubbling. Remove from oven, sprinkle with cotija and serve. Note: If you’re not familiar with cotija cheese, it’s a Mexican hard cheese that’s like a cross between feta and parmesan. It’s become increasingly more common, so you can find it at many regular grocery stores and Hispanic markets. And if you live in New York City, I found at Mexicana Bakery in Jackson Heights at 86-06 Roosevelt a wonderful cotija coated in dried chiles. Also, chipotle bacon jam might go dandy with this as well! The day before Ash Wednesday? Yep, I’m a pancake eater. I grew up in an Episcopalian family and that’s how we rolled—in warm griddlecakes and cold glasses of milk. And even though most of my friends prepare for Lent in a more colorful style, old traditions are hard to shake and I still enjoy a tall stack of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. Pancakes might not be shiny beads, feathered costumes, fevered dancing or boisterous singing, but they don’t have to be completely boring. I’ve been known to serve gingerbread pancakes , buttermilk pancakes, banana nut pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes. But to truly get in the frenzied spirit on the eve of Lent, Uncle Austin’s coconut pancakes (more colorfully known as Uncle Austin's Mexican pancakes) are a definite must. When I was young, Austin would make these pancakes for us on special occasions. Their main attraction was their size—he’d make one pancake the entire width of a 10-inch pan. And you didn’t even have to share this big baby—no way—this over-sized coconut pancake was all for you! But incredible heft aside, Austin’s Mexican pancakes were sweet with fresh coconut, and some family members allege that there was chocolate and nuts in them as well. I asked Austin for his recipe, but he said that not only had he not made these in 30 years, but also that he never really had one. Instead, he just took my grandpa’s basic pancake recipe and dolled it up a bit with the shredded coconut, chunks of brown sugar and extra pats of butter. Curious why they were known as Mexican pancakes, he admitted that there was nothing authentically Mexican about them, but it was very, very important to be listening to Tejano music, preferably loud, while making them. He stressed, however that the main excitement was in the flipping of the 10-inch pancake—the messier the better! If you’re celebrating pancake Tuesday, why not try Uncle Austin’s Mexican coconut pancakes—they’re far more adventurous than your usual buttermilk pancakes. And
with the Tejano thumping and the pancake batter flying, it may be the most thrilling pancake supper you’ve ever had! What's your favorite pancake recipe? Coconut pancakes (Uncle Austin’s Mexican pancakes) Ingredients: 1 egg 1 1/2 cups of milk 2 cups of flour 1 tablespoon of whole-wheat flour 1 tablespoon of fresh baking powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup fresh shredded coconut Juice from one lime (about 2 tablespoons) plus 1/2 teaspoon of lime zest 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon 4 tablespoons of melted butter Method: Beat together the egg and the milk. Stir in the rest of the ingredients and mix until smooth. If too thick, add more milk For regular-sized pancakes, pour 1/4 cup of batter onto greased skillet heated at medium low. For Austin-sized pancakes, pour about 1 1/2 cups to 2 cups of batter into pan. Cook for a few minutes on one side, until edges are brown and bubbles form in batter. Flip and cook on other side a couple more minutes. Makes about 12 small pancakes or 3 extra-large pancakes. Note: Chopped pecans and chocolate chips are an excellent addition if you like. Austin recommends serving them with pineapple and I agree. I also top my pancakes with yogurt, but honey or syrup would be dandy as well. And Austin didn’t add limejuice or cinnamon in his original recipe—that was my doing. When I was invited to a party where Southern pork dishes were being celebrated, the decision on what to bring was a no-brainer: Mexican chocolate pralines. Now before you call my contribution a little odd, let me explain myself. My first (and more obvious) choice was to make cookies with lard. I didn’t have any lard on hand, however, so I went to the Union Square farmers’ market to pick up a tub. But a snowstorm had threatened to blanket the city and my preferred lard vendor wasn’t there; clearly, I had to come up with another plan. I’ve been spending lots of time lately reading old cookbooks. I’m curious to see what our ancestors ate and to see when certain dishes may have come into the common culinary vernacular. When looking for inspiration, I recalled that I had recently come across an old Mexican-candy recipe that called for piloncillo (or brown sugar) to be cooked with water and a strip of raw bacon. Now, I know bacon in a dessert is a trendy thing these days, but I was intrigued to see it listed in a 100-year-old recipe. And while I didn’t have lard to make cookies, bacon was easily attainable. In another cookbook, I had seen a recipe for Mexican-chocolate pralines. So for the pork-themed feast, I decided to combine the two thoughts and make Mexican-chocolate pralines with bacon. Making a first-time dish to share at a large gathering is always brave if not foolish. And while the flavor of these pralines was pleasing, the texture was too delicate. So instead of patties thick with pecans and bacon, I had broken chips and shards instead. My pralines looked sad. Plus you couldn’t even really taste the bacon! But I was out of time and couldn’t show up empty handed so I threw the pieces into a tin and headed to the party. I suppose my offering these praline pieces was the equivalent of a student who shows a failed project to a teacher to prove that she has at least tried to complete the assignment. I gave myself about a C for effort. But then a strange thing happened. While at the party, I witnessed people eating the Mexican-chocolate praline pieces. And they were smiling! With pleasure! So, with a little work I knew I could make the Mexican chocolate pralines into something special. Buoyed by my friends’ comments, the next day I attempted to make these pralines again. I threw out the bacon (even though it had been the primary impetus to make these in the first place), added more nuts, let the candy cook longer and threw in some orange zest for a hint of brightness. And after an hour of letting the pralines harden, I had a long sheet of parchment paper lined with a fine batch of Mexican chocolate pralines. If you’re looking for Valentine’s inspiration, these take little time and effort to make but are very impressive (even when they’re not entirely perfect). But you don’t need a special occasion to eat them, as they’re a simple pleasure that can be enjoyed at any time. Mexican chocolate pralines (adapted from Aprovecho ) Ingredients: 1 disc of Mexican hot chocolate, such as Ibarra 2 oz. of unsweetened baking chocolate 2 cups of pecans, 1 cup chopped and 1 cup whole 1 1/2 cups of sugar 3/4 cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of milk 6 tablespoons of butter 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 2 teaspoons fresh orange zest or 1 teaspoon dried orange zest 1/4 teaspoon Cayenne pepper 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Tools needed: Candy thermometer Parchment paper Method: In an oven set at 350 degrees, roast the pecans for 10 minutes. In a large pot, melt together on medium heat the chocolates, sugars, pecans, milk, butter, cinnamon, orange zest, Cayenne and sea salt, stirring occasionally. Place a candy thermometer in the pot to monitor the heat. When it reaches 235 degrees, remove from fire and add the vanilla and stir the pot for two minutes. There should be a bit of shine to the candy but the candy will be a bit more thick. Scoop pralines onto parchment paper. (If it’s too stiff, add warm water to mixture.) Let cool for an hour and remove. They will still be a bit shiny but will lose that shine after a few hours. No matter, they're still delicious! Depending on how large your scoops may be, this makes about 20 pralines. They will keep for five days. Note: If you want to add bacon to these, I’d fry up four slices, crumble them and stir into praline when you add the vanilla. Growing up in Houston, I’m no stranger to chicken and sausage gumbo. The city’s close proximity to Louisiana’s Cajun country insured that I knew plenty of kids with family names such as Boudreaux, Guidry or Hebert, whose parents often had a big pot of the chunky soup simmering on the stove. After an afternoon of riding bikes, you could walk into one of these kitchens, grab a bowl and ladle a portion thick with smoky, succulent meats over a pile of rice. Gumbo is good and during the cold months it was almost as prevalent as chili in my part of town. With the New Orleans Saints going to the Super Bowl for the first time, the decision about what to make on the big day is simple. Sure, quarterback Drew Brees may be a Texan but my Super Bowl plan is to cook a big pot of chicken and sausage gumbo. And while I’ve long been a gumbo eater for some reason, however, I’ve never been much of a gumbo maker. So when I needed advice, I turned to Ken Wheaton. Ken Wheaton, who lives in Brooklyn but hails from Opelousas, Louisiana, is famous in certain New York City circles for his gumbo. So much that when his editor caught wind of his prowess, he insisted that Ken include his recipe in his excellent new novel, The First Annual Grand Prairie Rabbit Festival . Ken’s novel isn’t a food novel, per se. Nope, it’s a story about a confused Catholic priest struggling with his faith and vows. And while that may seem like a heavy topic, in Ken’s hands it’s a humorous, heartfelt story that will make you laugh and might even make you cry. But it will also make you hungry for both Cajun food and culture as Ken deftly captures small-town Louisiana life in all its church-going, Zydeco-dancing and gumbo-making glory. And yes, please note that there’s also lots of swearing, drinking and rabbit-stew eating—it’s not a book for the easily offended. I won’t get into plot particulars, nor will I delve into any other English-major mumbo jumbo that I probably knew at one point but have long since forgotten. But do know this: Ken is an expert storyteller who has an amazing gift of creating a sense of place. And if you’ve been aching to spend some time in Cajun country with some colorful characters, his book will tide you over until you can enjoy the real thing. Of course, you can also satisfy your hunger by making a batch of gumbo. Because I like to tinker, I messed with Ken’s method just a bit, but I followed his key rules to not add tomatoes, mushrooms or carrots. And while the word gumbo stems from the Bantu term for okra, kingombo , I didn’t add that as well even though it’s quite common to include it for both flavor and its thickening power. If you’ve ever been intimidated by making gumbo, as I was, don’t be. The hardest part is making the roux (which I now do in the oven so it’s a snap) and waiting for the soup to be ready. And when you tuck into your bowl filled with a rich broth, smoky sausage and tender chicken, you’ll be happy that you made a batch. Your friends and family will thank you, too. But enough about me, what are y'all making for the Super Bowl? Chicken and sausage gumbo (adapted from Ken Wheaton) Ingredients: 1 four-pound chicken, cut into parts 2 pounds of andouille sausage, sliced 2 onions, 1 diced and 1 cut into quarters 10 cloves of garlic, 5 minced and 5 whole 4 ribs of celery, 3 diced and 1 cut into quarters 2 bell peppers, diced 4 bay leaves 2 sprigs of fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dry 1 bunch of green onions, green part diced 1 cup of canola oil plus a tablespoon 1 cup of flour 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce 1 teaspoon of filé powder plus more for serving Salt, Cayenne and black pepper to taste Method: To make your roux, in a large cast iron skillet, mix together the flour and the canola oil. Place in an oven set at 350 degrees, walk away and let it cook for two hours. No hovering, no stirring, no nothing! After a couple of hours, take it out of the oven and it should be chocolate brown. Now, you can also do it the standing over the stove method if you prefer, but I don’t. While the roux is cooking, make your chicken and broth. First, season your chicken parts generously with salt, black pepper and Cayenne. Place the chicken parts in a large pot with the quartered onions, whole garlic, quartered celery, 2 bay leaves and 8 quarts of water. Bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour and a half, skimming any foam that rises to the surface. Take the chicken out of the pot and when it’s cool, remove the fat and pick the meat off the bones and cut into pieces. (Be sure and save the bones for another round of stock making.) When the broth is cool, strain and throw out the vegetables. Remove the fat with a gravy separator or by the plastic bag method. To do the latter, you’ll pour the broth into a quart-sized plastic storage bag and once you see the fat rise to the top, snip off a bottom corner and drain it until you reach the fat layer. Do this in batches. You should have about 8 quarts. Clean your pot (or get another big one if you’re blessed with a large, well-stocked kitchen) and in the bottom of it heat up 1 tablespoon of canola oil. Add the diced onions and let them cook for 10 minutes. Add the chopped celery and bell pepper, cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Throw in the minced garlic and cook for a minute. Now stir in the roux and cook it with the vegetables for five minutes, stirring every so often. Add the chicken meat and half of the sliced sausage and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If things start to get sticky, pour in some water or wine. Now, slowly whisk in your strained chicken broth to the roux, vegetable, meat mixture. Throw in two more bay leaves, thyne and the Worcestershire, bring to a boil and then simmer for an hour. At this time add the remaining sausage and cook for another hour. Fifteen minutes before it’s done, add the minced green onions and filé powder and check to see if it needs salt, black and Cayenne pepper. Remove bay leaves and serve over cooked rice with file powder for people to add to their bowls. Notes: This is a soupy gumbo. If you like it thicker, use less liquid and/or cook it for a lot longer than stated here. Filé (pronounced fee-lay) powder is ground sassafras leaves and a dash of it will also help thicken it. If you’re feeling wild, replace the canola oil with bacon grease. Ken also adds tasso (a Cajun ham) to his chicken and sausage gumbo, but I couldn’t find that here in NYC. If you’re in that predicament, however, Ken suggests ordering your sausage and tasso from his hometown butcher, Kelly's Country Meat Block & Diner (Toll free 1-866-948-MEAT). He says, "I usually order pure pork sausage, but lots of people are fans of the half&amp;half (beef and pork). The andouille is killer. The tasso is awesome. They also have rabbits, too!" Or he likes to use Bruce Aidell’s andoille sausage, as he believes it has an authentic flavor. He also prefers cooking up only chicken thighs and skipping the whole broth-making step and just adds water to the pot as he lets his pot of gumbo simmer forever. Do this if you prefer. Full disclosure: Ken’s my friend and I’ve been watching him write this novel for many years, so you can take what I say about it with a grain of salt. That said please know I would never recommend something unless I loved it and thought y’all might love it, too. A friend and I were comparing notes about our favorite childhood treats. As I was raving about my grandma’s chocolate pie , my friend said, “So how’s your grandma’s chocolate gravy?” Huh? Chocolate gravy—is that like mole, I asked. Nope, it’s spooned on biscuits, she said. I had to admit that I’d never heard of chocolate gravy; clearly I’d been deprived. Curious why I had been denied the joys of chocolate gravy all my life, I called my grandma and demanded an explanation. “Why don’t you make chocolate gravy?” I asked. She replied, “Because I don’t know what it is.” I see. Apparently, my grandma was in the dark on this secret as well. My only consolation? At least I wasn’t alone. So what’s the provenance of chocolate gravy? Because I know everything, I assumed that if I hadn’t heard of it, then it must not be Texan. I was wrong. I poked around and not only had my friend—a long-standing Texan—grown up eating it within slapping distance of Dallas, but other Texan friends had been eating it all their lives as well. I heard chocolate-gravy stories from friends as far west as Midland and as far south as Houston. Though friends who had grown up in Arkansas, Tennessee and Georgia had also indulged, so it’s not particular to just Texas. But no matter, my family had been missing out on a very good thing. I needed to make up for lost time. A little research revealed that there hadn’t been much chocolate-gravy recipe evolution over the years. The biggest schism I found in the chocolate-gravy community was whether to use milk or water as your liquid. I was surprised that no one had thrown some chipotle or bacon into their gravy, but actually this pleased me as it proved that chocolate gravy was indeed a classic that didn’t need any tinkering. But enough about thinking, it was time to eat. I made my first batch and it was a deep, dark concoction—smooth, creamy and thick. I sliced a biscuit in half and plopped some chocolate gravy on each half. My first bite revealed this gravy’s pleasures. Its pudding-like consistency is pure comfort on a cold, winter morning. And while biscuits are in no way virtuous, their texture and heft prevents the gravy from sliding into total decadence, which is important as this is a breakfast treat after all, not dessert. Does chocolate gravy and biscuits replace my beloved chocolate pie? No, but I certainly wouldn’t pass up an opportunity to pass an occasional morning with it poured on top of a biscuit. And am I the only one who didn’t grow up eating this? No matter, I am very, very pleased to finally make its acquaintance. Chocolate gravy Ingredients: 3/4 cup of sugar 1/4 cup of flour 1/4 cup of cocoa powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 2 cups of milk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon of butter Method: Mix together in a pot the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt and cinnamon (can sift if it’s too lumpy). Add the milk and while stirring cook on medium heat until it thickens. Stir in the vanilla and butter and serve immediately with biscuits . Notes: As you can see in the photos I topped mine with some chopped pecans. If you’re not a purist, I highly recommend this; hazelnuts would be delicious as well. And if you’re feeling extra spicy, go ahead and throw in a pinch of Cayenne or chipotle powder! And this is how fellow-Texan Shaw
After a year and a half off from racing, it was time to think about doing another tri. But since I’m still dealing with some atrophy in my left leg, the idea of doing much running didn’t appeal – even though I’m a runner. I was just enjoying getting back into a more regular routine of training. I swear I missed my friends and the lifestyle more than the races – even though the races act as a big giant carrot to motivate me to train. In January, I had an epiphany on the way home from my Master’s Swim workout. ‘Hey, if I can swim 3,000 yards now, maybe I can swim 2.4 miles by the summer.’ I kept that thought to myself for a couple of weeks. Then I confessed my crazy thought-slash-pipe dream to Sharkbait. And later that week, I asked my trail patrol partner, The Governor, if he thought I could ride my bike 112 miles by the summer. (He knows I’m out of shape and I’ve never done a century in my life.) And since, I can be really insecure sometimes I got three more second opinions. I asked my swim coach, Mary, 734’s Dad, and my rehab therapist, Quinn, if they thought I could go those distances. No one hesitated – except me. ‘Should I do it? Should I do it?’ After thinking about it another day, I finally hit the ‘Submit’ button. Game on. I’m doing the Full Vineman Aquabike on July 31st. It’ll be just like doing an Ironman without the 26-mile run-walk-‘til-I-drop. It will give me a chance to really work on my triathlon weaknesses. And it will give me time to gain back all that quad muscle strength before I do some serious running and racing again. I’m going long with the goal of getting strong. Last year, I saw an older woman with a walker enter the rehab pool. She had a t-shirt with big letters bedazzled in silver dots that said, “FIERCE.” That pretty much described the weather out here in the past couple of weeks. The music in our pilates class was interrupted by a tornado warning issued by the National Weather Service. We were dumbfounded. That doesn’t happen in Southern California. If anything, we get waterspouts offshore. We used levity to hide our concern and joked about taking shelter under the reformer. When I got out to my car, there were two messages from 734’s Dad. And by the time I got home, the phone rang again and this time it was my dad in Boston, sounding a tad agitated because he saw my neighborhood on the news. Turns out the tornado touched down two miles from my place. I had no idea. I downplayed the whole thing and said the news trucks always hang out for the waves and the puddles in January. Ha, I had NO idea a truck and two boats had been flipped nearby. Roofs had been torn off and windows broken. I live near the beach with an ocean view. Watching the waves come in was like watching fireworks. I couldn’t stop gawking at them. And in the middle of the night, if the wind howled a little too much, I ran into the living room – away from the windows. We had tons of people who came by our pier to assess the damage to the beach and take pictures of the ocean. Pictures that only told half the story. Because the sound that they made, the smell, and the way they shook the shore and the pier was nothing short of FIERCE. After only a half dozen Master’s swimming workouts, I’m starting to notice a few distinct changes. 1. I can swim a lot farther than I thought. Last night my training log calculated 7.59 miles so far this year. (In a perfect world, it would’ve been 7.34, but Coach Mary pushed me to go longer.) 2. I’m learning how to do swim strokes that I’ve never really attempted before because no one ever made me or showed me how to do them. My backstroke isn’t pretty, but I haven’t caused any damage to my training partners yet. 3. I’m cramping so badly during workouts that my body feels possessed after 1,500-2,000 yards. I figure my toes and calves are going through an adaptation phase. Or maybe it should be classified as hazing since this Master’s group feels a bit like a sorority when we’re laughing about our workouts in the locker room. 4. My laundry hamper is piling up a lot faster with big towels. 5. I’m frequently reaching for those Swimmer’s eardrops. 6. I’m positively giddy with endorphins after each workout. 7. My happiness quotient has gone way up. Sharkbait noticed a difference too. Near the end of Wednesday’s workout, she called out to me from a couple of lanes away with a smile and a nod of approval, “You’re gliding!” “What?” I replied. “You’re gliding!!” “Oh,” I answered. A compliment on my swimming definitely takes a little while to register. I wondered, ‘Have I ever glided before? And if so, when?’ There I go overanalyzing things again. Who cares? For one length of the pool, it happened. I had a witness. I’m ending this post with a shout out to some of my favorite bloggers. This week’s Six’s Picks include the new Mr . and Mrs. James Walsh , Running is Funny , TriTawn , Steve in a Speedo?! Gross! (and his lovely wife Pharmie ). Last year, I reluctantly kept track of my workout log. I found myself filling in some of the blanks at the end of ’09 like it was the week before taxes. I pieced things together by asking for copies of my workout log at the gym and scanning my Garmin data. Sadly, most of my swim workouts never got recorded. I know I did a bunch of them with a pull buoy at the local school’s pool. Enter the New Year’s Resolution: be more consistent. That applies to everything from filling out my log on Fitness Journal.com to cleaning out the fridge. And with this resolution comes another (which I’ve been working on for a few months), don’t fret, worry or feel guilty about all the stuff that didn’t get done. I’m trying to focus more on the doing and less on the angst of what I’m not getting done. I know I may slip from time to time on this one, but I’ll keep plugging away at it. I’m happy to report that 2010 is off to a great start. In the first 10 days of the year, I’ve worked out on 7 days doing 7 different activities. And this afternoon, I think I rinsed out 7 old condiment jars and put them in the recycling bin. Seven (aka 734, the cat) will be so proud. Actually, he won’t care as long as I hide 7 treats around the house to keep him occupied. I’m savoring the holidays as much as possible. I know, I know, time to move on to the resolutions. I’m stalling big time. I don’t even want to take my tree down, but I will this afternoon. Suffice it to say, the holidays were just what I needed this year. Perhaps they should add another Christmas in July just to stimulate the economy and raise morale. I don’t think it’s just me. Everyone seems to be in a better mood. I had a great time kicking back with my loved ones, finding gifts, wrapping them and all of that good stuff. And while I had to use more restraint than I would have liked this year, it was the thought that counted – both on the giving and receiving end. One of my favorite gifts came with this custom tag created by 734’s Dad’s brother Ken . How cool. It was attached to some tempo music, The Gorillaz Demon Days CD. My family, 734’s Dad , and my training partners came through with some awesome gifts to get me in the mood to train. More importantly, they made me feel like an athlete again. Sharkbait gave me some cycling socks with autumn leaves to remind me of home and an assortment of gels and electrolyte drink mixes. TriDiver gave me some Pearl Izumi running gloves and a Triathlete license plate holder. My marathoner sister, Jane, gave me a nice running jacket. Ryan surprised me with a text, “Hey, don’t do anything stupid like renewing your subscription to Triathlete Magazine. Merry Christmas!” And 734’s Dad gave me everything on my wish list. Wow, how did he ever know? (That’s right, I hinted big time.) When I opened the Finis Hydro Hip training tool, he said, “Hey, I thought only maxi pads had wings!” I know he secretly gets a kick out of seeing all the idiosyncrasies that go along triathlon training. 734’s Dad’s parents gave me a very generous check to pass onto the Challenged Athletes Foundation . They knew I would have liked to do Operation Rebound again last year at Oceanside. I was quite touched by that gesture. And one of my all-time favorite gifts came from Nikki, Sharkbait’s daughter. Since the kid recently went through quite a growth spurt, I received her old TYR split fins. I heard good things about these fins. I’m hoping they really improve my swim. I’m also hoping that osmosis takes affect because this girl can swim 100 yards in 1:15. Yeah, I wanna swim like her! Hmm, okay I just don’t want to be lapped by her. ‘Cause that wouldn’t be very nice to do to “Mealie Minnow” would it? Uh-oh, I think I just signed up for my first swim race. Rumor has it, the kid reads my blog. When I arrived at the pool last night, it was about 45 degrees. If this steam and fog came off a big black caldron, you’d swear it was some sort of witch’s brew. A cold and holiday festivities kept me out of the pool for a couple of weeks. I was excited to get back in there. Coach Mary gave me some instructions for a set, “Okay, I want you to leave on the :40.” I suspect I wasn’t quite that punctual, but I really have no idea. I was having a Lucy/Miss Magoo moment out there. I couldn’t see the clock through the fog at the other end of the pool. I couldn’t see how much time elapsed on my lap counter. And I was fumbling with my Polar to get it to stopwatch mode because I couldn’t see the numbers on that either. Rather than draw attention to my inability to see, I just swam as fast as I could and tried not to dawdle too much in between. I swam until I had goose bumps on my goose bumps and my left calf and right toes cramped. Mary still made me do a cool down with a pull buoy. I knew she was right, but it sure didn’t feel like I needed a cool down with the onset of hypothermia. I managed to go 2,050 yards. After a nice hot shower, Sharkbait invited me over to her house for some ham-and-split pea soup. Is there anything better on a cold night? It reminded me of snow days in Massachusetts, when school was cancelled and I could sled for hours in the backyard. When I arrived at her house, Sharkbait lamented, “I couldn’t see anything in that fog! I couldn’t make out the clock or see the numbers on my watch.” I felt so relieved that it wasn't just me. Now, if Barracuda could just come out with foggy night-vision goggles next. Aside from all the fun holiday celebrations, my absolute favorite thing this past week was getting back to the dirt. Some women like perfume. I like the smell of dirt. The sting of the crisp, cool air. And the sound of the reeds rustling in the wind. I got it all when I went for a trail run on the afternoon before Christmas Eve. It turned out to be 4.33 miles and it felt just right. I had to walk it in a couple of the steep spots, but overall I was able to run. And I’m very happy to report that it didn’t feel like I needed to borrow a lung. I was truly surprised that it felt that good. I did not expect that YET. So the day after Christmas, I did it all over again. Both days, I went out in my new XTERRA XR 1.0 shoes . They felt super-comfortable out there. No complaints whatsoever. On Sunday, I had my monthly trail patrol for the California State Parks. My third time back. Keith, the Governor, lead the way. I started out great and made it up a mile climb without too much trouble, although I’m sure I was quite slow. When we hit “No Dogs” I couldn’t make it up the second hill, and I didn’t clip out fast enough. I didn’t want to land on my knee and instead I kind of hyper-extended my left leg and fell backwards. Next thing I knew I was on the ground on my back with my Santa Cruz Blur stuck between my legs at an awkward angle. A little embarrassing trying to extricate myself and get back up, except no one witnessed it. Ha! Keith and Dan were already waiting at the top. Falling is just part of mountain biking. But I could feel the disparity in my quad muscle strength as I attempted the climb. It’s a little bit of a bummer, but I know it will get better. It messed with my head for the rest of the ride though. We went on a new singletrack trail that was built with Keith’s help while I was away – Ticketron. Normally, it would’ve been no problem. Okay, maybe I would have popped off the bike in a couple of places. Instead, I walked a lot of it with my bike. The steep climb out of Deer Canyon usually called for some hike-a-biking, but I was doin’ way more hikin’ than bikin’. When we arrived at the first stretch of single track on Fenceline, it was no problem, but the second stretch, I had to clip out so quickly and so often that I gave up and walked the rest of the way. My knee ached a little – enough to give up on the idea of doing a brick workout with a little run afterwards. I got through it. I went to places I haven’t been to in a long time on my mountain bike. And I had a lot of fun hanging out with the guys. Dan thought for sure that he would slow us down. Nope, it was me. When we stopped for some nutrition, I mentioned that I really liked the Hammer Gel Apple Cinnamon flavor. I said, “Wow, this tastes just like apple pie.” Dan replied right back, “Oh, I’d need ice cream with that…” Which pretty much gives you the flavor of the conversation that went back and forth between three immature trail patrol volunteers. When we arrived back in the parking lot, we had a visit from 734’s Dad who rode across a couple of mountain ranges to meet up with us and say “Hi!” What a guy! Next week, I get to do it all over again. Hmmm, maybe I’ll take a different route. Would you believe Slow ‘n Easy? Yup, that’s a trail. A winding mile-and-a-quarter fire road. I wasn’t really sure what I’d write about here after my knee surgery last winter. I knew I wouldn’t have a triathlon season. I wanted to talk to others who came back strong after being sidelined. It was an idea that was kickin’ around in my head for a few weeks when the unthinkable happened. A dear friend of mine was in a serious ski accident and suffered a spinal cord injury, and a few days later a stroke. I felt helpless to do anything for him as he lay in the hospital. I decided to start a new series: Comeback Kids. I’d do a new story every Friday for him, his family, and his closest buddies – for as long as he was in the hospital. That was the plan. I had no idea how I’d pull it off. I put it out there and hoped for the best. And I truly met the best in the process. Friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers who were more than willing to do the phone interviews, email me pictures, and review their story drafts prior to posting on the big Friday deadline. They divulged some pretty personal stuff, some pearls of wisdom, and always some kind words for my buddy. I’d like to thank each every one of them once again. Hall of Fame Triathlete Karen Smyers who called me from a yellow cab in New York City on a business trip. Pro triathlete Joanna Zeiger who said, “Don’t quit with your rehab until you are satisfied with the results.” Yes, she spent five hours a day doing rehab for her back injury. (She inspires me to keep doing two or three-hour workouts at my rehab gym.) My physical therapy aide and former NFL player, Erroll Tucker , who still encourages me during every weight workout. I’d venture to say that every single one of these Comeback Kids has a lot of heart, but Dwight Kroening completed Ironman Canada after receiving a heart transplant and Wayne “The Dead Guy” Wright completed 50 Marathons in 50 U.S. States this October after undergoing a quadruple bypass. Dennis Tapp found a way to ride his bike across the country with the partial paralysis caused by five gunshots. Sterling Kwong completed Ironman Arizona after battling testicular cancer. Casey Kammel completed Ironman Coeur d'Alene in unique style after being told he’d never walk again. Andy Bailey came back from a life-threatening MRSA infection and amputation to compete in triathlons again (at the age of 70). Pitcher Kara Nilan returned to collegiate play after suffering a traumatic brain injury on the mound. My fellow rehab patient, Lydia , continues to bravely fight cancer on top of the severe back pain from her paragliding accident. And my dear coach, Beth Hibbard , became a pro triathlete after breaking her neck. Tawnee Prazak and Kevin Quadrozzi , I have little doubt
that you’ll both make it to Kona some day. My fellow trail patrol mountain biker, Jane , continues to inspire me as I hit the trails with a little trepidation these days. My friend Laurie shattered some bones in her foot doing an Irish jig, and completed an ultra-marathon less than a year later. Ken Stephenson helped me start this series off with a bang and his brother Brad helped me keep the streak alive. (Yes, there will be something nice for you under the tree, I mean in the fridge, this Christmas!) Some thought their stories and their injuries weren’t that special. From where I sit, they were all special. Every day someone finds this blog because they searched Google for words like “plica syndrome,” “broken collarbone,” or “tibial plateau fracture.” I’ve received thank-you notes from readers – from Colorado to France to South Africa – who have said they were inspired by your stories. You helped me immensely. You helped my friend and his loved ones. You helped keep this magical thing going for 18 weeks until my buddy was discharged from the hospital. Last week, he started walking again with assistance. I look forward to the day when I can write his Comeback Kid story. Until then, I plan to write a few more of these stories in the year ahead. And I thank you for making all of these stories possible. Happy holidays!
I've been thinking lately about what it is that draws a woman to a man and vice-versa? And is there really such a thing as love at first sight??I know for myself, there are certain things that immediately draw me in, and I'm talking pure aesthetics....a great smile (nice teeth), engaging eyes, good skin, nice hands....to name a few. But love?? What is it beyond that immediate attraction that makes someone take a second and a third and a fourth look?People often say that they know within the first 5 minutes whether someone they've met has boyfriend/girlfriend "potential" or not. I think what is more often the case is that you know instantly if someone doesn't have a chance, but not necessarily if they do. Personality is such a HUGE X-factor and it is truly such a variable that I think it's almost impossible to completely rule someone out without having a conversation. And what is an appealing character trait in one person doesn't necessarily carry the same appeal on another. Weird how that is....but when people overlook the fact that someone is rude, thoughtless, selfish, unkind, or disrespectful just to be with the bombshell or the handsome hunk, we know how long those relationships last  - not very!There are certain deal breakers however. Instant No-Can-Dos. Shorter than me? Nope. Unintelligent? I'll pass. Smoke cigarettes? Hell to the no! Now while I don't think I've ever experienced love at first sight, I think I've had lust, lol, but I would never rule out the fact that i
I don't remember the last time I had visited a grave on the Mt. of Olives. Yes, I'd been to Ibrahim's home, but he lives in the neighborhood of the living.&nbsp; I guess I don't know that many holy people.&nbsp; The Mt. of Olives is the world's oldest and holiest Jewish cemetery dating from biblical times.&nbsp; Many holy rabbis over the centuries have been buried there.&nbsp; Even Madonna visited one of the Kabbalah rabbis, when she was here with the Kabbalah center.&nbsp; This past Friday, however, was the anniversary of my friend's son's death&nbsp;5 years ago.&nbsp; He had a rare genetic thing, which left him, since birth, severely handicapped.&nbsp; He never walked or spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he died at the age of 14,&nbsp;he was buried in the Mt. of Olives in a special plot for holy children - those who never spoke bad about anyone.&nbsp; It is a special merit to be buried there because space is limited and is usually reserved for renowned rabbis these days.&nbsp; Legend has it that when the resurrection happens, people buried there will be resurrected first. It was tough on my friend to visit his grave.&nbsp; She lost a son.&nbsp; It is always tough for the living.&nbsp; She knows he is fine, not trapped in a very handicapped body.&nbsp; When she dreams about him, he even&nbsp;speaks to her - something he never did when he was alive.&nbsp; I looked around at the gravestones.&nbsp; Some were so tiny - the babies must have been a few days, weeks or months when they died.&nbsp; Someone pointed out that right behind my friend's son's grave were the graves of the two Holzberg children - the children of the Chassidic couple that was killed&nbsp;during the Mumbai massacre a couple of years ago by Islamic&nbsp;extremists.&nbsp; They had died of illness&nbsp;before the tragedy with their parents&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp; Now they have no parents visiting their graves - only a 4 year old brother and grandparents.&nbsp; After we read the psalms and the quorum of 10 men left, the mother and a few of her friends stayed on to sit and keep this young soul of her son some company.&nbsp; We listened to the mother grieve for her son, for her loneliness and some shared what they felt too. grieving for a loved one &nbsp;I felt serene and there was an atmosphere of contentment sitting around the little souls. tiny grave &nbsp;There were red poppies&nbsp;growing wild by unmarked graves.&nbsp; I looked at the Holzberg graves and told my friend&nbsp;that her son and this&nbsp;boy were now friends and learning chassidut together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cellphones are expensive, but so necessary.&nbsp; I wonder how we managed years ago when we had to depend on pay phones to tell someone we'll be late, or make impulsive, last minute&nbsp;arrangements with friends and relatives.&nbsp; How inconvenient it all was, trying to find that quarter or whatever the cost was then.&nbsp; But my cellphone bill has been expensive of late and so I called up the competitor of my current cell provider.&nbsp; There are three major cellphone companies in Israel, Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange.&nbsp; I got a much better offer from the competitor, after complaining about my current cellphone provider&nbsp;so after a week or so, I got on the phone with my current provider and told them about the offer. Can they match it?&nbsp; Closely.&nbsp; They connected me with a special department called Customer Retention or something like that.&nbsp; I would get a new phone at 50% of the cost.&nbsp; I complained that their competitor offered me a free one.&nbsp; OK - then they'll give me a free one too.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; It sounded so easy! I went to their service store and waited nearly an hour to be seated with one of their reps.&nbsp; They wrote my number down on a piece of paper. I was number 218.&nbsp; Number 211 flashed on the screen but there was no customer.&nbsp; They probably got impatient and left.&nbsp; I could have been crafty and written the number 211 on the other side of the paper to be promptly seated - but I'm too American.&nbsp; Or Canadian.&nbsp; I'll wait my turn, the way civilized people are apt to do.&nbsp; I finally got my turn.&nbsp; The sales rep gets my phone number and asks me questions. "How much did they offer you?" I asked - "Isn't it on the computer?" "Yes, but you're a special case from the retention department.&nbsp; What exactly did they promise you?"&nbsp; I told him. "Yes, you're right" he says - obviously regaining his eyesight, as what they promised was probably on the computer screen all along.&nbsp; I couldn't figure out why they were playing this game. About 5 minutes into this, a woman comes over to me&nbsp;with a typed up survey in her hand - asking me how the service is and how is the sales rep I'm talking to? "Isn't it odd that you're asking me how is he when I'm&nbsp;right in front of him?| "Give me a 10" said the sales rep to me. "Ok, I'll give you a 10, but if I find that you're saying 'ok' to whatever was agreed on the phone and I get a totally different, more expensive,&nbsp;bill, I'm coming back to rate you a 1." "Don't worry.&nbsp; The new rate will show up on your bill." The new rate didn't show up on what I signed, and after I questioned him, he said it was standard.&nbsp; I'll get the new rate on my next bill because I was a "special" case. "So in case you're lying to me, how long am I contracted to you? "18 months" Fine.&nbsp;That's better than the&nbsp;more common&nbsp;3 year contract. &nbsp;If they're a bunch of liars, I'll use my phone minimally and pay the minimum charge and after 18 months switch to another provider.&nbsp; For years, ever since we made aliyah, I was considered by my kids to be so uncool.&nbsp; After all, I&nbsp;am an immigrant, speak Hebrew with an embarrassing accent, plus my grammar is often wrong.&nbsp; I&nbsp;like Western music, Arabs, Arabic music, health food,&nbsp;go to a trippy synagogue in Jerusalem, invite non-Jews for Shabbat dinner, eat in different restaurants all the time,&nbsp;see foreign films and often&nbsp;go alone.&nbsp; My oldest&nbsp;daughter even bought me a birthday gift&nbsp;-&nbsp;a 10-movie package - at&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem's landmark&nbsp; Smadar theater.&nbsp; I love the Smadar.&nbsp; They didn't destroy the Ottomon-era terracotta stone floors and opened up a restaurant attached to the theater.&nbsp; Unlike the cinemateque, you can bring in your beer and cappucino or hot cider - even wine - into the theater.&nbsp; There are others like me who sit alone in the theater.&nbsp; Lately, I saw the movies Push and A Serious Man there.&nbsp; Next week I'm seeing a Korean film with a friend (!).&nbsp; But now, all of a sudden, I'm cool.&nbsp; My complainer daughter hardly complains anymore.&nbsp; She hugs and kisses me daily.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; She has a new boyfriend.&nbsp; This guy comes from a Moroccan family BUT, and here's a big BUT, he enjoys Ashkenazi (European/Western) culture more than his own. He doesn't listen to Middle Eastern music and is astounded that my daughter acts more "Moroccan" than he.&nbsp; It's something he has to get used to, he says.&nbsp; His brother is actually a famous Israeli singer, who still churns out Israeli hits.&nbsp; This new boyfriend loves the Beatles, Doors, Stones and Fats Domino.&nbsp; My daughter doesn't know the songs to any of these.&nbsp; But now she's coming to me to learn this new Western culture her boyfriend is into.&nbsp; She's now proud of her once-uncool mother.&nbsp; I know I'm going to have to bring that photo of Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and me together at an art gallery out of&nbsp; basement storage to impress him. "You're gonna love my mother" she coos to her boyfriend. "you might even want to marry her", she jokes, perhaps knowing a little of my Cougar fantasies. "See?&nbsp; This is how it starts.&nbsp; First you eat like that, and then you start inviting Arabs into the house." griped my son-in-law, as I gave my daughter, his wife, some healing foods for her ulcerative colitis.&nbsp; Brown rice with broccoli and carrots, drizzled with flax seed oil.&nbsp; I was amused by his theory, wondering if it were indeed true. He shook his head.&nbsp; He truly believes that granola eating hippies, like his mother-in-law, weren't always loving and tolerant&nbsp;human beings, but turned that way when they eschewed mostly junk food for a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; His wife was eating crap, like diet soda and fast food nearly every day, and the result is ulcerative colitis, which I'm trying to help her heal through food.&nbsp; And if that will&nbsp;heal&nbsp;her body as well as her soul&nbsp;, then why not?&nbsp; Because she'll turn into me?&nbsp; Is that what he's afraid of?&nbsp; I laughed at the prospect of her turning into a peace-nik and inviting all the Arabs who live in Jabel Mukaber into their tiny West Jerusalem home, and him, another middle-east Archie Bunker, tearing his hair out. My son's school has been calling me all month trying to get me to come to another one of their "emergency" meetings about my son who shows up in school, but hardly in class. "There are&nbsp;teachers who don't even know who he is!" exclaimed his&nbsp;principal. I tell the principal's secretary that I can't make it on the Sunday she wants me to come because my boss has a slew of meetings that day, and I have to prepare her on that day. "Isn't your son important to you?&nbsp; Don't you even care?&nbsp; Is your job so much more &nbsp;important than your own son?&nbsp; We made this meeting with a lot of people involved and that's when they could come!!"&nbsp; The principal's secretary is actually screaming at me.&nbsp; I look at the phone.&nbsp; I'm totally pissed.&nbsp; She continues, "they want to throw him out of school.&nbsp; Don't you think that's important?" I glare into the phone.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she can't see me gritting my teeth. "You never asked ME when "I" can make it.&nbsp; Keeping my job is showing my kids how responsible I am.&nbsp; If I don't have my job, then we'll be living in the streets.&nbsp;I'm not ready to sacrifice my job for a meeting in school.&nbsp; Sorry." I think she was shocked by my response.&nbsp; There was silence on the other end of the line. I&nbsp;continued.&nbsp; "If you want to throw him out of school, it will just have to wait another week." I shouted back at the secretary.&nbsp; I made the appointment for the week after, when my boss will be out of town. That afternoon I went into the local mall where one of the shops was selling pillows.&nbsp; My kids were all sleeping on pillows that had seen better days.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that day, I was only buying for&nbsp;one of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ask her to show me a selection for my 20 year old daughter.&nbsp; The shopkeeper shows me a latex pillow that is the most expensive one in the store. "It's quite a lot of money." I complained to her.&nbsp; "I'd like to buy her a mid-range one.&nbsp; Not the cheapest and not the most expensive." She looked at me funny. "But it's your daughter!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't she worth the best?" I looked at the shopkeeper funny. "Absolutely not." And then I walked out of the store, seeing the shopkeeper's mouth still open.... here in the Holy Land, we are basking in the sun.&nbsp; I usually don't like to make you people living with cold weather jealous, but today I'll make an exception. We ate at Bariba overlooking the Yarkon River and Reading plant Mullet fish over risotto in saffron sauce The best mushroom gnocchi I've ever tasted covered with Parmesean foam (!) All sorts of people passed by That dog wants ice cream some people went boating some kids went swimming The Farmers Market was in full swing one of Hubby's favorite stores on Dizengoff Street with the latest fashion in undies (if you can call them that) Road signs wishing travellers a Shabbat Shalom I prepared so well, I thought, for the upcoming ticket sales in Israel for the Elton John concert in June.&nbsp; I read the reports&nbsp; of groups trying to get him to boycott Israel.&nbsp; Yawn.&nbsp; This is getting boring already.&nbsp; They do this to every celebrity who books concerts here.&nbsp; Most ignore the boycott pleas and threats.&nbsp; I hope Elton has the balls to pay no heed to these party poopers.&nbsp; Cancelling a concert will not make things better for Palestinians in this country.&nbsp; It'll just piss me off and probably a few other peacemakers too.&nbsp; But getting back to the tickets...Advance ticket sales were available to Bank Discount members beginning from 7:00 pm last night.&nbsp; I'm a member (or rather my husband is) - even though that bank pisses me off - except when they give their members perks such as this.&nbsp; &nbsp;I called up the bank last week to make sure that&nbsp;my credit&nbsp;card was open and ok to accept purchases.&nbsp; After all, it has been over a year since I used it.&nbsp; The bank clerk told me that there is no problem with the card.&nbsp; Yesterday I called another bank clerk to get more credit in case I want to buy more than 4 tickets.&nbsp; He said everything is fine.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; I'm ready. I did some errands then came back to the office at 6:45 pm and got the website ready on my computer.&nbsp; Of course by the time 7:00 pm rolled around, it took me 20 minutes to get onto the site.&nbsp; I finally got in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yay!&nbsp; I filled out all the information they needed, picked out some fabulous seats in the front row on the side of the stage - very close to the stage, in fact - &nbsp;and then took my credit card out.&nbsp; I plugged in the numbers, my ID number, etc. and then I saw the expiry date.&nbsp; I look at the card - remember, I had been planning this for a week already - and the expiry date says 09/09.&nbsp; SHIT!&nbsp; I tried putting in a random expiry date, but the computer is smart.&nbsp; It doesn't take my card.&nbsp; I use the other Visa I have, but the computer insists I use the Bank Discount credit card.&nbsp; I leave the webpage open, just in case I never get in again because of all the people trying to buy tickets at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to think fast.&nbsp; I call up the credit card company.&nbsp; I'm frantic.&nbsp; I'm wondering if there are more frantic people calling them about Elton John. "Look, I'm trying to buy Elton John tickets, and my visa date expired.&nbsp; Can you give me a new updated date?&nbsp; Please?" It&nbsp;seems hopeful at first while the clerk puts me on hold probably to speak to his manager.&nbsp; He comes back on. "Sorry. You have to speak to your bank about this.&nbsp; We don't give new expiry dates." "But my bank doesn't open until 8:30 in the morning" I wailed. "Can't you give me a temporary one?" "No.&nbsp; I'm so sorry."&nbsp; He really sounded sympathetic.&nbsp; But there was no point in arguing with him.&nbsp; I had to think quickly while the ticket sales website was still on the payment page.&nbsp; AH!&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered that a good&nbsp;friend of mine has a Discount Visa.&nbsp; We tried doing this together, but she had a difficult time with the Hebrew instructions.&nbsp; I guided her through but the transaction failed.&nbsp; She doesn't have enough credit on her card. Never give up.&nbsp; My Complainer daughter has to do something good for her mother, doesn't she, instead of chronically complaining all the time.&nbsp; I call her several times.&nbsp; She doesn't answer her phone.&nbsp; It's 8:00 pm, and no tickets.&nbsp; I go out for dinner with friends.&nbsp; My daughter calls and apologizes (!). She was working and couldn't answer her phone, but if I'm in town, we can go home together. Yes, and I could take your Visa, I thought.&nbsp; She didn't complain when I asked her for it.&nbsp; Not a flinch.&nbsp; When I arrived home after midnight I went into my son's room where the computer is.&nbsp; I let him rant and rave about me making noise.&nbsp; I tried to bribe him with concert tickets but he's not interested.&nbsp; I finally get into the site.&nbsp; Most of the great seats are gone - except for the very expensive lawn seats.&nbsp; I get a gate close to the stage, but 23 rows up.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; Not as great as I could have gotten had I had an updated credit card, but they were good nevertheless. So Elton, hang on....it'll be a rocky road with every asshole trying to get
you to cancel the concert.&nbsp; Don't listen to anyone.&nbsp; Just do what you have to do so we can all have a great time together.... Be careful who you start conversations with standing at bus stops.&nbsp; It's not like people are dangerous here.&nbsp; They aren't.&nbsp; And it's easy to jump into a&nbsp;stranger's conversation.&nbsp; The stranger who is talking usually looks around and talks to whoever is standing around.&nbsp; Some are receptive and sometimes one can engage in fun conversation about all sorts of things while waiting for the bus. So yesterday I jumped into a bus stop conversation about People.&nbsp; Persian people and then Russian people. "Not all of them are bad" said a woman to a man. "You always get one bad apple in the tree" the man answered. I interjected in Hebrew, "Well, what do you think about Canadians?" Bad move on my part.&nbsp; The man continued his tirade all throughout the 40 minute bus ride with me about his Canadian neighbor whose dog barked outside every&nbsp;day at 4:00 am.&nbsp; "I told her I was going to kill the dog."&nbsp; He leered at me.&nbsp; He clearly isn't too fond of Canadians.&nbsp; Then he went on about putting talcum powder on the floor and I couldn't understand half of what he was saying.&nbsp; I really just wanted to relax on the bus ride home and not talk to anyone.&nbsp; I got home and tried to make dinner.&nbsp; The two men in the family began bickering. "Who ate my cookies?" demanded Hubby.&nbsp; Someone at work made chocolate chip cookies for me&nbsp;for my birthday&nbsp; I brought them home and told Hubby that they were for him for HIS birthday this week.&nbsp; He was so happy.&nbsp; Before the cookies were eaten, that is.&nbsp; My son admitted to the crime.&nbsp; "There were only 10 left!" "10!!!&nbsp; YOU ATE ALL 10???? YOU PIG!!!" and a war of the words started, with name calling back and forth, which ended up with my son throwing Hubby's files out of our son's room, where they are kept, and then Hubby taking the computer monitor out of our son's room and putting it into our locked storage room. And then I thought it is much easier dealing with strangers on the bus, who can talk the ass out of a turkey, than this. It was bad enough when the water stopped running right before the Sabbath.&nbsp; I was about to put on the slow cooker a dish called Hamin, which takes overnight to cook, and consists of everything basically - meat, chicken, beans, potatoes, stuffing, barley, and seasoned either sweet or salty or middle eastern.&nbsp; The water shut off just as I was about to wash a bunch of scallions.&nbsp; I was horrified.&nbsp; I ended up washing the scallions in a pot full of water that had cooked the artichokes.&nbsp; I felt good.&nbsp; I was recycling.&nbsp; The neighbors kept on going onto the roof to see if they could fix the water thing (whatever it's called),&nbsp;while the rain was pouring down at the same time.&nbsp; For a few minutes they were successful and then --- no water from the taps.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; We thought of a weekend with toilets full of shit and family members in sore need of a shower. "I have my PERIOD!!" shouted one of my daughters during the meal. "What's a period?" asked my bright 18 year old son.&nbsp; He had no idea what that word meant in English. "YOU tell him" I ordered my son-in-law. But before our meal, while this water shortage thing was going on, I had smelled smoke coming from the air vents.&nbsp; I panicked because Hubby was over at my married daughter's house in Jerusalem and called the fire department.&nbsp; Two men came into the house, looking like professional ...ghostbusters or whatever.&nbsp; Oxygen tanks on their backs, contraptions which measure or find the source of the smoke.&nbsp; The odor was quite strong.&nbsp; They were with me in the apartment for a good 20 minutes.&nbsp; Then I lift up one of my pots that was on the stove and see a little rattan coaster sticking to the bottom of the pot.&nbsp; It was burnt to a crisp.&nbsp; I found the culprit and I felt so stupid.&nbsp; The firemen looked at me and smiled.&nbsp; They must go through this often, I thought&nbsp;(perhaps others would be as mindless as myself). Meanwhile, Hubby returned as the men were leaving.&nbsp; He didn't care if the house was burning - he was just thrilled to be able to eat&nbsp;on paper plates, as his dishwashing duties was temporarily suspended.
the Novelista Barista today featured me in her blog. I am extremely flattered by what she had to say. Take a look!A 'catch-up' post is on the way, probably tomorrow... watch this space! x When I'm in Malta, I generally avoid shopping like the plague. Not only are most prices higher, the Euro isn't exactly in my favour either. But last time I was there, I was determined to get my hands on the new Chasing Pandora CD, The Driver and the Dancer. And ever since then, I haven't really been able to turn it off. The Distance Between Us is one of my very favourite songs off the album (although I love them all, which I cannot often say about an album). Unfortunately I haven't been able to find the video online, but the entire CD can be heard (free!) on their website. musically,
Added in a couple of items to the Tiny Lifestyle Changes today. One I’ve been doing for a while and it is working well for me. The other is a suggestion made by my associate rector, Matt, and it’s the kind of thing that would work for me if I did it regularly so I’m going to make the attempt to do that too. The one that I’m already doing is from my pastoral counselor. He suggested that to handle stress and anxiety, since it was keeping me awake at night, I should turn over to God the things that were bothering me most. He suggested a journal, but I’m just doing it in prayer. I’ve been negligent of my prayer life, so this is a good way to get back in the habit of talking to God. When I was a new believer I used to fall asleep reading his word. I sort of miss that comfort and I hope this tiny step will lead me back to that, or at least to more consideration in the quiet of the evening when I’m lying there trying to shut down my day. Last Sunday Matt gave a really good sermon on that included 2 midrash. That’s may not be spelled correctly and it’s not the plural form. He told us during the sermon but I didn’t get that bit down. One of the midrash talked about the space between the lines of text in the Torah being the place where the true meaning was to be found. Then he talked about the name of God as it is in Hebrew YHVH, which is never spoken, and what the sound might be if we did try to pronounce it. Without the vowels that Christians have added in it sounds sort of like breathy sounds that one hears. The PH sound, the H sound, maybe some of the S, those where you are exhaling strongly. I kind of laughed when he first did that and tried to say it without the vowels. It sounded like a bit from Harry Potter. Then as his lesson continued I came to think, the breath sound might represent the breath of life that God gives us or that energy which was sent forth from God when he made the world. If that’s what we find in the quiet spaces maybe it’s a good idea that I go back and reread my priests’ sermons so that I can reflect on their teachings and gain what is between the lines of text. And that’s the second item I added into Tiny Lifestyle Changes. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! If you’ve read my blog a lot in the past you know I like to think back on things and see what effect they’ve had on my life. This is a skill I learned late in life. It was something I had to do for some college classes and believe I’m much the better for having gained it. The process was called reflection. Reflection has given me lots of awareness on how things affect others too. When I was a child I didn’t spend time analyzing other people’s actions or emotions until it affected me and then it was usually a frenzy of trying to look at why they did or said whatever it was that had hurt me so badly. That’s not socially helpful, but it let me express my angst till I’d owned it and come to a better understanding of the situation. Thankfully I’ve grown some since those anxious teenage years. These days I try to understand the other person’s needs or behaviors based on what I know of them and not how I feel. It helps a bunch because I’ve come to love harmony in my life, a gift from Mom, and hopefully that longing for peace and harmony makes me more of a peacemaker than an irritant to any situation I run into. This morning I was reading an article from WebMD that talked about a study researching the effects of darkness on people’s behavior. It said that when the room is darkened, not lightless but dim light, or people wore sunglasses they might behave in a less ethical manner. I found that very interesting and suddenly I was imagining what I might say to a child who wanted to wear sunglasses all the time because he, “thought it made him look cool” because another kid he knew wore them and he thought that kid was cool. I guess our teachers were right; you shouldn’t wear sunglasses all the time. Since the eyes are windows to our heart and mind, if someone feels you can’t see what he’s thinking or feeling he feels anonymous and can thus act in ways that might not be right but won’t be attributed to him because of that self perceived anonymity. I think I can understand how a kid might want to be anonymous if he’s constantly being corrected for things he does. We probably all experience times like that as adults too. But knowing this means it’s important to look people in the eyes to really know them, that it can’t be done by just hearing their words without knowing the emotions behind them, or maybe the experiences that have generated their response to a situation. That’s not always easy to know even when you do look someone in the eye, but it gives you the opportunity to ask them for more so that they can express themselves and feel heard. I think that’s called active listening today and we all know how much we want to be heard when we are struggling. I want to go back to that darkness article and think up some more ways that it can affect us so I guess I’ll find a friend I can discuss that with, or maybe my counselor since he’s good at role play too. If you read the article on darkness and come up with any insights I hope you’ll share them. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! It’s true! I’m almost giddy I’m so happy. This isn’t because of anything that’s happened. No major event triggered this. I think it’s the result of some small changes I made in my routine recently that have just triggered a good feeling within my spirit. The changes I made were very small. I’ve been dealing with depression ever since my marriage broke up in ‘99. I have a good counselor and maybe a very smart psychiatrist who prescribes my medication. So for the past 3 days I’ve been on a very small dose of Bupropion. Just 100 mg a day, extended release. This dose is small enough to not cause that edgy feeling that this drug is known for but it helps lift my spirits. I think it is taking effect. But I don’t think that alone has triggered this surfeit of happiness. The next change I made was last night’s routine. It was cold in the apartment so I took out time in the middle of the evening to draw and take a warm bath. I washed my hair and when I was through I put on comfy clothes and went to bed at my usual time, hair still wet but combed. When I woke up this morning I had more time in my routine to do stuff I wanted to do instead of feeling the need to get ready for work. My hair was dry and fluffy, call that wash and sleep. LOL More time gives you a relaxed feeling about your day so that’s going to become a more regular change I think. Bath at night and ready faster in the morning. Plus I think I slept better for that. Good sleep gives me a much better mood. Then I elected to dress comfortably for work. I work in a business casual environment and some of my coworkers wear suits. I would have loved jeans today but it’s not jeans day so I pulled out an old pair of loose fitting pants that still looked good and topped them with one of those thin flannel shirts that gives you lots of room to move. Added a belt and I”m ready for for anything and can move comfortably without care to whether I’m sitting like a proper lady and feeling cuddled in that flannel. I think that finished the mood lift. So clean, rested, comfortable, and ready to face the day. I attribute some of this to the Happiness Project . And I’m going to continue to read that blog because I keep finding good suggestions in it that lift my mood. Hope your day goes as good as I anticipate mine will. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! Even though they’d been sniffing noses through the screen door and seemed interested in being friends, when I adopted Hooboo, rescuing him from his “stray porch kitty” status, he and Hyram developed an instant competition. They fought, Hyram stole Hooboo’s food, Hooboo would steal the wrap around my ankles time, and they’d rarely share a bed together. Hyram actually kept watch for Hooboo’s arrival and left when he entered the room. That is until recently. I don’t know what changed but for the past two nights I’ve had both cats on the bed. Sunday night it was one on either side of me. Last night they were actually sharing the comforter and less than a foot apart. Dare I hope that I’ve now got a cat family? In other news I’m fighting a cold and it’s taking its usual course. Following a nurse friend’s advice I was trying to “let it run through me” and avoiding decongestants until the need for sleep precluded that and I gave in. Prayers for health are appreciated. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! Recently I updated to the latest (greatest?) version of Firefox, that being version 3.6. It immediately disabled IE Tab and one or two other extensions a.k.a. add-ons. Oops! I’d been using IE Tab to see my blog because I thought there had been a problem with Firefox and Blogger. I’d been losing the right hand column of my blog in Firefox and IE Tab was my current workaround. Then last night I opened and read Sandi’s blog and heard her playlist which she has on the right side (same as I do) and wondered why I could hear her blog and not mine. So I started researching. The first thing I did was email Terry to see if he had any advice. He took a look, with 4 different browsers no less, and had no problems with my blog so he suggested I clear the cache. That’s Blogger’s usual advice too so I tried it but it didn’t help. Then I got a clever idea. Why not try disabling add-ons to see if any of them were the problem. Wow, what I discovered would make almost 2 posts. First off I had way too many Java Consoles installed. Apparently when you update Java it doesn’t overwrite the old console but just adds a new one on. I’m down to just the latest Java Console and the Java Quick Start add-on. That works fine so no problem there. Then I disabled everything else and restarted the browser. My blog showed fully and the playlist I’d been missing played beautifully. So I started enabling add-ons one at a time and found the culprit. It was Ad Block Plus. That’s a sweet add-on and I’m going to miss it because I hate ads being stuck willy nilly all over the pages I’m viewing and this baby took care of that. But lately it seems to be messing with Java and Flash content so I guess I’m better off without. Then I googled “Firefox add-ons that cause problems with blogger” and got this fantastic page by Mozilla. It lists the extensions that cause problems, what they mess up, and gives a workaround. How helpful of them to put that up. It was even dated as recent as December 10, 2009 so it’s very current. Yes, Adblock and Adblock Plus were on the list. It also told me why my browser sometimes gave a message of Firefox is still running when I’d shut it down and then tried to restart it. That little snafu was thanks to Cooliris which is another neat add-on but I can do without too. So that’s gone now too. Now my add-on list is much pared down and I’m happy with the way the browser is working again. I hope that link helps if you are having any problems with Firefox. Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy! It’s raining this morning, and in addition to the loving behavior of my younger cat Hooboo making bread on my shoulder before settling down on top of me to await my arousal, I woke to thinking about blogging. It’s been more than a month since I wrote anything and I apologize to all of you who’ve been checking in from time to time. I titled this the “Season of Bloglessness” because I’m not the only one who hasn’t been blogging lately. My friend Susan just posted after an absence of over two weeks and my good friend Sandi has been absent from blog land for almost as long. I’ll let you read Susan’s blog to find out what she’s been up to. Sandi on the other hand is very busy with a no longer empty nest. Her son Wallace has moved back in. I’ll let Sandi tell you the story but you need to know that her life is doing all kinds of adjusting right now, so if you read her blog please take the time to drop by and give her support. I know she means to get back to blogging sometime soon but her computer is in what is now Wallace’s bedroom. My job is going well. I love what I’m doing and the people I’m working with. Thank you for being so faithful. I’ll try to write again soon with pictures of the Christmas Poinsettias I was gifted with. Blessings for now. Life got rather busy a few weeks ago. I mentioned in an earlier post that the Census had called and asked me to work for them again. The job kept getting postponed for a couple of weeks and that frustrated me some at the time. But the work finally started and it is still as much fun as it was earlier this year. The slow spell of the summer is over and we are gearing up to hire a lot of folk for the upcoming census taking. If you want a temporary job that pays fairly well and helps your government put resources where they are needed most then click here . One of the nice things I like about this job is there is so much to learn about the project. I’m a perpetual student and excel in learning environments. This one has a lot to teach me. The fact that we do a Census every 10 years is dictated by law. I believe it’s written into the Constitution. There is a deadline for it. The Census totals need to be on President Obama’s desk on a specific date in the middle of next December. The goal is to do a better job of counting every person in the country than they did in past decades. We are aiming for 100%! That 100 percent isn’t just those of us who live in houses or apartments. It includes trailer parks too. That I could have figured out. But for some reason I hadn’t figured on them counting campground dwellers, boat owners who live in them on the water, and people in care facilities like hospitals, retirement communities, and jails. And then there are the people who live in shelters, under bridges and overpasses, and in boxes. Yep, we plan on counting them too. That thought brings to mind an old black and white movie image of hoboes around a campfire. I wonder if they will search railroad cars for people. That’s the main news on my front. I’m busy and feeling good about it. Yay! Other news is that my list of friends on Facebook has grown. A bit of that is thanks to Classmates.com. I’m reconnected with a few folks in my high school graduating class. That’s kind of neat and I’ll probably try to go to a reunion when they hold it. On a more interactive front an old college chum got in touch with me the same way. I'd not heard from Harry in something close to 30 years but we were great friends when we attended the same college. He’s doing well and is in town for the holidays to see his Mum. We are meeting for lunch tomorrow. I wonder what we will talk about. My Dad sent me a box full of pictures from the family collection. He is scanning them into his computer and was just going to toss them so I asked if I could have them instead. Yeah, I love a digital image and can look at one for hours if it’s really good. But just like books, a real photograph printed on paper is somehow more tangible and generates strong memories and emotions. Guess I”m just an old fashioned girl when it comes to some things. I guess the last bit of news is that tonight I’m attending a Celtic Christmas Concert at my church. The music I’ll hear is going to be performed by Jeff Johnson, Brian Dunning, and Wendy Goodwin. I hope to come away with a CD or two of their music. If you want to listen to some clips of their stuff the website is here . I’ll try to write about the concert and my impressions later this week. Peace, Hope &amp; Joy! Wednesday evening is practice night for my church choir, of which I’ve been a member for about a year. These days we are gearing up for the annual Lessons &amp; Carols service. It’s exciting because there are always lots of new numbers to sing and it is the choir showcase service. We are also thinking ahead to Christmas Eve service which also has lots of music in it. Our choir director asked if any of us would be interested in doing some group numbers, not exactly solos but still out front and I said count me in. So this Christmas I may be part of a trio singing a medley of carols. When choir practice was over we had a birthday celebration for anyone who’s birthday is in November and those we’d missed earlier in the year. This is renewing an old tradition among our group that fell into disuse and I
think we are all happy to have it back again. Everybody should have their special day. The members who volunteered to sponsor this month’s celebration brought wine, desserts, and some nice crackers, chips, and dips. It was all good. Then we left for the evening. Outside our sanctuary door there’s a motion activated security light. It’s dark earlier these days so I was glad that it came on as I headed out to my car. But apparently someone in the world wasn’t so happy. As I passed the tree on the corner of the building I heard a sound I’d never heard before. It was a sort of hooting. I stopped and listened and it happened again and again. It was an owl protesting about light disturbing his peace. In all my life I can’t remember ever having heard an owl before, but I recognized it immediately. Perhaps there’s no other bird that sounds like that. Maybe it’s so distinctive that once you’ve been told what an owl sounds like you can’t mistake that sound for any other bird. The moment made me feel very good. To know that nature was out there and active, that a bird I tend to think of as a wilderness creature was on our church grounds, made me aware of how special our sanctuary and grounds are. Whenever I’m on our campus I feel blessed. There’s this feeling that just seems to fill the grounds up, not just the sanctuary. We call ourselves reconcilers and I think that sound served to remind me that we reconcile ourselves to nature too. The Happiness Project had an interesting post the other day about de-cluttering. It was rules to not follow. In it Gretchen gave Eleven Myths of De-cluttering along with how we should not follow those old beliefs and why. I was surprised to find these out and have to admit that I’m guilty of believing and practicing many of them. Maybe I can try out these new methods and get better results. What do you think? Are you guilty of any of these? Peace! Hope! &amp; Joy!
When the Brisbane Roar had finished their practice session we decided to go over to see if we could meet some players. Geraldo was particularly interested in meeting some Brazilian players who were on the team. Most of the players had gone into the change room by the time we had walked over from the other side of the stadium but we were lucky enough to meet a couple of the Brazilian players who were talking to the coach. I told them that Geraldo was a top ranking soccer player in his hometown in Vanuatu and they were very friendly and were happy for us to take some snaps. The coach whose name was Kenny seemed very interested in Geraldo and he suggested I call his friend, David, a soccer coach at the Academy of Sport to see if he could include Geraldo in some training sessions before he went back to Vanuatu which was a week away. He said there was another Ni-Van boy who was in the training squad there. Wow we couldn't believe our luck! We managed to get another photo of Geraldo with a gorgeous Aussie player before we left. We drove over to Ballymore Stadium which wasn't too far and found out the Brisbane Roar did their soccer training at 9:30am in the morning so we all came back the next day to see them practice. Geraldo was very excited and watched them intensely. We decided that since Geraldo was such a keen soccer player that we should take him for a visit to the Suncorp Stadium where the big soccer games are played. The stadium itself was locked up but we could see into it from the stadium shop. Of course the stadiums in Vanuatu don't look like this! The fellas who were serving in the shop were very friendly and when we told them that Geraldo was a soccer player from Vanuatu they suggested we take him to another stadium called Ballymore where the Brisbane Roar, Brisbane's top soccer team, practised. On the way home on the CityCat Geraldo was in high spirits. He was really enjoying his stay with us in Brisbane! Our next excursion with Geraldo was to take him to the cinema. Geraldo had watched plenty of DVDs but had never been to a cinema before as there aren't any in Vanuatu. We chose to take him to a 3D screening of Avatar at South Bank which pretty much blew his mind. For the best view of Brisbane we drove Geraldo up to the Mt Cootha lookout. There are wonderful views of the city and surrounding areas. You can see as far as the Glass House Mountains to the North, the Gold Coast Hinterland to the South and Moreton and Stradbroke Islands to the East. As usual he was pretty knocked out! We actually managed to spot our house through binoculars. After our bike run we decided to take Geraldo to Kangaroo Point to check out the views. Kangaroo Point is situated on top of a cliff which is now the major rock climbing attraction for Brisbane's abseilers. Geraldo was pretty keen on the view. Geraldo was really overwhelmed by South Bank. He just kept saying "Oh Man!!" He just loved the man made swimming beach. The beach consists of a beautiful clear fresh water lagoon with views over the Brisbane River to the city. Surrounding landscape consists of white sandy beaches, bubbling creeks and shady tropical gardens. He couldn't believe the children's water playground either which I have to admit is pretty cool.
My mom came up to the city over the weekend to celebrate her birthday. The weather was gorgeous and we ended the afternoon with tea and cupcakes. Millie and I are planning a trip to Madrid and Paris later this year. I know it's a ways off but working at a hospital requires quite a bit of notice when I need an extended period of time off, at least according to my boss. Of course I'm getting antsy and ready for another vacation even though I was recently abroad; must be Spring Fever, or just my constant urge to travel. This picture is from a brief trip I took to Barcelona a few years ago, the nouveau architecture was so gorgeous. At least I have several months to practice my Spanish. I think about you all the time and wish you were still here. I went to see my friend Joyce this past weekend in Palo Alto. We went to some consignment shops loaded with designer goodies and I managed to get a practically brand new Chanel bag for just over $100. While on our little thrifting spree we drove past this amazing apartment building where I had to stop and get a closer look, I felt like I was back in Paris. I've been thinking about painting my living room coral or a salmon color which is what I did in my last apartment. It's pretty, goes well with antiques, and it's a soothing color. My only reservations are that I've been living in my place for 7 years and hate the idea of moving everything and taking all my pictures down even though my walls are dingy and could really use some fresh paint. Maybe I'll decide by spring time. The fashion world will not be the same without you.
You're in Austin. You're about to see an ass load of indie bands perform out of every nook and cranny of this city. It's 95 degrees, then it suddenly hails, then it goes back to 95 degrees with a humidity index of 99%. You spot a boy who wears a smaller jean size than you and you are determined to make out with him by the end of the night. It's late, you're drunk off of Lone Stars because you only had seven breakfast tacos about twelve hours ago, and you have blisters lining the bottom of your feet. These are questions and scenarios that will arise this week during SXSW. Don't be unprepared! Follow my survival guide list below and you're sure to have a worth-while and healthy SXSW experience. 1.) The Fanny Pack - Fuck purses. Who said these ever went out of style? WHO? TELL ME! I recommend the American Apparel shiny denim fanny pack in royal blue because it's awe-inspiring. Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Pretty. 2 .) A Pair of Tom's Shoes - Never mind. These hipster staples are like having a thin layer of burlap separating you from the ground. I can't believe they're donated to a child every time a pair is sold. The next generation is going to grow up all jacked with arthritis. (-this statement is in jest...Tom's is a great company that does a lot of wonderful things) 3.) Cheap Brightly Colored Wayfarers - Because in a way we're all still stuck in 2004, aren't we? 4.) Cardigan - Texas weather is known to be a fickle one, so make sure to carry around a cardigan with you for night or when it spontaneously rains though the precipitation level is 0%. Also, throwing on a cardigan over any shitty ol' outfit, will suddenly make you look more intelligent than you actually are. 5.) Clean Underwear - 'Cause Lord only knows what you're going to do with your current pair of underwear. 6.) Scrunchies - Ladies, you make fun of them, but you know you secretly love them. Who is going to hold back your hair when you're puking up all that free Hornito's in the Beauty Bar toliet? Not that DJ with the florescent bike cap. He's been eyeing the girl with the non-prescription horn-rimmed glasses that are over-taking her face all night. You always have a friend in the scrunchie.&nbsp; 7.) Fake Mustache - Because you don't want to feel left out in this city. 8.) Business Cards - Business cards legitimize you. Even if you have nothing to sell.&nbsp; 9.) Granola Bars - The nice thing about Austin is that we're not a bunch of assholes that bump up the price of everything while you're visiting. However, your eating times might be off and in order to not get wasted by 4PM, it's worth carrying some snacks around with you (Dear Lord. I sound like my mother). 10.) Water- Blah blah blah boring 11.) $1's - For when you wander off alone to the strip club near the airport during a drunken blackout. Right, Marcos? 12.) Air Mattress - Often enough couches are better than air mattresses. Most of the time you wake on the hard wood floor, the mattress having deflated like that of your hard-on after popping way too many Adderall. However, the couch might already be taken by the time you get there, so make sure you come prepared.&nbsp; 13.) Chapstic k - Because by the end of the night, your mouth is going to look like that of a crusty crack addict. 14.) Condoms 15.) Diana Camera - To commemorate the night you get shit-faced with Bill Murray or corner David Byrne up against a wall and explain to him how you two were always meant to be together...in lo-fi. Not that long ago, I received an email from an Austin-based musician very eloquently sharing with me the day he realized he was a hipster. His words were poignant, describing his realization as though he was suddenly inflicted with an incurable disease- Hipstermystalacosis. I related to his story and I think you will too. When I was thirteen and running around in suspenders and non-prescription eyeglasses, I knew there was a name for me. For years I fought the label, but gave up my denial of being a hipster when I christened the name of my blog Hipstercrite. Now when someone calls me a hipster, I shake my head in agreement. I am a hipster and probably always will be. Hipsters, stand up tall! Unite! Dear Lauren, I've been an admirer of your page for a few months. I was linked through "TapeBombs," a music blog run by an acquaintance of mine. Like you, I am dangerously preoccupied with hipsterism and spend a good deal of my day confronting the issue. The reason I am mailing is because I think I represent an interesting case study: a person caught in the paralyzing fear of his latent hipsterism and shocked into his true identity by a harrowing event. Here is my account: I was riding my bike down Duval and the sun was out. At this point I believed firmly in my individuality. Of course, my handlebar wrap matched my brake housing, and the same with the metal cages that held my water bottles; all were red. I wore purple shoes and no helmet. The memory of a triumphant sexual encounter arose quickly, then left. I was pleased with my performance and didn't dwell on the details, didn't analyze a thing. I only recalled the sensations and sounds that make good sex memorable. The day was warm. Readjusting my fingers on bar, I found them to be quite cool; I hadn't begun to sweat. The best part of the ride. In the first few seconds of what would be the minute and a half that changed my life, I didn't recognize the origin of the rumble, growing closer, rapidly becoming a roar, like the slow onset of a far off thunderclap. The sound came from the twin tail pipes of a Chevy Diesel truck. Suddenly, they were upon me. As I turned down a steep hill near 51st and Lamar, I was forced against the curb. The huge wheels of the truck kicked up dust and rocks and I was struck by a few of them. A large white male leaned out of the passenger window, ejecting a thimble-full of spit across the front of my shirt. A beer bottle whizzed over my head. I felt like a frightened Russian Hussar riding against Napoleon, holding out my hand as if to protect myself from the zip of bullets and the whistle of passing artillery. At this point, about a foot separated my handle-bars and the side of the truck. After a few more terrifying seconds, the truck sped up quickly, finishing the descent and pulling into a parking lot at the bottom of the hill. I knew what they had in mind. But remember, I was not some pussy hipster. I was not androgynous. I was a man. That archaic sense of honor strengthened me. Four men stepped out (the type of men who buy their groceries at the county feed store). They came at me from thirty yards away, not running, but at a kind of a trot, like this was a leisure activity. I lept off of my bike and approached them in the middle of the lot. I put my dukes up, lithely shifting from side to side with the assured stance of an experienced boxer. I think they sensed my confidence, baseless as it was. They stopped about ten feet away. I held my ground. Each wore what looked to be an Ed Hardy tee. Only I didn't sense the danger then. I was like a cornered puma, fiercer because death clears away the vale of fear. Underneath the decorated tees, the four mens limbs were taut and ready. One word, one altered expression would have uncapped that explosive energy. But there was silence. The crack of bat, followed by childrens laughter, echoed from the top of the hill. We measured one another. It was the leader who broke the silence. His followers relaxed. The engagement was apparently broken off, or at least postponed for a moment. He said, " Fuck you, limp dicked hipster." His friends didn't laugh, but chimed in. "Pussy! Hipster! Faggot!" I didn't reply. I had relaxed my stance. The passenger side agitator spat at me again, but missed. Twenty seconds later the truck was gone and I was left alone in the bright sun. My world view was completely fucking shattered. What passed through my mind as I gingerly pedaled home was not so much the glorious afterglow of a manly confrontation, but the providential nature of my lot in life. I knew that, so far as the outside world was concerned, I was a hipster. Whatever innate qualities I possessed were in dichotomous opposition to a certain portion of society, whose hatred of my "type" acted as a form of self-actualization. This tension was absolutely necessary, and in a larger sense, determined my ultimate role in history. I still have not recovered, not fully. Now, when I listen to my own music, songs like "Don't Try and Take My Guns," "Burning Panties," and "You Should Start A Band," I do not hear the voice of myself, but someone who struggles to hide the mark of an old wound. And while I am ashamed and at times it all seems clownish and sad, I remember that this is what makes good art - that is, fear and its poignant beauty, like a shivering mouse you've caught in a beam of light. My story is that of the reluctant hipster. In your word, "pretending we're not hipsters is what we do best." In this way, I am surely the most resourceful of hipsters. But, unlike so many others, it has enriched my art and given me a new purpose; or more nearly, an enhanced clarity of vision. Sincerely, Marshall Galactic of The Frontier Brothers Marshall Galatic is from the Austin-based band The Frontier Brothers . You can catch them during SXSW at these shows: Mar 16 2010 8:00P Chupacabra Cantina - From the Mind of Adi Showcase w/Peter and the Wolf Mar 18 2010 1:00P 21st St Co-op Dayparty w/Motel Aviv, Black Taxi, and Federal!

Stopped at a traffic light last Friday afternoon, I glanced up at a familiar restaurant marquee that usually carried a quip relating to the latest music festival/bike rally/music rally/bike festival in Austin that week. However, this time the words bore a different sentiment: "Go Texas! Win it for Leslie !" The light turned green and I found myself driving south down Congress Avenue with tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids. Every Austinite knows who Leslie is. He is the city mascot. The epitome of what makes Austin unique. For those who do not know him, Leslie Cochran is a homeless man who wears a leopard print thong. He has run for city mayor multiple times and has been reviewed 53 times on Yelp . He is an extremely articulate and sweet-natured man. No one has a bad thing to say about Leslie. Which is why it's so surprising that unnamed assailants beat Leslie to unconsciousness two weeks ago. Leslie was in bad shape and listed in critical condition. The townspeople formed a vigil and the local news gave daily updates on his health. It was looking like Leslie was not going to make it, but miraculously he pulled through and was released from the hospital last week. He has since thanked the locals for their support, stating that he would have not made it through otherwise. Though a percentage of his medical bills have been taken care of, there will be a fundraiser on November 1st to help pay the rest. By the time I read the sign last Friday, I knew that Leslie was alive and well. What made me tear up was the realization that I live in a town that cares immensely for an eccentric homeless man. It's also a city where that same homeless man can run for mayor multiple times and still get thousands of votes. Last month marked my one year anniversary of moving to Austin. I moved here with no road map and only what I could fit in my car. The plan was to stay a few months and then see where my ADD took me next. However, whatever energy that made me curious enough to move here has made me stay here. I could tell after my first night in Austin that I was someplace special and I haven't wanted to leave since. Each day this city inspires me more and more and at moments I can honestly say that I'm in love (that could also be because I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time). So in honor of this city that took me in with open arms after fleeing a tumultuous relationship with Los Angeles, I will begin using this blog for part-time Austin "goings-on", part-time hipstercrite musings. not sure who the owner of this picture is, but thanks Everyone ought to have a Lower East Side in their lif e- Irving Berlin The East Side has typically been synonymous with art, culture, history, and grit. When we venture through LES in NYC or Wicker Park in Chicago or Silver Lake in Los Angeles, we feel like we've stepped back into time, that we're not necessarily welcome, and that at any moment something wonderful or terrible might happen. This also goes for Austin's east side. A vibrant and fascinating part of the city, Eastside boasts eclectic eateries, trendy bars, and dozens of notable art galleries all maintaining the feel of a bygone era. Chances are you'll be spending some time over on the Eastside during SXSW and if so, you might want to know where to eat (if you aren't stuffed full of free breakfast tacos supplied at the parties). Here is a list of some of the best East Austin restaurants, cafes, and bars: Best Pizz a: East Side Pies 1401 Rosewood Ave. Many will say that Homeslice on SoCo is the best pizza in Austin, but they're embarrassingly wrong. East Side Pies is hands down the best and most imaginative pizza around. Try their Veggie Nacho pizza topped with spicy black bean sauce, onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and avocados. Or their Blue Moon which is a tomato-less pizza topped with feta, mozzarella, ricotta, goat, romano , and blue cheeses. They also supply delicious salads, blondie brownies, and bottled sodas. The staff is awesomely sassy and the place is a little small and very busy, so make sure you don't dilly-dally. Price: Cheese slice $2.50/Meat or veggie slice $3.00 Best Vegan/Vegetarian: Mr. Natural 1901 E. Cesar Chavez One of two Mr. Natural locations in Austin, this restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of the east side. Both a restaurant and a health food store, Mr. Natural supplies an assortment of food options ranging from a vegan/vegetarian lunch and dinner bar that changes daily to delicious baked goods to cakes to homemade juices. Absolutely worth trying is the Soya Guisada on Fridays and the vegan mint chocolate cupcake. You will never think of veganism the same way again. Price: Lunch buffet $7.99, pastries range from .75-$3.50 Best Mexican : Juan in a Million 2300 E. Cesar Chavez This was a hard category to decide in. I like a lot of Mexican food on the Eastside : Aranda's simplicity, El Chile's creativity, and all the taco trailers in between. I chose Juan in a Million because it's the most famous Mexican food restaurant on the Eastside , having been featured on the Travel Channel's Man vs. Food and Countdown Chowdown . Juan in a Million is most famous for their "Don Juan", a potato, bacon, egg, and cheese scramble that, which I believe, has been cooked on the same griddle for over twenty years. It's also $3.60 and could last you two days! The atmosphere is quaint, but make sure to go at off times. Especially on the weekend, lines can form down the sidewalk! Price: The Don Juan $3.60 Best Sandwich: Bossa Nova 2121 E. 6 th St. Located across the street from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, this Brazilian eatery has some of the best food on the east side. Don't let the fact that it's Brazilian scare you away- their menu is plentiful and delicious while still being unique. My favorite sandwich (when I eat meat) is the Misto Tudo which has turkey, ham, sliced egg, green olives, palm, and mozzarella. Or the Salada de Maca with romaine, apples, cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, and balsamic dressing. Price: Lunch Special- any 1/2 sandwich or pizza slice with a side salad or soup $6.99 Best Coffee : Texas Coffee Trader s 1400 E. 4 th St. Texas Coffee Traders is quite possible my favorite place to visit on the Eastside . Often overlooked due to the fact that it's housed in a warehouse, this place is not to be missed. A Disneyland for the coffee connoisseur, Texas Coffee Trade
s has rows and rows of unique coffee to taste and buy. Typically a place to get your coffee in bulk, the friendly staff will fix you up a cup of cappuccino or tea while you wait. However, this year for SXSW, the store will be setting up a coffee stand on the corner of 4th and Navasota, so make sure to check them out! These guys will remind you of why you love Austin. Most Romantic: Justine's 4710 E. 5 th St. Justine's is relatively new to the Eastside , but a wonderful addition. Situated in an old house, the ambiance of Justine's is quaint and warm. One enters below a vintage neon sign onto a front yard draped with string lights and tables. Inside the dark wood and vaulted ceiling of the house make for a cozy atmosphere. Justine's is a great place to grab a drink or dine in. Inspired by French cuisine, my favorites include the Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade (endives, rouqefort , walnuts, and pear) and the Steak Tartare . Price: Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade $8.50, Steak Tartare $14 Most Metropolitan: East Side Show Room 1100 E. 6 th St. East Side Show Room is also a relatively new to the Eastside . Channeling a 1920's feel, the bar/restaurant showcases vintage furniture and fixtures, local art, and some of the best lighting in town. East Side Show Room is also one of the best places to see and be seen these days. The menu is a little steep, but definitely creative and delicious. Their curried grits and greens is a must, as is their Barbequed Quail and Oranges. Price: Curried Grits &amp; Greens $9, Barbequed Quail &amp; Oranges $18 Most Chill: Rio Rita 1308 E. 6 th St. Rio Rita has quickly become of of my favorite hangout spots on the Eastside . Cafe by day, lounge by night, this funky bar looks like an explosion went off in a vintage furniture store. Rio Rita serves a collection of local food, infused vodkas, and mystery beers. On Monday night you can listen to your own 45 for "Love and a 45" night or bring your crayons and glue for "Arts and Drafts" night on Thursdays. This is definitely a great place to kick back and mingle with the quirkiest of the bunch. Price: Ham &amp; Brie sandwich $6.50, Turkey &amp; Cranberry on a Croissant $6.50 Photo source: Yelp.com Do you have that one dress, one pair of hot pants, or that one hat that always compels people to stop you, grab you arm, and say in a low voice, "Where on Earth did you get that?" Well I just found me a pair of socks that garnered lots of comments at Whole Foods yesterday ('cause you have to look good when you go to Whole Foods). And an awkward run-in with a security guard at Wells Fargo. The security guard was sitting on a bench, and I think she quietly said, "I like your boots" (meaning she liked my awesome kick-ass lace-up slippers) as I walked by. I didn't quite hear what she said, so I turned and gave a slight smile. The sort of smile that says, "I have no idea if you were talking to me or not, but here, here is a half smile to sort of acknowledge what you said". I started obsessing over whether or not she was talking to me and I started to sweat. I wanted to walk up to her and say, "Thank you!", but the time for that had past and I started to rock back and forth in line. When I left the bank and nodded to her, she stared at me stone-faced and I was convinced that she now hated me for giving her a half-ass smile in return for her very sweet compliment. So you wanna know what socks will get you compliments at Whole Foods and awkward Larry David-like situations at banks? The Lacy Lace-up Slipper Socks by Sock Theory . The best part? They're $7. They also come in white. Make sure to check out Sock Theory' s broad collection of unique socks, leg warmers, arm warmers, knee-highs, and panty-hose. Definitely my new favorite online store. Here are few pics of me wearing my new lace-up's. I had to cut my head out because the sun was so bright yesterday, between my squinting and scrunched up mouth while squinting, I looked like what would happen if Renee Zellweger and Sloth procreated. Also, I don't shine my shoes. Obs. First post in my Austin, TX series for SXSW It's that time of year again. The time of year where you stock up on your Adderall or Xanax or Xantac or horse tranquilizers and set your Facebook tagged photos to private. South by Southwest Interactive and Film will be starting this Friday, with the music portion beginning next Wednesday. What does that mean for you? That means your chances of getting drunk with Bill Murrary or hooking up with a hipster from Brooklyn who is in a band with the words "bear", "deer", "neon", "gold", or "black" in it have just improved. If you're new to Austin, here is a list of traits that make our town so unique. Come and join the fun! 1.) The entire city collectively waits with bated breath for the Groupon of the day. 2.) At anytime in anyplace, your chances of hearing New Order playing on the sound system are 2 to 1. 3.) We treat music festivals like national holidays (and we really don't have a choice). 4.) Overhear conversations that start with, (person looking at their Iphone), "Oh, looks like Brooklyn Vegan is following me on Twitter. Cool." (overhear= I said it yesterday). 5.) Facebook comments like, "There is a little kids choir singing Flaming Lips and Wilco at my place of employment right now." 6.) Every single person has a mustache and we have competitions once a month to see who has the best. Photo by Alison Narro 7.) A 24 hour pecan vending machine in the middle of nowhere. 8.) We eat migas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and we can tell you exactly where in town the best migas are located. 9.) The rivers in Austin are made of beer and you can often find us knelt in the river bed, stuffing our goard like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka. 10.) We quietly judge each other on the make of our bicycles and nothing else. 11.) The older and more worn your clothing is, the more street cred you have. 12.) We do a lot of our business out of Airstream trailers. Mostly for aesthetic purposes. The South by Southwest Festival in Austin, TX will be starting this Friday. I plan on devoting most of the week to Austin and SXSW posts. However, I haven't written a single thing yet! In the meantime, please enjoy this gallery of Maurizio Cattelan's work. I learnt of Cattelan this weekend while in Houston. The Menil Collection is currently exhibiting some of his pieces. I'm still brewing what I think about him. What are your thoughts? You have nine followers, and one of them is your mother. You wonder why the hell you're even blogging. You speculate if anyone will ever read your words. You ponder if life is worth living. Well look no further! Listed below are twelve sure-fire ways to drive traffic to your blog and instantly boost your self-worth. 1.) Join Blogging Network Sites - The best blog networking website is Twenty-Something Bloggers. Hands down. Joining 20sb opened up a whole new world for me. Before then, I had no idea how to discover other blogs. 20sb is a supportive and strong community of like-minded bloggers. I can't recommend it enough. Other blogging networks include Blog Lovin ', Blog Her , BlogCatalog , and My Blog Log . 2.) Write Interesting Content - As much as want to go into great detail about your recent trip to the dentist or how you wrapped your Christmas gifts, refrain from it. Truthfully, nobody cares. Unless the dentist had a boner while performing your root canal or you lobbed off your finger while cutting wrapping paper for you gifts...then we might be interested. Humor is a guaranteed way to enter the hearts of millions. Take for example Hyperbole-and-a-Half . You could learn a lot from her. 3.) Write About A Trend Topic - I don't adhere to this rule at all, but it's definitely a way to create buzz on your blog. Commenting on the cultural importance of "Jersey Shore" or how Justin Bieber looks like he should be on the "L Word" is a good way to start a convo. 4.) Befriend Other Bloggers - The blogging community is a tight-knit one. I have met people that I'm convinced sat next to me at the Algonquin Roundtable in another life. These people have encouraged me to grow as a writer and have supported and advertised my work. I wouldn't be where I am today without them and I try to do the same for them. As The Beatles once said, "The love you take is equal to the love you make". 5.) Leave Comments - Bloggers love comments like Mickey Rourke loves ghastly printed button-ups. Our self-esteem begins to slowly hinge on how many comments are left on our blog a day. If you comment on our blog, we will love you forever and most likely return the favor. 6.) Brand Yourself- The general consensus on this seems to be "yucky", but I disagree. The more polished the blog is, the greater the chance a reader will take it more seriously, no? Having a "brand" shows the world that you are legit. Does it take away from the personal aspect of blogging? Sometimes. But this is where you have to get clever in how you brand yourself. Subliminal branding. 7.) Photos! - Photos are a win-win all 'round. Photos grab attention. Photos can often work in substitute of text (Tumblr?). Photos can inspire. I try to put a picture in every single one of my posts, even if it's not necessary. Like a picture of my ass. 8.) Lists - We seem to really like lists. They're easy to read and typically very visual. Remember, the average internet reader's attention span is like 45 seconds (I made that up). It's kind of true though. Think of some of your favorite posts on Buzzfeed or EW.com . Short and sweet lists. 9.) Connect With Your Audience- One of the most talked ideas running through the marketing world these days is Lady Gaga's rise to fame due in part to her fan interaction and loyalty. DoDo like GaGa. Also, the blogs that appear to have the most comments are blogs where the writer shares a part of him/herself with the readers in the post, then interacts with them via the comment box. Personal is good, but don't forget rule #2. 10.) Self Promote, But Only 20% Of The Time - Nobody likes a showoff. However, who is going to know about your blog if you don't say anything? I know some very humble bloggers who haven't even told anyone that they have a blog! You have to walk a fine line here. Tweet or FB that you have a new post up, but don't send personal messages to strangers telling them to check out your blog. Nobody likes that. In fact, we'll purposely not go check out your blog. 11.) Believe That Your Traffic Will Go Up- I know it can get discouraging at times, but don't give up. People want to hear what you have to say. If you believe that your blog will be successful, it most likely will. Power of suggestion. 12.) Post a Picture of Your Ass Keep me posted on your progress! I'm curious to hear.
Next week, I will be leaving my position with Boeing and trek to Boston to work for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Ma. Earlier today I read my very first blog post and how I felt my first week here at Kennedy Space Center has not changed to this day. I will definitely miss everyone I've worked with, the awesome launches , and the space program! However, this does not mean I am giving up on my dream in becoming an astronaut. The blog will continue! :) I still plan on being very active in the community, stay a space advocate, and work towards a PhD. Right now, the direction of our space program is a little up in the air, but I know we'll get back on track. I'm also excited that I found a nearby judo club I am going to join so I can continue the sport. This endeavor will be exciting and I will be supporting the Engineering Analysis group on various projects. Next week is my last week, but I will definitely be blogging during the move process! Thanks to all for the support up to this point. It really means a lot to me!! While attempting to load propellant Friday night, a leak was detected in Discovery's RCS (Reaction Control System) Helium Isolation Value – on the right-hand OMS (Orbital Maneuvering System) fuel system. Further testing and troubleshooting steps are being planned at the launch pad to examine two helium system regulators, which maintain pressure to the fuel tank and are further down the plumbing from the isolation valves. If the regulators are functioning correctly, which will be tested later this week when the necessary equipment is ready, engineers could determine Discovery can safely fly 'as-is' despite the isolation valve problem. If a repair or replacement to the valve is required, we would not be able to access it out at the pad...which means...rolling the shuttle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, demating Discovery from its external fuel tank and solid rocket boosters, then towing Discovery to the Orbiter Processing Facility....AND removing the OMS pod. Even with the planned testing, the April 5 launch date still stands. It's what comes out of these test results that will determine if we need to roll back the shuttle which would cause a delay. SpaceX successfully fired the Falcon 9 rocket's nine Merlin engines for 3.5 seconds, completing a key preflight test before the privately-developed booster is cleared for launch in April. Ground test was one of the final steps before launch of the Falcon 9 , which is scheduled for no earlier than April 12. The static fire verified all of the launch pad's ground systems are ready to support the mission. Between now and launch, engineers will install the rocket's flight termination system charges that would destroy the vehicle if it flew off course and threatened the public. NASA awarded SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to fly 12 operational Falcon 9 and Dragon missions to the International Space Station beginning in 2011. SpaceX plans a flight of the Dragon in July, followed by a rendezvous demonstration with the space station in November. But those schedules hinge on a timely and successful Falcon 9 test flight in April. "IMAX: Hubble 3D" debuts at the Air and Space Museum...we give it the "red carpet" treatment - checking out the movie, checking in with the astronaut stars, listening to the star who voiced it over - Leonardo DiCaprio, and weighing in with the director and the NASA brass about the wow-factor of the IMAX experience. Also: a Falcon 9 "hot fire" disappoints, the shuttle program manager says "no problem" for shuttle to keep flying, and safely -- it's only a question of money -- and Obama gets ready to speak up for his controversial new plan for NASA...and braces for what promises to be a firestorm of protest at planned April 15 conference on the future of America's space program. Discovery is currently at Launch Pad 39A. Launch of STS-131 is targeted for April 5, 2010 at 6:27 a.m. This past week, the STS-131 astronaut crew went through a mock countdown/dress rehearsal to prepare themselves for their actual launch date operations. The external tank that will be used for STS-132 (Shuttle Atlantis - targeted launch on May 14, 2010) arrived last week and was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. You may have heard some talk effecting Endeavour's planned July launch. An issue related to the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 payload testing is threatening a delay to STS-134’s slot in the manifest, to the point it may slip behind STS-133, or even as far as 2011 in a worst case scenario. However, no decision will be made on the schedule until after additional testing results and the launch of STS-131 in April. Read more.. here . The next step in ground testing SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will be a hotfire of the first stage engines. The launch team will ignite the nine Merlin 1C engines for three-and-a-half seconds during the test. Hot fire is targeted for late morning or early afternoon, tomorrow. Lift-off of the rocket could occur late this month, but more likely early April. Florida's Space Coast braces for layoffs, Buzz Aldrin muses on the next steps for NASA and his upcoming stint on "Dancing with the Stars," plus other headlines from This Week In Space. Yesterday I attended the Space Coast's Society of Women Engineers Awards Banquet. I was nominated for the Distinguish New Woman Engineer award. We had guest speaker Dr. Cammy R. Abernathy (Dean, College of Engineering of University of Florida and Professor of Materials Science and Engineering) who gave a great insight about the economic shift in society that has effected the engineering disciplines within universities and industry. I was selected to receive the award in the category I was nominated for. It was a great honor accepting this award last night and being surrounded by so many women who embrace leadership and give back to their community. I have had great support and encouragement from my mentors who have helped shape me professionally throughout my career. One thing I have learned for sure is that you can never have too many mentors. I learn a variety of qualities from the different people I look up to. The ceremony was fantastic and I was amazed in the technical leadership of all the nominees.

I want another baby. I really do. Yassine-not so much.But he may not have to worry-at least not if Martin Kramer has his way. The current fellow at Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs has suggested I -and other Palestinian women from Gaza- should deliberately be stopped from having babies because chances are, they will be grow up to be radicals.According to the Electronic Intifada, who first broke the story last week, Kramer offered this fasinating piece of solicited advice in the annual Herzliyah Conference in Israel earlier this month in which he called on “the West” to take measures to limit the births of Muslim Palestinians of Gaza and consider them a form of terrorism, or, as Kramer puts it, “extreme demographic armament”. He also praised the unconscionable Israeli siege for getting the ball rolling already and reducing the numbers of Palestinian babies there (see: infanticide; Gaza Diet). If your skin didn’t curl watching the audience clap at the end of that video, well, save your soul somehow.Family Planning, the Martin Kramer way Kramer’s argument: Gaza is a cauldron of crazy;
You may have heard the announcement yesterday, via WWD , that Madonna and Dolce &amp; Gabbana , after a very successful pairing for their 2010 advertising campaign , have collaborated on a new line of eyewear called MDG, featuring six designs (shown above). Three of the six styles are shown below (images courtesy of Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Swide magazine ) The 6 pairs of glasses will be distributed by Luxottica and feature an MDG logo on the temple. The "M" of the MDG symbol is filled with little stars, very Madonna. The chic shades will be in D&amp;G stores in May. They will retail from 180 to 210 euros or around $250 to $290. Floating around the net have been some screen stills (shown below) of the upcoming campaign for the new eyewear shot by Steven Klein , who has long worked with Madonna for D&amp;G as well as other projects.

I can't seem to get enough of the very talented Diem Chau 's unusual work. While her porcelain work is amazing, it's her carved crayola crayons that continue to blow me away. I have blogged about her carved crayons in the past , but recently she tackled the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac which are now on exhibit at the Packer Schopf Gallery in Chicago along with many of her ceramic works in a show named Sojourn. First, the 12 symbols of the Chinese Zodiac: Now, Diem Chau's Zodiac Crayons: She began with the monkey on the far right (note how she wrote on the crayons which was to become which animal): and once they were finished, she mounted each carved crayon on a wood pedestal for exhibition: above: all twelve Chinese Zodiac crayons, finished and mounted.

Take a look. above background photo by yang yi Below is the article by Conor Risch for PDN, followed by images from each of the 30 photographers and links to their personal sites. Look at the photographers in this year’s PDN’s 30 class and you’ll find a solid refutation of the idea that “everyone is a photographer now.” Did “everyone” move to Beijing to freelance for the AP with no financial guarantee like Danfung Dennis? Or live out of a mini-van so they could create a major project like Scott Conarroe? Or defy social norms to become one of the only female photojournalists from Gaza like Eman Mohammed? Is “everyone” willing to be as patient as Alex Prager, who put on her own shows when gallerists ignored her? Does “everyone” have 2,250 followers on Flickr like Ben Roberts? Perseverance and determination are common to all these photographers but equally notable is the individuality of their interests and styles. These photographers have produced long-term projects on music scenes (Lauren Dukoff), orthodox Hasidic communities (Clémence De Limburg), and a mother’s paranoid schizophrenia (Sohrab Hura). They have used the visual language of gritty reportage to shoot cookbooks (Gabriel Stabile) and created photojournalism based on “a sense of feeling” (Andy Spyra). They have used modern image-making techniques to lament the destruction of a centuries-old city (Yang Yi). They tell stories that matter to them in ways that make them matter to viewers. Yes, it’s true: a lot more people are taking pictures now than when PDN was founded 30 years ago. But only a very small percentage of those people are photographers. We salute these 30 individuals, who are helping to define what being a photographer means today. —Conor Risch Click on each artist's name below (shown in alphabetical order) to visit their website or portfolio. levi brown: alejandro cartagena: scott conarroe: sumit dayal: clemence de limburg: gratiane de moustier: danfung dennis: lauren dukoff: matt eich: matthieu gafsou: marcelo gomes: deborah hamon: estelle hanania: ben hoffmann: sohrab hura: wayne lawrence: brent lewin: eman mohammed: adrian mueller: nick onken: alex prager: thomas prior: ben roberts: anna skladmann: andy sprya: gabriele stabile: peter van agtmael: elizabeth weinberg: yang yi: reed young: You can view more pieces from each of these 30 photographers at PDN's online gallery here.

I'm talking about truly creating your own chocolate bars from scratch. above: three examples of possible options for your own created chocolate bars chocri is a German startup, founded in September 2008, but launched in the US in January 2010. What they do is we allow you to customize your own chocolate bar right on their website. You start with an organic Belgian chocolate base of milk, white or dark chocolate and then choose from a selection of over 100 of gourmet, organic and exotic ingredients (fruit, grains, nuts, spices, confections and decor). If you don't know anything about ingredients, they also offer many recommended combinations and options to make the selection simple. Once you've chosen or built your bar, you can name it (they print the name and the ingredients on the package), and then they hand-make the bars in Germany and ship them off to you. From bacon to blueberries, pretzels to pecans, you can be as adventurous or as safe as you'd like. I made three to test them out (shown below). One was dark chocolate with real orange bits and orange chocolate drops, another was milk chocolate, pecans and toffee and the third was milk chocolate with organic salted pretzels and caramel chocolate drops. And yes, they are, er.... were, delicious. So, how do you do it? You start with your choice of milk, white or dark chocolate as the base: Then you are walked through the process to choose as many or as few additives as you wish from the following options (click on each image below to enlarge): Choose your fruit: Your spices: Your nuts: Your confections: Your decor: Your grains: There's no minimum. You can choose to make one bar or one hundred bars. Once you've selected your ingredients for your chocolate bar(s), they print the name you choose and the ingredients on the individual package, then ship them right to your door. They use only the best ingredients, such as organic, fair trade chocolate from Belgium. Making them even more delicious is the fact that they also donate a percentage of otheir revenues to DIV Kinder, an organization that supports children at the Ivory Coast, and you are free to add your own donation at checkout. above: the Chocri team What are you waiting for? With Easter and Mother's Day right around the corner, these would make awesome gifts. Get started here. If you like chocolate, you'll love this: The Art of Chocolate. Oops, Reverse That. http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss Conde Nast UK's LOVE magazine is a bi-annually fashion forward publication that launched in February 2009. Filled with edgy and artful photography by such well-known photographers as Terry Richardson, Mario Testino, Josh Olins, David Sims, Sølve Sundsbø, Juergen Teller, Angelo Pannetta and of course, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the magazine is light on editorial and heavy on nude models. For their third issue, they featured 8 different covers of nude supermodels Lara Stone, Jeneil Williams, Amber Valletta, Naomi Campbell, Kristen McMenemy, Daria Werbowry, Natalia Vodianova and Kate Moss with strategically placed censor bars. The magazine also includes editorial shots of the same models baring all. above: Kristen McMenamy from the interior editorial in the magazine Shot by talented and respected fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott , and styled by Katie Grand, the magazine's 3rd issue and its 8 covers were very hyped. The Gap (UK) even proposed a limited edition Tee of each of the 8 covers: The T-shirts went on sale now at Dover Street Market in London and Colette in Paris, priced £30 and quickly sold out. All profits from the GAP LOVE tee shirts went to support Haiti. The one exception was Kate Moss' tee, whose profits went to Great Ormond Street, a UK children's charity. All 8 covers are shown below, along with a few of the very risqué, but stunning editorial shots. As artful as they are, this makes this post inappropriate for those under 18. Please view with discretion. above: the first projected cover with Lara Stone, and the original photo, prior to deciding to put the censor bars over the naughty bits. The covers were then published as below: Lara Stone Jeneil Williams Daria Werbowy Kristen McMenamy Amber Valletta Kate Moss Naomi Campbell Natalia Vodianova The images of the same models, inside, however are not censored and here are a few of those photos for you. Lara Stone: Naomi Campbell: Kate Moss: There are more very sexy, very naked models within. And yes, you can see all of those here at Huffington post.

My first reaction was "eeeeuuuuwww", then "hmmmmm", followed by "naaaah." But others may claw their way to this new social networking site that capitalizes on the growing trend of older women dating (seducing?) younger men. The brains behind the concept, Shelli Netko, the founder and president of Cougars &amp; Co. says: "My main goal in starting Cougars &amp; Co. was to create an environment where women could learn to love the life they live and live the life the love. After all, age is just a number. Recent surveys show 34% of women in their 40s date men who are younger and 17% of women in their 50s do the same. This isn't just a trend, it's a new social norm that both women and men are obviously embracing. Women are gravitating to younger men because they seem to have more of an energetic spirit that matches theirs. Women are taking better care of themselves, as a result, 40 is the new 30; 50 is the new 40. So the age difference becomes a non-issue.

A retrospective of fashion legend Yves Saint Laurent opened yesterday at the Petit Palais in Paris, only two years after his death in 2008. The impressive retrospective covers 15 chapters of his career, its critical acclaim and occasional failures, including his 1971 forties-inspired "scandal collection", which was pummeled by critics at the time. above photos © Fondation Pierre Bergé - Yves Saint Laurent The exhibit begins with his early work for Christian Dior and continues through to his last final collection, in 2002. In total, there are 307 pieces of couture and ready-to-wear fashions accompanied by films, artwork and photos. above: Yves Saint Laurent in his Dior studio above: Yves Saint Laurent in his own studio, 1986 Designs for Catherine Deneuve in the 1967 movie Belle de Jour , Lauren Bacall, and the Duchess Of Windsor are included as well as creations that were inspired by art, far away places (he is said to have used his imagination and preferred that to travel) and the glamour of Hollywood. Okay, so it's not as impressive as the actual show, but here's a little retrospective I put together for you (in case you can't get to the Petit Palais) of many of the key pieces from his numerous and varied collections, in chronological order, along with some art and photos from the exhibit: 1958 (for Dior): 1958 and 1960 (for Dior): 1960 and 1962 : 1965 (the famous Mondrian dress and a tribal inspired Raffia dress) : 1966 (lower left was for the YSL Rive Gauche Collection): 1967 (for Catherine Deneuve in Belle De Jour , for which he designed all her outfits): Miss Deneuve with the designer: 1967 and 1968 : 1968 and 1969 (for the Duchess of Windsor): 1969 and 1970 : 1971 ( aka "the Scandal Collection"): 1971 (for Jane Birkin ) and 1973 (for Lauren Bacall ) 1976 : 1977 and 1986 : 1981 and 1982 : 1990 : 1992 and 1997 : 2001 : 2002 (his final collection): all fashion photos © Alexandre Guirkinger YSL sketches for his spring couture 1988 collection: His Love series of artwork, which he began in 1970 : 1977: 1985: above images of fashions and art from yslretrospective.com An IIHIH tangent: Prunier Caviar has used YSL artwork on their special collection of LOVE caviar tins for many years.

For those of you joining us for the first time, please go back and start reading from the beginning (back in August 2005). Otherwise, the blog may not make much sense to you. 2009 UPDATE: This blog authors are using the assistance of LANDOLT &amp; ASSOCIATES in Fort Worth, Texas, for advice on this blog. Please contact them if you have any questions or inquiries: contact@landoltlawoffice.com Hi, this is Traci, the Blog Administrator... The twins are trying to decide what should be posted here and what shouldn't. I apologize for the delay. I was reading back over the posts and some of the emails, and some of them are really interesting about twins switching places. I thought maybe we could open up a discussion about that while we wait... If you are a twin or know a twin who has switched places, please email your stories to me. We'll try to put together a posting with everyone's comments, so be sure to indicate if it's okay to post it on the blog. You are also welcome to send in your impression of identical twins overall...and how this blog has or hasn't changed your view of twins. And, of course, if you do send in your comment or email, we will send you a totally imaginary Twinkie Experiment T-shirt! Thanks to all you loyal Twinkie Fans out there! Time to go buy a box and eat some while we're waiting. Traci Email inquiries: contact@landoltlawoffice.com Happy New Year, Ya'll!! While Ashley has been portraying me down here at the coast, I was up north living in her condo. Yes, while she was on the beach and enjoying the ocean, I was "enjoying" the lovely white fluffy stuff. I took this picture of the view behind Ashley's condo. Talk about a contrast to the view outside my house! Sorry about the delay in the blog posts. Ashley and I have been having "creative differences" about this blog. To make a long story short, Ashley read my comment about her and Tarkington and said: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD THEM THAT! The way I see it, Professor Tarkington is MY professor. MINE. What happens at the law school is my business because these people think that was ME doing all that stuff. So why can't I talk about it? Ashley really loves all of you out there and appreciates your support. I understand that, and I think that's great. But, it doesn't mean that you should have the details glossed over or sugar-coated. I'll try to give you hints about Tarkington when I can--until I can figure out a way to give you the whole story... How embarrassing that Ashley and I are having a fight on the world's stage. This has to be my mom's worst nightmare... Back to what happened to me... As one of the Commentors pointed out (and made me laugh), the Twinkie Experiment wasn't exactly fair--at least at the beginning, because Ashley got a nude beach, and what did I get? Altitude sickness! Overall, I have to admit, I probably did have an easier time with the whole school thing. Dr. Lyle was in on the Twin Switch, so I didn't have to go into an academic program alone. I can't imagine for my life walking into a law school program like Ashley did. I feel bad about laughing, but I can't help it. She probably was able to do it because she has this mentality that she can handle anything. I don't think she knows even now what a lion's den she was walking into. I had the opposite problem. Instead of walking into a room full of law students who practically pee around the room to mark their territory, I had the "huggers." You know who I'm talking about. Those people who have to hug you like they haven't seen you in years, and you are a long-lost dear friend. I'm not a big touchy-feely type person, unless it's a really hot guy who's doing the touching and feeling (haha). It's probably inherent to the whole psychology thing to have them be so tactile. Probably something Freudian. As I mentioned in an earlier post, the party Dr. Lyle had at the start of the semester was especially humorous because Ashley didn't give me a physical description of Robert. (She told me she didn't think I'd run into him.) So the problem ended up being: How do you stay away from someone when you don't know what they look like? One of these days, I'm going to ask Robert if I actually spoke to him at the party before I knew who he was... Have I mentioned that Dr. Lyle's husband is hot? He is. Totally. Of course, he's a little old and MARRIED, but I thought he was really nice looking in a Kevin Costner kind of way. (Man, I might as well delete this paragraph now, because I'm sure Ashley will have a fit that I said that!) He was also really sweet and funny. He walked around helping the caterers and stuff at the party, and every time he'd see me, he'd say, "So, are you caught yet?" Dr. Lyle's husband is a psychologist, too. Can you imagine what their kids must be like???? The first day of school was pretty anxiety-driven. The lack of humidity in the air made my hair have more body ---something I'm definitely not used to since I've been living at the beach. We're talking flat-head city. I have a flippy haircut that is (I think) darling, and the multi-layers and flips make it look not so flat in the humidity. But when you take me from a place with 95 percent humidity and drop me into a place with 18 percent humidity, well, you can imagine what happened. The flippiness with a small "f" turned into flippiness with a big fat "F". And Ashley is not a flippy kind of person. She warned me the people up north may not take kindly to a flippy haircut on her. I tried to get rid of it. Believe me, I tried. I used water on it after it was dry. I used hair spray. I curled it under.... But when I arrived on that huge campus and walked through the wind up hill (both ways), the hair took on a life of its own. And it decided to be flippy. And I think I told you last time, that when I ran into Paige, Ashley's best friend (who I've met a few times when I've visited Ashley in the past) the very first thing out of her mouth was WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH YOUR HAIR??? Not "Hi, how are you," or "how was your summer", but a rude announcement that might as well have said, "Hey! Everyone! Look over here at this ugly hair!" It's no secret that I am not a big fan of Paige. As this blog goes on, I think you'll understand why. The hair thing started it, though. So much for integrating quietly into the crowd. Everyone had to notice me and my hair. Which only brought on more hugging, since that's what psych students do. What a big difference class was compared to law school. The psych seminar actually had donuts and coffee for the students! And the first day was spent going around the room introducing ourselves. Students actually talked amongst themselves WHILE Dr. Lyle was talking. And she didn't kill them. Not to mention how nice everyone was to each other. We also didn't have to read for the first day, which was weird. Some people didn't even have their textbooks yet. I was in shock. The most fun on the first day was finally seeing who the notorious Robert was. He wasn't anything like I had imagined him from Ashley's comments. And I don't remember seeing him at Dr. Lyle's party. He's tall -- almost 6 feet, slim, but not skinny or fat. Dresses pretty nice. Dark hair and dark warm eyes with wire-rim glasses. I usually don't like guys with glasses, but he was an exception. Okay, I admit it, I thought Robert was cute from the very first day. But it's not like I hit on him or anything. I intended to keep my distance and not even speak to him. He sat in the row in front of us, and Paige leaned over to me and said, "I guess he wants to make sure you've seen him." And in typical Paige-fashion, she said it loudly enough for him to hear. The girl sitting on the other side of me, who I called "The Screamer" for awhile since I didn't know her name, of course had to say hi to Robert. She was like leaning forward with her desk (they are the individual desks, not like the rows of tables in law school), in front of me to ask Robert how his summer was. When he turned around, he just kind of looked at me for a second and then said, "Fine." Real big conversationalist. The first day of class left me with one major question: WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO PSYCHOLOGY?? I took a few courses in college, and I've read stuff through the years. But somehow, they changed it. It's no longer the common sense intuitive, get in touch with your inner-child's feelings, bring memories to the surface, bells ringing, dogs salivating, penis envying, human behavior study that I thought it was. Dr. Lyle gave an overview lecture about the topics we would be covering in the course, and I was really amazed. It's now a complicated mixture of theories, statistics, philosophies, medicine, and science. I guess it was pretty arrogant of me to walk in there thinking I was up to par with the other students. Boy, did I learn that lesson the hard way... Here's a picture of what Christmas time looks like on the coast. Ashley took this picture from the upper deck of the Ferry on her way back home from law school on her last day as "Amy." This is Traci, the blog administrator, and I have a message for you from the whole gang. Apparently, almost everyone (except the professors?) knows about this blog now. ( Talk about pressure...;)) We Wish You,Your Family, and Friends...A Very Merry Christmas &amp; Happy New Year!! from Ashley &amp; Amy Traci Drs. Miriam and William Lyle Joyce (Mom) Martin (Dad) Robert Peevy Paige Fowler Charlie and his flock: Rose Ricky Haylie Giny Billy Emma Lee Duane Libby Sammy Regan &amp; Booger Welcome to the Real-Life Twinkie Experiment Part Two! I'm Amy Morrighan, and my twin sister's name is Ashley--who most of you already know. Just a brief background in case you are just joining us... Ashley and I are twenty-seven year old identical twins. Ashley is in her third year of graduate school, working towards her Doctorate in Psychology. Her emphasis is on Twin Studies at the University of ______. (I still can't put the name of her school.) She lives up North where it snows more than I would like, but otherwise it's beautiful. Ashley's best friend is named Paige. Ashley used to like a guy named Robert until the great AC/DC Concert Incident last summer. Robert and Paige are also psych doctoral students. Although Paige is more into Abnorrmal Psychology...which is understandable if you've ever met her. Sorry, that was petty. Bad Amy, bad. While Ashley is in grad school, I am in my second year (a "2L") in law school. I can't give my exact location, but I can tell you I live on the coast. My interest in law has primarily been in the area of Intellectual Property. But I also am interested in other areas which span across the board. They say the first year of law school is the worst, and mine was no exception. In fact, I can honestly say, last year was the worst year I've ever had. The coursework itself is challenging, but not as hard as they make it out to be. It wasn't the work itself I found challenging since I actually like studying the law. The people in my life you've probably heard the most about are my professors for this past semester who Ashley encountered: Professor Rogerson, Professor Tarkington, and Professor Mathews. My two closest friends (or at least they were up until the Twin Switch) are Vicki and Beth. I am probably closest to my next-door neighbor, Charlie, who has taken in a whole lot of his kids and grandkids to live with him. He basically has a big ol' heart and loves to feed and take care of people. And dogs. He has a beach house right next to mine, and actually owns mine too, though he rents it out to me. Ashley and I are the only kids in our family. Our parents live in (can I say where they live? No? Okay.) They live in a place that's cold, too. We have great parents who support us financially (and emotionally) while we are in school. Neither of our parents were supposed to know about the Twin Switch, but that changed when Ashley told Mom. More details about that later. We ultimately decided to do the Twin Switch for several reasons... 1. Everyone always asks us if we ever switch places, and we wanted to see if we could pull it off now that we're adults. 2. Ashley is working on her dissertation involving twins, and she wanted to see if her advisor would let her incorporate the data from the switch somehow. Her advisor, Dr. Lyle, said she would review Ashley's and my data at the end of the switch to see if there was anything workable for the dissertation. I am sure Ashley will give you the scoop on that. 3. As mentioned above, I had a hard time with law school, and was about to give up on it, and I wanted to see if there was anything Ashley could do while she was there as me. Of course, I didn't -exactly- tell Ashley how bad things were or how much I was relying on her for help... But that's because I didn't know how things would be for her. And she told me over and over not to say anything that would alter her behavior during the twin switch. Ashley and I also started off trying to think of a bet... I would bet we could pull off the switch (because I always knew we could), and Ashley would bet we couldn't. Unfortunately, we couldn't ever agree on what we would put for the wager. Looking back on it, I guess we could have used Robert...(Just kidding) The whole thing seemed pretty funny at first, and we both had our doubts as to if we would actually even give it a try. Then Ashley flew down to visit me, and we started getting our hair and nails done to match each other. I thought Ashley was going to catch the first flight out when I gave her a tour of the law school, showed her where everything was, where to sit, etc. I think that's when reality set in for her. I had no idea how freaked out she was until after the switch was over and she admitted what she did the weekend right before school started... Ashley told me I shouldn't mention anything about it, but I'll see if I can put the details in. Let's just say, Ashley didn't tell you EVERYTHING she did during the switch. I think many of you would be surprised and amused if you heard it all. As for me, you haven't heard everything that I went through, either. Ash and I have agreed to keep this Rated G or PG since we have no idea how old our readers are. Sorry, that means no graphic details about what went on between Ashley and Professor Tarkington (Can I mention that, Ashley? No? Okay.) You didn't hear that from me... I left for Ashley's condo up North on the weekend right before school started. Leaving the ocean was a lot harder than I thought it would be. I really felt a loss for some reason, and it wasn't until much later that I figured out why (with Robert's and Ashley's help). It felt like I was leaving my swingset or something. When we were little, Ashley and I had the coolest swingset in our back yard, with the monkeybars along the top, with a swing, the rings, glider, etc. It was awesome. Then, my dad took a job in another state, and we had to move. Without the swingset. Ash and I were mortified and actually grieved for our swingset. Anyway, that's the same grief I felt when I left the coast, and it was haunting for me. I couldn't understand it because I figured the Twin Switch wouldn't last THAT long, and I could go back anytime I wanted thanks to frequent flier miles. When the switch ended, and Ashley and I were able to sit down and go over everything, it was then Ashley told me what she had discovered regarding identity issues for twins during our twin switch. It feels like you are leaving yourself behind when you switch places with your twin. Anything that is not exactly like your twin, you have to cut off. Completely. Otherwise people who knew Ashley would never believe I was her. It's not just leaving my "life" that was hard... It was leaving ME...all the things about me that I like (fish, crabs, etc), and having to mentally train myself to like what Ashley likes or Ashley does. Mentally, it has more of an effect on you that you might think. I could never have anticipated how much it would effect me. So, I arrive up north, and (I hope I can tell you this part) I had Altitude Sickness for awhile because her condo is near the mountains. Going from sea-level to the mountains took some getting used to. I had migraine-like headaches for awhile. Other than that, escaping the 98 degree temperatures and 95% humidity was fabulous!
 My hair just seemed to come alive for some reason. This, of course, meant I had to deal with the flippiness of my haircut. I have a medium length shorter-cut which is cut to flip in the back. Ashley said "no way" would Paige or anyone believe she would ever have a flippy cut. It was a constant battle between me and my hair there for awhile. And on my first day of class, the first words out of Paige's mouth when she saw me was: "WHAT IS UP WITH YOUR HAIR?" I met with Dr. Lyle the Saturday before school started. Ashley thinks this woman is so great, but to be honest, she didn't make that great of a first impression on me. She came across very "snooty" almost--not very friendly to me at all. Ash says it's because she's from the North and "that's how some Northerners are," but I don't buy it. Everyone else was really nice. I also think Dr. Lyle had her own agenda with the twin switch. There were times when I definitely thought she purposely set me up to fail so she could see if anyone could tell I wasn't really Ashley. Dr. Lyle had a student reception at her house that night, which gave me a chance to be around the Psych people before classes started. Of course, Ashley didn't describe Robert for me, so I didn't know what he looked like. She told me just to ignore him anyway, since I was supposed to be her. Ashley was mad at Robert because he never called her after their one date they had (that ended in disaster). So the plan was for me to just stay away from him. I don't think Ashley realized that Robert was signed up to be in the same seminar as I was. It was just a matter of time before I ran into him. At Dr. Lyle's party, however, I tried to avoid him. But how do you avoid someone when you don't know what that person looks like??? There was a girl at the party named Jamie who walked over to me first thing and wanted to know how my "date with Robert" went. I told her I didn't want to talk about it, and she said, "Oh, that's because he's HERE, isn't he?" I almost freaked out right then because for all I knew, I had already been talking to him and been sickly-sweet and nice, like I was trying to be to everyone I encountered. Later during the party, Jamie came up to me again to let me know she saw Robert in the livingroom. I tried to sneak a peek at the guys in the livingroom to see if I could guess which guy my sister would like. I didn't have Robert pegged right, though. I still can't remember if I actually talked to him or not before I knew who he was. If I did, I'm sure he thought it was weird, because on Monday, when I really did find out who he was, I intentionally stayed away from him. Well, I wanted to give ya'll some background on me and to kind of let you know where things started. This has been just some general comments, and next I'll try to get into the details more. Hi Everybody~! I took this picture right out in front of Charlie's and Amy's beach houses. It's my favorite time of day--sunset. I apologize for not posting sooner. Things have been pretty hectic, as you can probably imagine. Thanks to everyone for your kind emails to Traci that she forwarded to me. It has meant a great deal. As I think Traci posted already, Amy would like to have a chance to give her side of the "story." She read my blog postings, which is okay, since I was trying to get her to switch back and told her where the site was so she could know what's been going on in her life. She isn't actually mad or anything; she just wants people to see how things were for her before they judge her. I told her no one is judging anybody. Life is life, and we're all human. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone, so to speak. I hope you all will enjoy Amy's side of things. She was going to post her own blog all along, but she wasn't sure who she could trust to get things out there without getting caught. We had some close calls, and given her background at the law school, she had to be extra extra careful. She did keep a journal though with entries, so she can make postings rather than throw it all out there all at once. I'm not sure what format she is going to use, though. I think it also depends on Traci. I suspect it will be a little at a time. I told Amy she should try and publish the information in a book somehow since the information is already writen, instead of re-writing it as a blog. Plus, there are some details both of us experienced that we didn't (and still don't) feel comfortable putting on the computer (I think you guys might like to hear some of that stuff as well--cough, cough). So this will give Amy a chance to give you a preview of what a book might say--only the Rated G (PG?) blog version. I know from my experience that it's really easy to form opinions about someone by watching someone else living their life. So, all I ask is that you not be too hard on me (or her) as you hear what Amy has been up to in my life. :o) Thanks again for your friendship and support during the past months. God Bless you, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, Ashley Morrighan Hi, this is Traci again. I know everyone is waiting to hear what happened with the Twin Swtich -- I have been waiting too, very impatiently. I finally heard from Ashley, and thankfully she and Amy have patched things up. Or, at least they are speaking to one another. Amy apparently discovered and read over this blog and was pretty ticked off... which I think we can all understand. She is now demanding equal time to give her side of what happened. And she wants it before Ashley tells everyone how things ended up with the Robert situation and the Twin Swtich. Ashley asked me this morning if I would mind posting some blog entries from Amy. I don't mind doing it, but I wanted to run it by our audience out there first. I've gotten numerous emails from people over the past 4 or 5 months begging me for information about Amy. It looks like you'll finally find out what happened. Just let me know if it is something you're still interested in. Please just post your opinion on the "Comments." And I guess we'll take it from there. Thanks, Traci Campbell, Blog Administrator Hi, This is Traci, the Blog Administrator. Ashley asked me to post this message for her. We apologize for the silence on the blog lately (part of it was my fault because I went out of town for two weeks). Ashley is still trying to get things straightened out with Amy. Amy still is trying to tell Robert SHE is Ashley, and neither Amy nor Robert will talk to Ashley, Ashley's mom, or dad. Law school for the semester is winding down. Ashley, even though she's ticked off at Amy, doesn't want Amy to lose her legal education and chance at becoming a lawyer. So, she tried to drop the classes for the semester--saying she needed a leave of absence for family reasons. The dean said no (he sounds like a MAJOR jerk to me) about Business Associations and Criminal Procedure, since those classes are required. She can, and did, drop the Intellectual Property class. She also quit being Tarkington's Research Assistant "due to family reasons" that are taking up her time. Tarkington apparently was more understanding than the dean... Which is good, considering Ashley doesn't know squat about legal writing. So where everything stands right now... Ashley has no choice but to try and take the final exams for Business Associations and Criminal Procedure. We all know it's a long shot...Talk about pressure! Richard, the guy who worked in the Law Clinic, is helping her study, by the way. Whether or not Ashley can pass the exams...I guess we'll have to wait and see. But that is where she is and what is going on right now. I'm sure you'll hear from Ashley once the exams are over. Keep your fingers crossed for her... Traci Campbell Things have been kind of hectic, and I apologize to everyone for not posting sooner! Here's the basic scoop on what's been going on... 1. Rogerson seems to have backed off for right now... Our Operation HERB actually seems to have worked! Yea!! 2. Amy and Robert have apparently gotten serious. Like way serious. Boooo! 3. Exams at the law school start in just a few WEEKS from now... Major Booooo! 4. And, here's the biggest thing of all...AMY IS REFUSING TO SWITCH BACK! Monsterous Booooo! Amy says she's worried about what Robert is going to say if she tells him we switched places, so she's continuing to let him think she's ME. I tried to call her, and she won't talk to me about it. I've sent emails, and she won't respond. I've been frazzled about this situation, because at first, I thought Amy was joking. How can she not come back here? I thought the snow and cold would have sent her back here faster than anything, but I guess Robert is keeping her warm...? I also am having a cow about Amy abandoning her law school. I understand that things were bad with Rogerson--believe me, I understand! But this is ridiculous. We need to come up with a plan, and the plan can't involve the idea of ME taking her exams. No matter what she says, I can't think of a worse nightmare than Law Exams.... I'm flying up tonight to visit my parents for Thanksgiving. The only thing I can think to do is explain everything to my parents and see if they can talk some sense into Amy. No, Amy won't be there. She's having Thanksgiving with Robert's family...

Whether it was when I was growing up or with my own family, we have always had a dog. A dog  was an integral part of my life, until now. I am dogless. And I miss it.In my growing up family, we had a dog named Spot. Original, yes? Spot was a mutt but she was attractive enough to get a thoroughbred Boston Bull Terrier as her mate and had thirteen little ones that looked just like him. But what I remember most was my mom feeding that dog like you wouldn't believe. I can still see her filling up her dish with everything she could find, piled high and mumbling in Swedish under her breath about the poor thing having to feed all those pups. Didn't buy dog food in those days. At least, we didn't. (Remember this was during or just after the depression.) Just table scraps tho I saw Mom give her lots of her homemade bread to fill her up with leftover gravy over all.I kept one of the pups and called him Pepper. He died of distemper. You see, we didn't have all the shots and stuff like that in those days either. I wrote what I think was my first poem in my grief over his death.In almost 60 years of marriage, we've had numerous dogs. I remember Flicka, a sort of black golden retriever looking dog who was a renegade and always running away from home. I would be teaching school at St. Edward's Catholic School about two blocks from our house and I would see Flicka running by. I was in my midlife years then--famous for running to the window and opening them to pant and the kids would all yell,
First Japan , now Paris. IKEA have kitted out four Parisian subway stations with their sofas and lamps for two weeks. The main point of the publicity is to demonstrate the quality and strength of IKEA products through the ‘ bum test ’ of thousands of Parisians. There's more behind the campaign at the PSFK blog If you're going through St. Lazare, Champs-Elysées Clémenceau, Concorde, and Opéra Metro stations, you'll have a comfortable rest on the platforms. Just hope that the Parisian homeless don't catch on to this too quickly, as IKEA may find they'll also be testing whether their sofas are stain resistant. There's a great set of pictures on Flickr by Les Favoris where you can see commuters spending more time looking at the sofas rather than actually sitting on them. Thanks to FreshPlastic for finding the IKEA links. After IKEA in Kobe, Japan put their furniture in train carriages (see above), we just need IKEA in the UK to get in on the act. It would make that wait for your delayed London Underground train, much more bearable. It's only one step on from the current round of Homebase TV ads where a station in Carlisle is decorated! Come on IKEA, London awaits. London Underground's former managing Director has had preliminary discussions with Tube Lines about possibly becoming the contractor's chief exec. This could be interesting as O'Toole strongly criticised Tube Lines while he was in office. Perhaps it needs someone like him to help the current acrimonious disputes between LU & Tube Lines . Tube Lines hasn't had a permanent chief executive since February 12, when Dean Finch resigned & became chief executive of National Express. Tube Lines, which works on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, has been the sole surviving contractor since July 2007 when Metronet went into administration. Tim O'Toole left the London Underground in April last year and returned to Philadelphia to spend more time with his family. David Begg, Tube Lines' chairman, says he had the highest regard for Tim O'Toole's reputation. But added: " I haven't offered Tim O'Toole a contract, so I cannot say whether or not Tim O'Toole is coming ." However according to the Evening Standard a Tube Lines spokeswoman said: " I can confirm that we are in contractual negotiations with Tim O'Toole over the chief executive's job. We are hoping to conclude these discussions soon ." The FT said that Boris Johnson declined to comment, although they believe that Tim O'Toole has also held discussions with him. A number of people were lucky enough to bag tickets to a walking tour of the world's first tunnel under a navigable river. Victorians last walked through the tunnel in 1865 & now, 145 years later it was opened to the public for two days. The tickets sold out incredibly quickly, but luckily for us a number of people have blogged & very kindly shared photography. Matthew Knight aka webponce has an amazing set of pictures from the Thames Tunnel Tour . I love the detail of the original brickwork on the archways below. He said " I've always wanted to walk down a Tube line, and to be able to walk along the Marc Brunel Thames Tunnel was even more special - as the world's first underwater tunnel. Much of the original tunnel is still visible at the Rotherhithe end. It is amazing to think there were stalls and shops down here. Thanks to the guides who showed us around. The Thames Tunnel is an underwater tunnel, built beneath the River Thames in London, United Kingdom connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping. It measures 35 feet (11 m) wide by 20 feet (6 m) high and is 1,300 feet (396 m) long, running at a depth of 75 feet (23 m) below the river's surface (measured at high tide) ." Peter Watts was also on the tour this morning " along with every other transport nerd ". He said: " the tunnel reopened as a foot tunnel for what we were assured will be the very last time in its history, which is just the sort of hyperbole I like to hear on a Friday morning.... The tunnel is now pretty much indistinguishable from any other underground line. The only sense you get that you are heading under the river is that it is rather damp and chilly. Although most of the tunnel’s original brickwork has been concreted over, there are some areas where you can still the original bricks, beautiful but damaged. " Darryl Chamberlain from 853 blog also went along and said " The brickwork had concrete applied to it in the 1990s to protect the tunnel – said to be the leakiest on the Underground network – but after a row broke out between London Transport and preservation agencies, a small part close to Rotherhithe station was left alone. Rather than a reminder of how the tunnel was, the existence of the exposed bri just seems to justify the decision to cover it in concrete in the first place ." Peter continued: " Arches bisect the tunnel throughout its length. These were originally used as small shops, as the tunnel became the world’s first underwater shopping arcade. These spaces are tiny, and would have been cramped, dark, cold and damps places to work from. I imagine they are rather like those booth-cum-shops you get along Brixton’s Atlantic Road, where people flog phonecards and reggae from the stairwells of blocks of flats. Here, though, you can get a sense of the detailing that distinguishes so much Victorian architecture . Peter's visited a number of other subterranean parts of London (deep-level Tube shelter at Chancery Lane) & you can learn about what got him initially hooked at the rest of his great blog post . Thanks to both him, Darryl Chamberlain & Matthew for sharing the experience & photos. If you managed to bag a ticket, it would be great to hear what you thought too. Remember the days when you could smile smugly in a pub quiz to answer " What's unique about St John's Wood London Underground station? " It's the only Tube station that doesn't share any letters with the word mackerel. A couple of week's ago, you might remember I asked what was unique about Pimlico Tube . Only one person worked out that it was the only station that didn't share any letters with the word badger! Now some clever person, Ben Green, has built a great time wasting tool " Badgers in Pimlico " so you can type in words and see which stations do not contain its letters. Amazingly there's only one station that doesn't have any letters of the word "Underground" in it (thanks to @qwghlm for that) and that Debden is unique in at least two ways (thanks to Paul Clarke & Richard George for that). Have minutes of fun seeing which other Tube stations are unique . Thanks to Fimb for the initial heads up on this! In a bid to save £16m each year, LU has announced it will be losing around 700-800 roles on the Tube. In a press release today (where the focus is on " vision for a safe, efficient and transformed Tube " - sad how lots of visionary releases tend to hide bad news for other people), London Underground stated there would be no compulsory redundancies and they would look to re-focus staff to areas of greater customer need. No changes will be introduced without consultation with staff and trade unions. It's unlikely the unions will take news of cuts lightly, so I bet the likelihood of threats of industrial action to be high. Union leaders have already told the BBC of their disappointment with Bob Crow leader of the RMT in bullish mode & dismissive of LU's safety reassurances: " If these cuts to jobs are bulldozed through by Transport for London it will turn London's Tube stations into a muggers' paradise ." London Underground were clear to state that there would be no ticket office closures. It was rumoured earlier this year that 1,000 jobs would go due to ticket office losses . However the value of service provided at ticket stations, particularly in peak hours, was noted. " The LU proposals would also ensure, therefore, that all stations with a ticket office will continue to do so, with opening hours reduced in some areas to reflect the decline in demand but remaining open at the busiest times to serve customers ." However Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the TSSA, said Boris Johnson had betrayed staff: " He was elected promising to keep ticket offices fully open and fully staffed. "He has now broken that promise. We shall fight this all the way if any of our members are threatened with compulsory redundancy ." Tube officials said the cuts would include 100 managers, 450 ticket office posts and up to 200 other jobs. Basically we have the " huge success " of the Oyster card to thank for the job cuts. Since its launch there has been a sharp decline in ticket sales at station offices with just one in 20 journeys paid for at the counter. iPhone users can submit refund claims for London Underground delays pretty quickly with the launch of two apps. Under the Customer Charter, if you're delayed by more than 15 minutes, you're entitled to claim the cost of your single journey on the Tube. TfL's website actually is fine for making a claim , but with an iPhone app, many people might be more likely to remember to do it. You can literally claim while your delay takes place. The company behind Tube Refund , one of the apps, says that there were approximately 1,996 delays across the Tube network last year (38 delays a week). Hopefully you're not going to get that amount personally, but the which only costs 59p, could pay for itself pretty quickly. The other app iRefund is $0.99 has fewer ratings than Tube Refund. If you have an iPhone give one a try, when you're next delayed. They'll make a useful edition to the other London Underground iPhone apps reviewed last year. Thanks to TechCrunch for the heads up on this. In the ongoing funding row with Tube Lines upgrade work, TfL are considering legal action after arbiter, Chris Bolt says London Underground has to raise £4,465m for PPP costs. In a final determination of the costs, the arbiter believes that Tube Lines' increased estimate by £65m for the cost of the next seven and half years of work is correct. Boris Johnson & TfL are none too happy about this and with a rebel rousing yell, Boris said " The Arbiter has ruled that the costs should be £4.46bn, thus demonstrating that Tube Lines' breathtaking original demand for £6.8bn was simply an attempt at daylight robbery. "Londoners will also be outraged that the Tube upgrades promised to them are now threatened. "Simply put, we are being asked to write a blank cheque in order to prop up an ailing and failing Tube Lines, and to guarantee massive and secretive payments of £400m to its shareholders, Ferrovial and Bechtel. "In other countries this would be called looting, here it is called the PPP ." The fighting talk continues with " We will fight this to the last and are seeking urgent advice on the Arbiter's idea to pass Tube Lines' obligations to raise finance on to London's fare and taxpayers. "We are therefore examining all our options, including legal remedies. " Tube Lines are quietly saying that co-operation is needed " It will be essential that it (the contract) is underpinned with a strong partnership between Tube Lines and London Underground and that both parties embrace the parameters of the agreement. " Unlikely with talk of a legal fight & Boris's sparring words. Andrew Cleaves, Tube Lines' acting chief executive, said " It is clear that the Arbiter has relied on international benchmarking to help drive down public spending and is expecting both us and London Underground to become more efficient still by adopting some of the delivery methods used by other, more modern Metro systems around the world. This will require a step change in the way that Tube Lines and London Underground work together. We will wholeheartedly welcome working more closely with LU to simplify and modernise working practices on the Underground and give Tube passengers more, for less ." Also earlier in the week TfL's interim managing director Richard Parry wrote to Bolt warning that the missing £400m would have to be found by taxpayers, in the form of higher fares, or else planned upgrade work to the Piccadilly Line would have be shelved. In today's press release Parry said " The Jubilee and Northern line upgrades are seriously delayed and over budget as a result of Tube Lines' failure to deliver, a fact now confirmed by both the PPP Arbiter and an independent QC earlier this year ." Looks like the war of words could be moving to legal arena and in the meantime, us commuters continue to bear the brunt of the stupid PPP plan, with delays to upgrades & increased fares to fund the mess. Microsoft's search engine Bing kicks off its UK TV advertising tonight with a London Underground setting. Looks like the simple question of where to catch a Tube to Euston is taken to extremes - unless they've been looking at the Human Body as a Tube Map diagram. Hopefully, this won't lead to a round of information overload for people asking for directions on the Tube. And welcome if you've come here, after searching for the London Underground on Bing. You might not find what you're looking for, but hopefully can have fun on the way.
Today is such a beautiful day! It's a day to celebrate friendship, it's a day to celebrate life and it's most definitely a day to celebrate love! I've always believed that love is something that we should show all throughout the year. Why wait for one special day to let the people in your life that matter know just how important they are to you? I try to make it my business to show my affection and appreciation all year long, but it is kinda fun to make that little extra effort on this one day.One of my favourite quotes is "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams." -Dr. SeussWho knew Dr. Seuss was so thoughtful, lol, but I couldn't agree with him more!HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY everyone....it's gonna be a lovely day:-) I came across this song, "Are You Listening?" produced by Kirk Franklin. Along with a many of today's best gospel artists , he recorded this song to help to raise money for the people in Haiti in conjunction with UNICEF. Not only is the song absolutely beautiful, but the proceeds are obviously going to a great cause. Listen, enjoy and do your part to help if you haven't already done so. I remember years ago before I had a blackerry, before I knew anything about having this type of instant access to the worldwide web, to e-mails, to google
If you'd been wondering if Draft Blogger was worth trying, any doubts should be erased right now. You need Draft Blogger to take advantage of the new template design features currently in beta. Truly, this is not something to wait for it to be released into Blogger proper. The thing is as flexible as can be. Not only are there 4 basic new templates, each with a few versions, but most of them let you change the background to one of a large variety of designs or stock photos.The fun doesn't end there. You can also customize the layout, and by customizing, I mean you can customize the overall layout of the blog's body and then pick a layout for the footer, which allows for a whole lot of variations. You can also vary the widths of the blog and the sidebars. Then you can move around your page elements/gadgets and choose colors if you don't like the defaults, and you have control over background colors for the page as well as for the gadgets, links, text, etc. As before, you can add in any header image you want, using the header element/gadget. I would think you can also use your own background images if you upload them somewhere, ie to Picasa, by going into the html and coding it in place of the images that come with the template. I haven't tried that yet.
I love what Brooke had to say about the event, and also the tidbit of advice she shared of how Eunice & Sabrina's father would read them chapter books each night, like Treasure Island. Doesn't the wedding look like it is out of a inviting and captivating storybook?(photos by Gia Canali &amp; Sara Remington) I popped by the Saipua website this morning, and was very inspired. Gorgeous, gorgeous. A beautiful, modern and minimally styled Norwegian Ski get away cottage --- yes, please. It is designed by architects Henriette Salvesen and Christopher Adams.(Images by Vincent Leroux from Maire Claire Maison) Oh, the sandals that are showing up all over the place -- I am loving some of the styles. Here are a few of my favorites, although they are a bit on the pricey side.1: Sam Edelman Dawson Gladiator $129.952: Antelope Maya $1323: Jeffrey Campbell Tier $724: Cynthia Vincent Odeon $250 Cameron Moll has come out with another lovely work of art. The Colosseo Letterpress Poster is now available. Isn't it amazing?! It is cool to watch the video clip on the site to see the process.
my handspun yarn: madder, weld, walnut, camomile In recent years spinning (with a hand spindle) is something I've enjoyed during Winter evenings, but this past Winter I looked at the spindle and the wool and just did not feel motivated. Some Winters are like that for me. I get tired easily because of the lack of sunshine. Then recently I began to think again about all the wool I have stored, some dyed and some undyed, and felt inspired. So, this time around I am spinning for Spring, and so am working toward a Spring project. At the moment I'm dyeing and spinning and then will begin to knit some kind of simple scarf-throw project. I'll begin the knitting on the Spring Equinox, the day I consider to be that all important 'first day of' - so that's this Saturday. I'll knit and continue to dye wool and spin, and will work through April, hoping to complete sometime in early May. But there's no rush. This is a project for myself, something to enjoy in the evenings now the days feel longer. The wool used is a mix of British breeds: Shetland, Shropshire and Falklands, and some merino I have had for a while. Mostly these days if I buy wool tops to dye/spin it will be from a supplier who sells rare British breeds because I find that more interesting to use. I'll hope to share the project as it moves along - in simple stripes of natural colours. I am not a very adept knitter, I like to keep it simple and can't be asked to follow knitting pattern instructions! I'll be knitting the singles rather than plyed wool because I find I can spin quite balanced singles and they knit up quite pleasantly enough. I'm dyeing the wool using mostly my tried and tested solar jar method. For dyes such as weld, I am cooking up the dried dyestuff and then straining the dye solution, pouring it into a jar to use. Some dyes, such as madder, will work well if put into the jar and covered with hot water from the kettle, but weld and alkanet for another example are dyestuffs that from my experience need a little more persuasion. I really like the yellows of weld on wool, and yellows will be the main hue for this Spring project. As a brief follow-on from yesterday's post, examples of handwriting using the same monoprint method. Yes you do need to write in mirror style. So I am constantly telling myself: b is d and d is b...... These will become something more in the near future. Thank you very much for all your comments re: yesterdays monoprint drawing post. I'm pleased you found it interesting. A drawing and its inky shadow.... the various attempts I made, working toward the one drawing I decided to use. I had the idea of a figure seated on a chair, a shape of a figure rather than a detailed human person. But the figure wears shoes. And the chair, because chairs are one of my 'things', had to be just a very simple form. The figures are all rather bizarre because I drew with my eyes closed. Yes, I do like a challenge.... but I knew this was the way for me to get the result I had in mind.... Above are photos I took whilst working on drawings for my latest zine 'dreamers' (still a few copies available in my shop ). Today (no mosaic this Monday, next week) - I thought I would finally write about my own approach to making monoprint drawings. I've written before, but several people have asked me to explain a little about how etc.. and I'm happy to put this post together, as my own technique and approach changes over time. Making these drawings does not require a printers press or any other specialist equipment. I like to make things that require the most basic of things: needle and thread, paper and pencil, and for monoprint drawing: ink/paint, glass, paper, drawing tool. I use a sheet of glass from an old picture frame. I use either printers ink (the type you might use for lino) or water-mixable oil paint. In recent times I have preferred the latter as I like the thickness and texture of the paint, it has a slow drying time and allows a variety of results: from very inky and dark, to cloudy, to light and fine lines. The paint/ink is spread across the glass quite evenly and if you prefer you can use a roller, but I use my fingers because I like the slight uneven and fingerprinty result. When I am making monoprint drawings I am working toward an expressive image, perhaps primitive, minimalist even. There are some drawings that are more elaborate but mostly I'm not aiming toward the fine exactness of an etching, for example. I'm happy to play with chance. My drawings with pencil are very different. When I draw in my sketchbook (see sketchbook sundays posts for examples), I use the eraser as a tool for both editing and blending. And I will make many adjustments sometimes before I get a pencil drawing just so. With monoprint drawing there is no rubbing out and editing a certain area, though you can work with 'mistakes' and go with the flow. A sheet of paper is placed over the inked glass and then you draw. Once you have finished drawing, you flip over the paper and there is your monoprinted image. I draw with a long darning needle. So when I am drawing I am just denting gently into the paper and not making any easily seen impression. I have to work in good light so that I can see the finely dented lines. Or I can take advantage of not seeing my drawing and can work 'blind', which offers interesting results too. Either way, I have to be careful not to lean on the paper too much, although a few inky smudges made my fingers holding the paper in place are quite acceptable and desirable for me. It's all about finding your own style and technique of working, of course. I'm showing many examples here but urge anyone who wishes to try monoprint drawing to draw in their own way and to learn through experience, which does take paper and time. Finding your own way of making marks is that big leap toward feeling like you are making something that is truly your own. I can get inspired by other artists, of course, but return again and again to my own obsessions..... Here's an example of quite a tiny drawing - showing you the inked glass image too. You can see here there is a modest about of paint smeared across the glass. This drawing was made after several previous drawings. Here's the first drawing I made during a brief session this morning. I had prepared the glass and left it a short while to allow the water-based oil paint to dry just a little. I thought I would work on a simple series of drawings to demonstrate - so chose one of my 'things' - long-eared things, rabbits and hares.... I made a series of little quirky rabbit drawings. Because my inked glass was smaller than the paper area, I lifted and shifted the paper, so that's why the glass does not match up with the drawing! I attempted to draw a girl holding a rabbit. Wishing to aim for a quite primitive drawing. You can see my attempts starting left to right. I like the first drawing best - because it features an echo of a previous drawing left in the ink, and because I like the really smudgy drawings. Shadow girl and rabbit Various drawings showing the different quality of line achieved in one drawing session. Here you can see my first drawing in the centre and then as I continued to draw so I switched paper to a smoother cartridge paper that is best for showing fine line. Further tips: experiment with using different inks, paints and colours. Do not limit yourself to one type of paper. I also try and use old envelopes, fabric, tissue paper etc.... If you are wishing to try this with young children or less able folk, and would prefer not to use glass - then try very glossy paper or plastic folders. Just smear the paint/ink across very thinly and experiment. I've made drawings in the past using the cover of an old magazine as my 'glass'. You can also use perspex of course. Instead of drawing with a needle as I do, other drawing tools to use are of course etching tools, pointed tips of ceramics tools, sharpened pencils, cocktail sticks. I hope this post has been both insightful and interesting to you. This week I am very busy working toward many new things for my shop update on the 24th. I'm also dyeing lots of wool for a particular project but I'll write about that tomorrow. Have a happy Monday x This last one is still in progress. It is in my new A3 size moleskine - so much bigger. This book will be a challenge for me. I've still quite a lot of work to do on this one, I feel, but have taken a shot just to record where I am at today. You never know, this one might change quite radically or may wait a while before I work on it some more. I've also been writing notes toward new poems. And spinning dyed wool to knit a Spring throw. I'll share more of this project next week. It has been Mothering Sunday in the UK today. A lovely Spring day. I hope you had a good one. A 'yesterdays' in grey and gold.... I wanted to make a more elaborate doll - with ruffles. Her skirt is edged with vintage velvet ribbon. She is a 'salon couture ruffles' kind of girl. Thank you for your kind comments/feedback re: my zine! I am pleased to know those who have received (UK people mostly of course) are enjoying this one. This helps me to know, cheers me as I continue to think on new ideas for both drawing and poetry. I wish you a very good weekend x A drawing from my sketchbook printed on to cotton and made into a small pillow. The pillow measures 5 inches tall and is filled with a mix of lavender with polyester stuffing. The reverse side is grey cotton (hand dyed with alkanet). I love lavender and lavender pillows. They can come in so many shapes and sizes. I've also sewn, for myself, a very simple linen dyed with alkanet pillow. I just like things very simple, some times. And as much as I love spring colours, I'm also in love with grey all year round. Perhaps this is why I like pencil drawings, pebbles, grey foliage plants, grey dresses and grey rabbits. 1. winter into spring , 2. Untitled , 3. day 64 , 4. mulberry eye , 5.

Untitled Created with fd's Flickr Toys A bright, frosty start to the week here! Many thanks to the artists and photographers featured here for sharing their work via my Flickr contacts. I've chosen a gentle selection, letting in the light and shade of Spring.... it really does, finally, feel as if we are moving toward the next brighter season here. Just a few flowers can make such a big difference. This week I've plenty to do, as always. I've got packages to send out following my shop update (thank you). There are still a few copies of my zine available. My next update will be in a few weeks time. I'll put the date here on the blog when it is decided. There will be more yesterdays! I only had a few in last Friday's selection - I shall offer a few more next time, as I do get requests and thanks. Also, my natural dyed fabrics are currently 'coming soon' in the shop. This means I am busy dyeing new new new - and by the end of this week I hope to have enough stock to make available again. Thanks for your interest. I'm enjoying my recent drawing and writing notes toward new poems. I've not updated nevering for a while. This is because I am working toward new poems for a collection - this takes time and there is a slow brew of ideas coming..... Spring usually brings a new energy to my writing. As I watch the birds and the sun lengthens the day, so my notebooks might get a little more inspired. It is paying attention to the small details of the day and adding these together, making something a little magical from the mix.... There are a few collaborative projects I am working on and I'll share more about them soon. Looking ahead to April already, I am thinking of doing some kind of month-long project. Perhaps like my November painted book. But I am still thinking on..... I hope you have a very good week and more soon x new sketches in my small moleskine sketchbook This weekend I spent some time in the garden tidying, seeing the bulbs I planted last Autumn making their way through. Lovely.... But it was cold so I worked quickly and took tea breaks, and sketched..... enjoy the rest of your Sunday

The TEN finalists with the most 'likes' will be selected on Friday (February 5). So polish up your tango shoes and hurry and go check it out. About the program: Bueno, entonces... is like Rosetta Stone meets The Simpsons - the program is comprehensive, but at the same time hilarious and really engaging. Just released last year, it has been already featured in the iTunes App Store and on the Daily Candy website. To see more, check out their Learn Spanish website . I have taken my share of Spanish classes, believe me. Some were good, some were...not so good. But none were as funny or as motivating as the Bueno, entonces... program. Witty and wry, with more than a bit of adult humor, it's like watching a favorite TV show--you can't wait for the next episode! Though it's definitely geared to the twentysomething crowd, even old folks like Tom and me laughed out loud during many of the lessons. It's sexy--in a fun way. And since this is the Sexy Spanish Club blog, well, I feel that I must recommend this as it is THE sexiest Spanish-learning program out there. The two characters--the hot Argentine teacher (Jimena) and the kinda goofy student (David) definitely develop a certain...chemistry. It makes it fun. Will they--or won't they? I'm not telling. ;-) For those planning on visiting Argentina, you should know that this is the ONLY Argentine-oriented Spanish program available. It tells you how to pronounce things the Argentine way and includes plenty of cultural references and helpful (and entertaining) slang. Plus, it's portable: it can be instantly downloaded to your iPod, iPhone, Smartphone, or laptop. No need for that sweaty bus or Subte ride to a class, and no books to lug around--just plug in and learn...and laugh! What are you waiting for, gringo? Get started on your own sexy Spanish here . No, not really. Though it's true that my husband and I just bought a small farm in Uruguay , we are keeping our studio apartment in Buenos Aires and plan to visit regularly. After all, it's only two hours away and we have two daughters living in Buenos Aires and many friends--and though we plan to live a quiet life in the country (focusing on farming and writing) we will want a blast of city life every now and then! Why did we buy the farm? It was unexpected. We visited some friends--an expat couple, British and French, who had spent twenty years in New York--who had just purchased a farm. We saw how they were living, and it was just so appealing that we couldn't get the idea out of our heads. Two weeks later, we'd bought our own place (or at least, started the process). The real estate transaction went very well--quick, smooth, very nice owners who worked with us directly without using an agent. What appeals to us about it is the challenge of living even more simply , of connecting to the land, developing (re-developing...I grew up on a farm) our skills in terms of planting, growing and harvesting our own food, and living in a 90-year-old farmhouse without succumbing to our American instincts to redo and rebuild. It's beautifully simple as is, but not perfect--and we are looking forward to being okay with that. Most of all, we love the idea of investing in land, of being in a beautiful place and getting to know our neighbors in a setting that encourages cooperation, bartering, and sharing. And okay, I can't help but think that it will be a really fun place for our eventual grandkids to visit. ;-) But Buenos Aires is in my heart and always will be. I love it, and I really appreciate the creativity of the people (locals and expats). It inspires me, makes me think, makes me laugh, and helps me appreciate life. I know I'll feel the same way about life on the farm in Uruguay--but in different ways. Thought I'd update this blog--I'm posting regularly on my New Globals blog these days. I've even posted some fun little videos about finding my book in Barnes &amp; Noble and meeting my agent for the first time (I wrote the book in Argentina and did everything via email!) and most recently, seeing my book in a bookstore window here in New York . My book , The New Global Student: Skip the SAT, Save Thousands on Tuition, and Get a Truly International Education , was published by Random House on the 19th, and Tom and I are in New York for a month. Generally, authors do a book tour sort of thing, but we're doing things differently ! We've had a great time hanging out with three of our daughters here, celebrated when our oldest earned her master's degree (at 23) and started a new job this week, and just enjoying life in the East Village. We were excited to see the print edition of Smithsonian Magazine on the racks this week! As I'm sure many of you know, their cover story for the June edition is about living in Buenos Aires, and several expats are quoted, including me. Thanks for that, Daniel Politi! ;-) The interview was done well over a year ago, but the timing worked out very well as it was published the same week as my book launched ! There was a glitch in the shipment of books to the many education bloggers, organizations and others who were supposed to receive an early copy in order to build some buzz. We found out just last week that the books are still sitting in the warehouse ! Argh. This seriously hampers marketing efforts, as you can imagine, so we're doing a little damage control and scrambling. In fact, things are likely to pick up in a big way soon: later this week, a short feature on the book will be published in USA Today and a review is scheduled to appear in the Boston Globe either the 7th or the 14th (Sunday editions). I've had some radio interviews and podcasts so far and Tom and I are learning a lot in our lunch sessions with parents (a group of parents buys us lunch, we listen to their concerns about their kids' education and share tips). In fact, we had a fabulous one in Westport, Connecticut last Friday with a dozen people in attendance. Tom was the only guy, but hey, he's used to that. Most of all, we're just enjoying the moment and feeling grateful for the opportunity to have a book published and get a chance to share this message with those who can benefit from it. If you or someone you know is strugging with college costs, disheartened by the college-prep hassle, looking for inexpensive ways to study abroad, or just ready to hear some GOOD news about U.S. education , I hope you'll consider reading or recommending my book! Learn more at http://www.NewGlobalStudent.com It's also full of inspiring stories and helpful advice for anyone-- especially families --considering spending time abroad. And to all you aspiring writers in Buenos Aires and elsewhere---keep at it! Two years ago, I had no idea what I would write about and though I hoped I'd write a book someday, I was like millions of other people with the same vague dream. Keep dreaming, but more importantly, keep writing! You just never know where it can take you. Yep. It's true. Oh, it's not that we don't love it. It's been fantastic. We chose this location (just on the edge of Belgrano) three years ago when we had two daughters living with us, and it couldn't have been more perfect in terms of proximity to their schools--Islands International School and Universidad de Belgrano, and an easy bus or train ride to Lincoln University College. Just a couple of blocks from the Subte D line (Congreso de Tucuman stop, so you almost always get a seat!) and four blocks from the Nuñez train station, with bus 29 running right in front of our apartment as well. We have great neighbors and our sweet little street is quiet with very friendly people. Our building? Love it. Only three years old, with a lovely pool and parilla area on the roof, a small gym, and a large sauna. There are only two apartments on each floor, and ours is facing the back instead of the street. Despite the fact that we're only a couple of blocks from Cabildo, what wakes us up in the morning is birds in the trees below (we're on the seventh floor). So, why are we selling it? Well, regular readers will know that I just wrote a book and in May, Tom and I will be going to the US for the book launch and promotional tour...and we have no idea how long we will be staying. It could be two months, but it might be six or eight months, depending on speaking engagements and other opportunities. Also, we purchased a studio apartment in Palermo, right on Paraguay (between Armenia and Malabia) that has been under construction and will be completed in the next month or so. PLUS, our four daughters seem reasonably launched and as empty nesters, we just don't need three bedrooms. We really like to change things up, and we've always wanted to try living in a studio apartment, so Tom and I are excited to move into the little one. That means we've decided to sell this one, despite our daughters' concerns (we've assured them that we're likely to buy another place--with at least a spare bedroom--once we get back here after the tour stuff is over). Luckily, the wonderful realtor who sold us this place--Javier--is a friend and is helping us sell this one as well. He works with Cristian Bau realtors here in Buenos Aires and he's such a good man, a pleasure to work with and we trust him completely. By the way, buying property here isn't hard as long as you've got the cash since there aren't really any mortgages--we saw this place, bought it and MOVED INTO IT--all within a month. So, anyway--if you or someone you know might be interested in buying a really nice three-bedroom, two bath apartment in a great location--and we're happy to sell most of the furnishings as well for a VERY reasonable price--let us know. It's been a fantastic place for our family and I know that whoever ends up lucky enough to live here next will enjoy it as much as we have. To see the listing with photos, go to: (SOLD--NEVER MIND!) Maya is hard at work on her other blogs so I (her husband Tom) wanted to use her traffic to recommend a guided kayak tour of the Delta that I took last week. I have been up to Tigre and the Delta several times, it is only about 30 minutes from our apartment in Belgrano via train. Though the town of Tigre itself is worth a trip, I generally skip it to get out to the islands in the Delta. Generally we have taken the Interisla Collectivos (passenger boats that act as buses between the islands) and have gotten off at a restaurant pier or someplace else to go hiking. We have also rented a house for a weekend. But, what I really wanted to do was explore the myriad of small canals and channels that the larger boats cannot get into. Based on fellow expat Jonathan Harada's advice ( http://tutoramigos.blogspot.com ) we contacted Martin at www.eldoradokayak.com . Martin met us at the station and had already purchased tickets for the collectivo (boat) out to their island camp. I have been on the same route before though it was totally different as Martin is very knowledgeable about the Delta and during the entire 1.5 hour boat ride he gave us great information about the route. The last stop of the collectivo is their camp/house. Serenely quiet, the small canal had very few houses. All that we could hear was the winds in the leaves and the chirping of the birds. Martin's partner Chapa had a light lunch ready for us, set nicely around a picnic table in the jungle clearing. Their house is simple but new, clean with full changing and shower facilities. After a brief instruction on paddling techniques we set off in double and singles--very stable kayaks that were almost brand new. Time is different in the Delta and the two-three hours we spent blissfully paddling the small canals and channels flew by. My two daughters were hesitant to go initially (worried they were not strong enough) and completely enjoyed the experience. Our route took us through darker narrow passages as well as past grand houses on one of the larger rivers and then into seemingly untouched portions of jungle. When we got back, a lovely lunch of sausage sandwiches, tomato salad and vino patero awaited. Chapa and Martin are wonderful conversationalists and our hour lunch turned into a three hour (again time in the Delta is different) discussion of Argentine politics, culture and life on the Delta. When you visit Buenos Aires take this tour, you will not be disappointed. I have traveled a fair bit and the Delta is like nowhere I have been before and Eldorado Kayaks let me see it up close and personal. Some people like to do the look-back-over-the-last-year thing on December 31st. I prefer to do the what-a-cool-year-it's-going-to-be thing on New Year's Day. For the Frost family, lots of good things are in store and already in motion. Observe: --My book, The New Global Student , will be in bookstores on May 19th. So the next six months will be devoted to pre-launch publicity as well as sketching out Book Two. Lots of exciting times ahead as we start to get media attention for the book! --Tom and I are working together. We worked together as English teachers in rural Japan when we met back in 1983, and over the years, we've had businesses together and worked side by side. But we've always had our own projects. This year, I am very excited that he will be working directly with me on the business/nonprofit projects related to my book! We've always been far better together than apart, so there's no stopping us now! ;-) --Our oldest daughter (she is 22) will complete her master's in May. She's been working full time in addition to earning her master's so May will bring some relief but also new opportunities. Cool! --Daughter Number Two (just turned 21) graduated from college in December and finished two internships in Manhattan--one at a Latino ad agency, one at MTV international. Now, she is very happily working in an Irish pub (she LOVES it!) while saving money and also working as a freelancer for the ad agency. It's great to learn how to do freelance work (and negotiate for good pay) at the age of 21. This weekend, she is moving into a new apartment (she's been living with her older sister since August) and is thrilled to be living in New York and doing her thing. --Daughter Number Three also graduated from college in December (she is 19) and was offered a job as a multilingual events coordinator for a major cruise line. Unfortunately, the earliest they can place her in a position is March, so she is arriving in Buenos Aires today to spend the next couple of months relaxing, traveling and possibly pursuing other work options if the cruise thing is taking too long. --Daughter Number Four (she is 18) is here in Buenos Aires now on her winter break from college in upstate New York. It's a chance to visit us, visit her boyfriend (okay, we know he gets top billing) and see what it's like to come back to Argentina after being away for a few months. She's going to meet her boyfriend's family out in the campo (country) for a few days, which should be interesting. She'll return to New York in a couple of weeks, continue her studies, and do an internship this summer. It looks like she'll graduate with a BS in Applied Psychology (organizational psych, really) in December. It's a year of growth, opportunities and changes--exactly what we love best. ;-) Happy New Year, everyone! Tom and I had a great time at Normal 0 M
r de Ajó--just the two of us, the beach, the sun. Though I expected more wistful moments--this being our first Christmas in 22 years without kids--there were actually just a few, and we thoroughly enjoyed celebrating Christmas in a sleepy beach town. It's not sleepy now, though--the holiday crowds were arriving as we left! There was much painting and sprucing up being done during the time we were there. It was great to be the only foreigners around--everywhere we went, people asked where we were from, were very friendly and interested and we had delightful conversations with the locals we met. Not so nice--I caught Tom's cold (I guess I had time to get sick, so I did!) and thanks to some pretty horrible coughing yesterday, I seem to have a cracked (or at the very least, very sore) rib. So, just as I was during my recovery from gum surgery a few months back, I am VERY QUIET. It hurts to breathe, let alone talk, laugh or (OUCH!) cough. But the good news is that I got my first blurb for my book--from Dan Pink , author of A WHOLE NEW MIND. I loved Dan's book so I am utterly thrilled and humbled and awed that he wrote such a nice blurb for my book cover. Here it is: "With considerable verve and tremendous insight, Maya Frost offers a primer on how to take your education -- and your life -- into your own hands. THE NEW GLOBAL STUDENT is essential reading for any family yearning to step off the treadmill and plunge into the world." -- Daniel H. Pink, author of A WHOLE NEW MIND Nice, huh? I am looking forward to getting more blurbs soon--they are being sent to my editor at Random House/Crown and she is out of the office until January 6th. Dan just sent his along to me as a courtesy since he knew I was on pins and needles. It's especially meaningful coming from Dan as he is a father of three and took his kids on a sabbatical to Japan while doing research for his manga career guide, The Adventures of Johnny Bunko . So...quiet....and thrilled. Not a bad way to spend the next couple of days. ;-)
Is your mouth watering yet? After about eating my weight in strawberries this weekend, I pureed the rest and tested out this Strawberry Lemonade Bar recipe from Baking Bites .&nbsp; It is fabulous! These perfectly pink beauties are going to be one of many treats on a dessert buffet I am putting together for an upcoming church party.&nbsp; I'm no Amy Atlas , but I'm really excited to do a dessert buffet. Do you know of any wonderful pink desserts? Thanks for subscribing! Last night I went out with a bunch of mama's from Oscar's playgroup.&nbsp; And I realized beforehand that I don't have any bags that aren't a diaper bag, tote bag, or something else large enough to accommodate sippy cups and goldfish crackers. So ... I made this little clutch using the Scrappy Clutch tutorial at From an Igloo . It was a quick (like during nap time quick) and easy project - my favorite kind!&nbsp;&nbsp; The only change I made was to pleat the bottom of the bag instead of gathering it, because my lining fabric was too thick and refused to be gathered. It is a wee bag that will only hold the essentials, but it was such a relief to not lug a big bag out the door!&nbsp; I think I like it as a clutch and love it as a make-up bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to try again with something of my own design, longer, maybe narrower, and this time I think I'll cut my fabric more thoughtfully so the pattern lines up nicely (duh). In a bit of non-craft business, can I just rave about Santa Barbara for a moment?&nbsp; Oscar and I were at the park today when I spotted a little meadow, chock-full of yellow daisies.&nbsp; It spoke to me.&nbsp; It said, "come over here and frolic and take pictures of your adorable son!"&nbsp; So I did, and it was kind of great. And then on the drive home, I saw the strawberry van that is always parked on the side of the road with a sign that says, "Picked Today!" and couldn't pass it up.&nbsp; I really like living in the center of the strawberry-growing universe. p.s. sorry to those of you living in winter wonderlands.&nbsp; :) Thanks for subscribing! Someone had a magical time at Disneyland ... Oscar proved himself a little daredevil, and went on every ride with me.&nbsp; We had so much fun! We've been spending the last several days trying to feel human again after too much partying and not enough napping.&nbsp; I think we're just about there. Sorry I don't have anything new to share today!&nbsp; Craft time is resuming tonight. Thanks for subscribing! Some of the best people in the world flew into California for the weekend and we are all spending a couple of days at Disneyland.&nbsp; No crafts to be spoken of ... just fun rides, a monte cristo sandwich , lots of board games, and hopefully a good dose of child-like wonder. I made some simple mickey shirts for our little guys to wear, freezer paper stenciled, as usual.&nbsp; I keep getting the same question - where can you buy freezer paper?&nbsp; You should be about to find it at any grocery store.&nbsp; I buy Reynold's brand, and it is usually right next to the aluminum foil and saran wrap. Have a happy weekend! Thanks for subscribing! Time for another maternity refashion.&nbsp; I found this blue t-shirt on clearance at Target for $1.50 (sorry there's no "before" photo).&nbsp; It was about two sizes larger than I would buy pre-pregnancy, which was perfect for the refashion. All I did was add 1/4" elastic to both side seams.&nbsp; I started just below the bust, secured the elastic with a few stitches, and then stretched the elastic as I sewed down the seam using a zig-zag stitch (the more you stretch the elastic, the more gathered the fabric will be).&nbsp; I stopped the elastic about 1/2" above the bottom hem of the shirt. Here's what it looks like from the inside (not my tidiest work, but oh well): Very easy!&nbsp; You still have plenty of room for the growing bump, and don't have to wear a tent.&nbsp; Hurray for that. Thanks for subscribing! We're having a girl!&nbsp; I sure hope my sewing machine is up to the task. Thanks for subscribing! I finally finished my totes and burp cloths for my giveaway winners last night.&nbsp; Sorry they took so long to sew, ladies!&nbsp; I'm putting them all in the mail today. girlfiend and Meghan will be recieiving a spring tote.&nbsp; Do you love this fabric like I do?&nbsp; It is called Flourish Floral Tiles Turquoise by Studio e Fabrics .&nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to make one for yourself, just follow my easy Spring Tote Tutorial (now updated with additional fabric dimensions if you don't want to use tea towels)! &nbsp; &nbsp; Lizzy will receive a set of 4 baby burp cloth s.&nbsp; I really love this flannel - it is bright and cheery. &nbsp; That's all for now.&nbsp; I have a big doctor's appointment today.&nbsp; Any predictions on if I'll get to use the pink baby blanket I've been crocheting all week? Thanks for subscribing! This weekend was my hubby's 30th birthday.&nbsp; I've always thought that 30 is the perfect age.&nbsp; Prime of your life. Anyway, I had plans to continue the geek-cake tradition started last year, but Jared requested a chocolate pie.&nbsp; I needed something special and homemade to add to his birthday, so I made him a freezer paper stenciled space invaders t-shirt using this cross-stitch pattern as my guide. &nbsp; While I was in stencil-mode, I made a birthday t-shirt for me and Oscar.&nbsp; Oscar's said "I love daddy" and mine said "I love Jared." Jared was so embarrassed when I wore my shirt out in public.&nbsp; But if you can't proclaim your love on a t-shirt, what's the point?&nbsp; :) &nbsp; Thanks for subscribing!
If you knew me when, you'd know I used to watch many more movies than I do now. When I started with Netflix in 2004, I saw about 300 movies each year. Lately, I've managed one DVD from Netflix each week, and one theatrical title each week. I saw only 171 movies in 2009! Pitiful. The Netflix Rating Granulizer for Greasemonkey does exactly that. Install this extension in your browser, and you'll be able to assign ratings with half a star. I used it to give The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus 3.5 stars. It's better than OK, but I didn't really like it. I have rated over 3000 titles on Netflix.com. I use Netflix as my main repository of movie ratings. I like to know how I rated a movie, in case someone asks me. Sometimes I can't remember if I've seen a movie, or if I liked it enough to see it again, so I refer to my Netflix rating. Having to refer to Netflix is inconvenient sometimes. I don't want to have to start over from scratch with ratings on every movie Web site. What if I quit Netflix? What's going to happen to all those ratings? Now I can keep them. The LikeMinds Web app allows you to take your Netflix ratings with you, or move them from one Web site to another. Right now, you can export ratings from Amazon, Blockbuster, Flixster, Imdb, Movielens, Netflix, RottenTomatoes, and Yahoo, and import to Amazon, Blockbuster, Movielens, Netflix, and RottenTomatoes. They will be adding others. It took about 10 minutes for my 3030 ratings to be imported from Netflix into LikeMinds.com. It took about a minute to download them to a file on my laptop. It's in alpha at the moment, so they are looking for feedback on problems or features and are quick to respond. Let me know if you use it, and what your experience is. Netflix has been around for 12 years. I can hardly believe it was already seven years old when I joined in 2004. However, there are still folks out there who have never joined. I was at the doctor's office a few weeks ago, and was shocked that my nurse didn't know how Netflix worked. I reckon alot of you never considered trying Netflix until someone gave you a gift subscription. So, if you got Netflix for Christmas, and you are a total newbie, please leave a comment. I'd love to meet you. Tell us what you think. The Leonard Maltin iPhone/iPod Touch app I posted about is on sale at the iTunes store for $2.99, down from $4.99. It's based on his paperback movie guide. I reckon the price drop is because of how slow the search feature is. Also, you can't find things by keyword. You have to know the exact title or name, or at least the beginning letters. If you search for movie titles containing the word "Henry", you'll get Henry V, but not The Private Life of Henry VIII. Even with these problems, I still love and recommend the app. Get it while it's on sale, and you'll get free updates when they fix these problems. Netflix recommends I watch Wings of Desire (1987) , and predicts that I will give it 3.9 stars , based on my feelings for Nosferatu the Vampyre (with Bruno Ganz), Downfall (a great movie also starring Bruno Ganz) and Big (!). The problem is I've already seen it. I rented it from Netflix in 2006 and rated it 3 stars . I guess it went out of print and then a new edition was made, but the rating I gave it in 2006 didn't transfer from that edition to this. I don't remember exactly why I gave it a lower rating. Should I re-rate it 3 stars, in total disagreement with what Netflix knows about me? Or trust Netflix? I feel bad for disagreeing with the Netflix prediction of my rating, because they spent a million dollars to improve their recommendations. Two things of note: I love Bruno Ganz, as an actor, and I rate every movie I've seen on Netflix.com. I am thrilled to learn from a comment left here by Ken, that Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide is now available on the iPhone and iPod Touch . I bought mine from the App Store for $4.99, which is a third of what the book costs. The advantages of it over other applications is that you don't have to be connected to the Internet to look up movie details. You get plot summaries, star ratings, cast and director. You can search the database by title, cast, or director to get filmographies. I do this all the time when I'm out with friends. We'll be talking about movies and they ask me what other movies has an actor been in? What other movies has someone directed? They think I'm the movie expert, and I keep them impressed by using Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide. Another advantage is that you can create your own custom lists or add to Favorites or Movies to See which you can backup online. There's also a button to add movies to your Netflix queue (requires an Internet connection). I've been waiting for this ever since I gave up my Palm T|X. A good movie guide was the only thing I missed about that Palm. I left a note on Leonard Maltin's Web site, asking that they make an app for the iPhone. I reckon I wasn't the only one who wanted it. Now my iPod Touch is complete. If you don't have iTunes or an iPhone, check out the developer's Web site for screenshots and more info. P.S. No one paid me or gave me anything to write this review.

The little copper tree and the wood on which it sits were sent to me by Aleph. I added the birthday candle and the little figures (about 1/2 inch tall). This twisting tree reminded me of the Wallace Stevens poem On the Road Home. I tried something pretty simple with this- instead of blending bits of the three photographs I liked, I just stacked them, I think this reflects the mood of mutability in the poem.Alice picks up the red king chesspiece, who does not know what force is lifting him through the air. Feeling at the mercy of forces beyond our control frequently results in reverting to the primitive (did someone say reptilian brain?).
14 x 5" About five years back, when I was just starting to paint, I emailed a well-known artist and asked him to take a look at my work and tell me what I was missing. He offered one comment that stuck with me - to pay as much attention to the edges as the content. I was too tight - too illustrative. And it's not what I wanted to achieve - I wanted to find the balance of details needed and leave the rest to impression. With each and every painting, I have to pay great attention to that fine line - not to say there are days when I desire to tighten up and other times I desire to really lay on the painterly strokes. I don't have a favorite feature in this new piece - I love all of it. That final dab of light blue on the bathing suit mattered, although I don't know what made me do it other than intuition. The edges are just as I want - allowing some to be rough and some soft. Please click here for a larger view and purchase information. 12 x 12" Front and center, on the third floor of the Art Institute, hangs Gustave Caillebotte's enormous painting 'Paris Street, Rainy Day' - certainly the biggest crowd-pleaser in the museum. There's plenty of room to not only get up close, but to back up a good 30 - 40 feet and take it all in. When I was a teenager, I would sit on the floor in front of this masterpiece and draw dozens of versions of parts of this urban scene - not knowing I'd paint it dozens of times thirty years later. My favorite feature of this new piece is the man on the far right, on his way out. I have wanted to add more movement in figures - a slight blur or even a ghost of a shape - just knowing when it's right is the tough part. And knowing how to get the idea across, without looking like my hand smudged the paint unintentionally is even harder. It's something I'm working on more and more, mostly behind the scenes. Please click here for a larger view and purchase information. 16 x 16" This new painting is the largest piece in the show - done on a cradled masonite panel - and like the painting 'Below the Belt' , I added a paprika-like ground color on top of the black and let that vibrant, warm tone show through in many of the edges as well as the floor, which is what I love most about the end result. The two figures were wonderful to paint, especially the woman who has that great S-shaped posture. Included front and center is Georgia O'Keeffe's 'Black Cross, New Mexico', one of my all-time personal favorites in the Art Institute of Chicago. Please click here for a larger view and purchase information. 9 x 12" How about a moment of Zen - forget the cold, wet, dreary weather outside and imagine yourself soaking up the warm sun on the beach all by yourself. And remember, brighter days are ahead. Not soon enough - but it's coming. My first thought about this new painting is it can best be appreciated in person. The vibrancy of the skin tones, the yellow towel and especially the turquoise water and multi-blues sky - the texture and warmth in the sand, which I used a palette knife for most of that - yes, I wish I could hold up the real thing right in front of you. As with most paintings. In the process of painting this, I did the figure first, the water next, the people walking about and in the ocean way in the distance - and then wiped the whole thing off. Those moments are funny - here I just spent hours on what I thought was nearly complete and it's as if my hand just took over and grabbed a rag and, in seconds, trashed it. So I sit there stunned for a minute, hearing that little voice that assures me it wasn't right and get over it. Just as quick as it disappeared, I start it all over again - lessons learned - which usually makes the second attempt much more successful. Now.... mix yourself a margarita and click here for a larger view and purchase information. 12 x 12" I may have said this before - when I'm in a museum, I find myself so focused on looking at people rather than the art. It's been an obsession since I was a kid - watching the human figure and studying how we move, stand, balance, sit ...... all of it. And when I start a painting, there's always something that stands out right away - a feature that is essentially why I'm interested in the photograph in the first place. In this case, I saw this gentleman and his clothes as one united, interesting form - I felt the weight of the fabric, the heavy load of the backpack and especially the zigzags created by the folds of the pants. I just love that feature. I also saw the warmth of the overall tones - the golds, reds, greys - and chose to paint a rich, paprika-like color on top of the black surface I usually start with and hoped it would peek through in parts as long as I didn't go too far and cover it all up. The challenge being to let the edges do what they do, without nit picking. Like here in the legs ..... I was so happy with the some of the red showing through the creamy wall and the looseness of the shadows around the Picasso - again allowing edges to overlap and disappear into each other. That's what I get when I stay away from small brushes - I'm forced to take more control of the strokes but I can't over-paint it. This young man was studying Picasso's 'Mother and Child', which hangs in the Modern Wing in the Art Institute of Chicago. Please click here for a larger view and purchase information. Booster Seat I and II each is 8 x 10" Whew ! All of the new paintings are officially in the Morris &amp; Whiteside Gallery , currently being hung for the three-artists-show opening Friday, the 26th and I feel I can relax a little bit. And I'm very happy to start showing you each and every painting - and if you don't mind - I want to add to that some of my favorite details or 'sweet spots' that make them special. Let me start with the paintings you see above - two women taking a rest on a bench in the Art Institute of Chicago. It's where thousands of visitors take a load off and hopefully get a boost of energy to get back to exploring. Now, you may recognize the woman on the right, I had painted her a few years back - but with this new piece, actually both paintings - I applied the oils with a palette knife, nice and thick, then carved into it with a brush, adding more detail and control. I can attest to this being more difficult and frustrating - but the challenge lies in moving the paint around, almost sculpting it in parts. Some areas have slabs of color on top of color, like in the pants and the back wall and the swirling of thick paint to move with the folds of the clothes. You may also notice, even though I'm one of three artists in this show, I titled my work "The Tute and a Tan". Let me explain how my brain works, with respect to getting the job done. I can move forward, fairly quick, if I have a specific direction. In this case, I chose to paint scenes from two of my favorite people-watching spots - the Art Institute of Chicago aka the 'Tute' - and the beach. Once I can visualize a grouping that marries well with each other, I start working. There isn't an artist that doesn't get stuck not knowing what to paint next - and this way of thinking and preparing helps me motivate. All of my paintings in the show can be viewed here - and thank you for looking. A short video can be viewed here as well. Hope you enjoy. 'Cruise Control' sold This might be a workshop meant for you - my second Field Expedition this year taking place November 1st - 5th at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I've seen the studio space, it's fabulous - and like the New York City workshop, we'll be painting in the early part of the day and photographing in the afternoons. I picked this location because it has provided me with loads of imagery for paintings - the beach, the low-country landscapes and Savannah and Charleston are near enough for a short road trip for more. Also, the fine people at the Morris &amp; Whiteside Gallery will be hosting an evening get-together at their gallery for our group and you may also be interested in scooting over to Charleston after the workshop is over, for their Palette and Palate Stroll during the weekend. Should be great fun. More information can be found here and you can call Vince Fazio at the Sedona Arts Center for further details and registration. 6 x 6" oil on masonite sold I am sure there's many of you out there that aren't embracing the snow right now. But remember, I live in the deep south, and this is not only a rare occurrence, it's an unusual opportunity for me to paint something different, and I love that. It is staggering to see my world blanketed in white - almost no hint of color anywhere - the muted, silver sky - the amazing quiet. If it wasn't for my slipping on the ice and dropping my camera right smack in the snow, I would say that day was a perfect day. I also get to play with thick, blended, warm and cool white paints - laid on thick and as heavy as the snow itself. So much fun. And I promise - the 18 new paintings you'll see in a few weeks will warm you up and remind you that brighter days are ahead.
I plan to stop being a public, personal, storyteller. Let me explain:&nbsp; I went to TED last month, which is a conference in Long Beach, and was asked to perform a 3 minute story in between speakers.&nbsp; I got up and told this story about Mulan learning about sex for the first time.&nbsp; I call it the Mulan-frog story (it begins with frogs…)&nbsp;&nbsp; It got big laughs and even a partial standing ovation at the end.&nbsp; People really loved it and I was so high and happy afterwards.&nbsp; I'm proud that I have the skill to tell a good story and make people laugh. I have a million happy memories of being onstage and making people laugh.&nbsp; There is always a dark side however.&nbsp; I am usually telling some story that could embarrass another person or I’m talking about something that irritates me about someone specific.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got home from the conference I realized that if Mulan saw my story (or a fellow student did) she could be very embarrassed.&nbsp; I was mortified and could not believe that I hadn’t considered this before.&nbsp; Mulan looks good in the story – a curious, smart nine year old.&nbsp; But the whole topic is embarrassing to a girl her age.&nbsp; I was really struck deeply about what I do onstage and the fact that I have a child.&nbsp; I hated telling stories about my mother because I knew that it could be hurtful but I did it anyway because I loved getting the laugh, I loved getting to vent, and I felt I had the right somehow to talk about her onstage.&nbsp; I guess I thought there was some sort of unwritten code that made parents fair game.&nbsp; I actually feel that’s true and if Mulan grows up and tells stories about me, no matter how unflattering, I will gladly accept that as her right.&nbsp; (I’ll be in the front row, no – wait!&nbsp; More lovingly, I will not be anywhere near the place!) But the other way around, me telling stories about her… That’s different. After much agonizing, little niggling things that I have hated for a long time about performing stories about my own life fulminated to the surface.&nbsp; I no longer wish to be so naked and bare.&nbsp; I am surprised I ever did want to do it.&nbsp; Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I did.&nbsp; I am proud that I learned to craft my experiences into a story and I am proud that I learned the craft of being on-stage.&nbsp; But now, I need to stop doing it.&nbsp; I am happily married, for one thing, and it’s boring and inappropriate to talk about.&nbsp; My daughter is ten and she reads my blog, (OMG!) she goes to my shows.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact we have spoken at length about the stories I tell about her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that, at ten, she is really capable of understanding the ramifications.&nbsp; Still, she says it’s okay to tell the Mulan-frog story.&nbsp; But ugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t think she really understands.&nbsp; I feel the need to protect her from myself! In some ways, this is just another example of our Internet age.&nbsp; When I started telling stories about my life, it was in a basement club in L.A. called Luna Park, in 1994, where the maximum capacity was 50 people.&nbsp; We were recording the shows, but it wasn’t for mass consumption.&nbsp; What I mean is that I could speak as if it were “off the record.”&nbsp; This lulled me into a sense of secrecy and intimacy and allowed me to say anything no matter how raw.&nbsp; I was uncensored. But, there is no more “off-the-record” anymore.&nbsp; Anything can be posted online.&nbsp; Immediately.&nbsp; I think this is, on balance, good – it makes people accountable in a new and direct way.&nbsp; But for me – well let’s just say I would probably never have begun telling stories about my personal life if I’d thought they could be available to any interested person, instantly.&nbsp; But once I started, I got used to the open-nature of talking about my life.&nbsp; I learned to live with the downsides, the embarrassment, possibly even when it hurt or embarrassed other people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, when blogging came along, it seemed like such a natural thing to do.&nbsp; Jill Sobule and I have been working for a few years now doing a show together.&nbsp; I tell about ten to fourteen stories in our show.&nbsp; (She sings songs, I tell stories)&nbsp; We have worked hard to make the show work dramatically and musically. I think we’ve succeeded.&nbsp; In fact, I think our show is at least as good as any other show I’ve done, maybe better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m glad I tell all those stories in our show.&nbsp; But I don’t want to tell any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories that are out there, well, they’re out there.&nbsp; But then… after this… well, I want to retire from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least for a while.&nbsp; Maybe forever, I dunno. We have about 12 scheduled shows for this year (2010).&nbsp; Mostly in the summertime and mostly in the Northeast and the Northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking this over with Jill, we have agreed to do those shows.&nbsp; We may actually add a show or two.&nbsp; We may also find a way to film our show in the autumn.&nbsp; But by the end of this year, I plan to stop doing this show.&nbsp; And then face 2011 not performing. I haven’t written in my blog because I am always so suspicious of any type of big revelation or big announcement.&nbsp; I almost felt that if I announced that I was going to stop performing, there would inevitably be some reason not to stop it.&nbsp; I have mulled this over for the last month or so.&nbsp; And it feels good.&nbsp; It feels right. Sometimes I feel that my creativity, (and not just mine, but everyone’s creativity) is like the snow on a mountaintop melting a little at a time.&nbsp; All my various outlets – performing and writing in all its manifestations -- create little rivers through which the snow can melt.&nbsp; I always liked having so many things going at once.&nbsp; I always felt that in show business, you had to have five pots on the stove just to get one of them to boil.&nbsp; I benefited from being so multi-able.&nbsp; I could do voice over and then perform at a club, I could write a monologue and then write a pilot for a TV show.&nbsp; But lately it feels that I have fragmented my focus with this policy.&nbsp; I want the snow to melt into a couple of larger rivers, not into several smaller streams.&nbsp; And so, after the TED experience, I found myself wondering what I’m doing with myself.&nbsp; How am I directing my energies?&nbsp; I began to look at the darker side of telling stories about my personal life.&nbsp; The guilt, the anguish, the desire to emphasize this over that, the slant, the small or large exaggeration, the worry that someone I’m talking about will see or hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I suppose you could say the tipping point was Mulan. Also, many things have changed.&nbsp; I am now more able to be isolated (having moved to the Midwest from Los Angeles) and conversely, I am now in more regular and intimate interdependence with people.&nbsp; I guess what I mean is that I have a husband and a child.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is already a lot of interaction in my life, and I have begun to crave more and more alone time.&nbsp; I desire privacy.&nbsp; I don’t want my personality to be so known anymore.&nbsp; (My personality has been so slutty!&nbsp; Time to join a convent!) So, in the last few weeks I have beta-tested my new views.&nbsp; And it’s already had such forceful and creative results.&nbsp; I am focusing on a couple of screenplays; with my writing partner Jim Emerson.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may or may not finish writing the memoir of my letting go of God time, “My Beautiful Loss-of-Faith Story.”&nbsp; Of course, I’ll do the Jill &amp; Julia shows with Jill Sobule during this year.&nbsp; Then I plan to hang up my mouth.&nbsp; I can see Jill and I doing another show, someday, but not until way into the future.&nbsp; (If she wants to!) (In ten years!)&nbsp; I do honestly have that fantasy.&nbsp; Or I can imagine that I will change in a few yea rs time and want to get back up on stage.&nbsp; Or maybe I will develop the skills to talk about things that aren’t so personal and private, like many other comics do.&nbsp; That could happen.&nbsp; But I doubt it.&nbsp; And at the very least, I doubt it for the foreseeable future. Anyway, here I am making a big pronouncement, just what I didn’t want to do.&nbsp; I’m trying to write this in a way that appears that I’m mindful of the unpredictable events that could occur.&nbsp; But insofar as I can plan ahead, and insofar as I can predict my attitude, and insofar as I have the ability to point myself towards one thing over another, I feel the plan to stop talking about myself publicly is right. So, this means that I won’t be blogging about my family.&nbsp; Or really blogging at all. I am so thankful for all the people who have read my blog and commented.&nbsp; Please, if you can, come to see one of the Jill &amp; Julia Shows this year.&nbsp; For me, this show is so meaningful; it’s an end of an era.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 16 years I have been getting on stage and spilling my guts while simultaneously attempting to make people laugh.&nbsp; That’s a long time.&nbsp; This decision feels like a death.&nbsp; It’s hard to envision myself as myself without the outlet and the drive to get onstage and talk about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it doesn’t seem right to continue either.&nbsp; This decision feels inevitable and yet surprising and mostly very, very right.&nbsp; I’m so excited about this, to be honest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine me, a private person!&nbsp; (I recently joked with Jim Emerson about how I feel I was a butterfly but I’m morphing into a caterpillar!) I’ll be posting all the places where Jill and I have booked shows very soon.&nbsp; Thanks for reading. Botanic Gardens, Kauai Hawaii I took this pic a few years ago when Mulan and I spent Christmas with friends in Kauai. I've been thinking about Voltaire a bit. &nbsp; In our last writing session, Jim reminded me of the poem that Voltaire wrote after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 when all the priests were railing against the people themselves for being the culprit. &nbsp;The disaster occurred because of their sinfulness. &nbsp;And now, 255 years later and we still have the like of Pat Robertson and his voodoo/pact-with-the-devil/Christian belief that Haiti brought all this on itself. Here is Voltaire's poem:&nbsp; Poem on the Lisbon Disaster - Wikisource And here is a good excerpt: What crime, what sin, had those young hearts conceived That lie, bleeding and torn, on mother's breast? Did fallen Lisbon deeper drink of vice Than London, Paris, or sunlit Madrid? In these men dance; at Lisbon yawns the abyss. Tranquil spectators of your brothers' wreck, Unmoved by this repellent dance of death, Who calmly seek the reason of such storms, Let them but lash your own security; Your tears will mingle freely with the flood. Pat Robertson is an anomaly now. &nbsp;The public is ridiculing him. &nbsp;This makes me optimistic. &nbsp;In Voltaire's time it the Catholic Church was everywhere and this was the general attitude. I really think things are changing. &nbsp;SLOWLY.&nbsp; What shocks me is that while the mainstream may mock Robertson, they don't seem to take it a step further. &nbsp;If God didn't cause the earthquake then does God cause anything? Is he a sad bystander? &nbsp;Is he able to do anything about it? &nbsp;Of course not. &nbsp;Then why believe in any God at all? &nbsp;But no one takes it that far. &nbsp;It's PC to extoll the belief that God IS there to rely on, you can cry on his shoulder, you can ask for strength. &nbsp; Why is that so acceptable? &nbsp;&nbsp; And why did the font on my blog just change? &nbsp;OH! &nbsp;I cannot stop and noodle with it, I have dinner to prepare. Val, my cat, on my desk Here is an experimental blog post - a straight-up diary of my day. So... This was my day... Got up, nudged Mulan along as she groggily got dressed for school. &nbsp; Got her breakfast and made some coffee. &nbsp;Helped her look through her homework to make sure everything was done. &nbsp;Nudged her to finish a math page and a bonus challenge homework page. &nbsp;Gave her a pre-test for her spelling quiz. &nbsp;Nudged her to get her teeth brushed and especially to floss. After she left I took the dog, Arden on a walk to Lake Michigan. &nbsp;I listened on my iphone to an audio biography about Paul Durac, a British Theoretical Physicist. &nbsp;I am convinced he had asperger syndrome only the biographer doesn't mention that. &nbsp;I get jelous of Dirac's life where everything is arranged so he can work constantly, I wish I had a Mancy (his wife's name) who made sure I was undisturbed, had food, and could take long walks. &nbsp;Today as I walk it's very deceptively icy. The sidewalks look clear but they have the thinnest layer of ice. I almost fall down a hundred times. &nbsp;I don't like the cold today. &nbsp; The lake is sad looking, a lot of dirty looking piled up snow on the edge of the lake. I look closer and see that what I thought was dirt is really sand. &nbsp;I marvel at Lake Michigan and all it's sand. Get home and Michael is completely absorbed in some lighting project at the house. &nbsp;He is a man obsessed with lighting. &nbsp;He wants to program every single light in our house so that we can stand at the door and push one button and every light we don't want on will go off. This requires a lot of work, hooking up this outlet but not that one, etc. &nbsp;He is frustrated with the software for the program and it's the third incarnation of this software he has worked with. He has been up for two nights until at least one or two a.m. working on the lighting project. &nbsp;I kid with him and say, when he gets it done I expect him to say with glee, "Now all you have to do to turn down the lights in the family room is log onto this website on your computer, enter a certain number, and the light will automatically dim!" &nbsp;He does not like my joke because you see, it's not really a joke. I leave and go get a mammogram. I have not had one for a few years. I, having had cervical cancer, should be more vigilant, but I have let things go. &nbsp;I get to the Evanston Medical Center and read the book I am completely absorbed in. "Lacuna" by Barbara Kingsolver. &nbsp;It's such a great book, a fictionalized account of a young Mexican American in the thirties who befriends Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera and Trotsky. &nbsp; I am pulled out of my reverie by a stern woman asking me to put on a gown. &nbsp;The gown is awkwardly configured so even after you tie it in the places it wants to be tied, you have to hold it closed otherwise your whole front shows as you walk down the hallway to the mammogram machine. &nbsp;The woman inside is friendly and I'm thankful for her warm hands as she manipulates my breasts this way and that. &nbsp;I think about what a weird job she has. &nbsp;I wonder if she says to people, "I just sort of fell into it." &nbsp;There is no hidden meaning in that configuration of words, I just wonder if that's the phrase she'd use. As I leave we discuss the gowns. &nbsp;She agrees, they suck. I leave and take a moment to consider that I could get a bad response on my mammogram and have cancer. I fantasize what I would do if I learned I had only one year to live. &nbsp;I decide that I would just go places to look at animals and nature and the sky at night. &nbsp;I would go to the Galapagos, or Hawaii and just sit and watch. I don't need to see any more people, I've seen big cities, but I've done it. &nbsp;I get it. &nbsp;Big vibrant city. &nbsp;I crave quiet and nature without people. &nbsp;I decide that I would have to pull Mulan out of school to go with me to Hawaii or the Galapagos. &nbsp;Of course Michael would have to come, he'd have to shut down his business and come. &nbsp;Jill Sobule would have to come too, as well as Jim Emerson. &nbsp;I guess there'd be some people. &nbsp; Then I think, it would be bad for Mulan to be pulled out of school right now because &nbsp;she is really doing well and loves her school. &nbsp;Then I remember this is all a fantasy. &nbsp;I blink back tears and come back to life. I go to my favorite bread store in Evanston. &nbsp;It's Friday and I get challah. &nbsp; I don't ask for challah bread . &nbsp;I used to do that. &nbsp
Then Michael told me that was like asking for Guinness beer. &nbsp;You just say Guinness, not Guinness beer, just as you just say challah. &nbsp;We like to buy challah for french toast on Sundays. &nbsp; I don't have Mulan with me but I remember while I'm at this store that this was where Mulan made her first decent pun. &nbsp;She said they should put a sign out on Fridays saying, "Celebrate, it's Challah-Day!" &nbsp; While I'm at the bread store I also get a turkey sandwich on their popeye bread. &nbsp;It's so good, it's worth all the points. I come home and eat my sandwich while I watch some TV footage about Haiti. I get really upset. &nbsp;I start to cry. &nbsp;It all seems so hopeless. &nbsp;What if you were stuck and had so much time before you died to know it was going to happen? &nbsp;Or worse, you didn't know if your loved ones were okay or not. &nbsp;Or even what just really happened out there. &nbsp;This is happening to someone right now. &nbsp;This makes my heart heave. I answer a few phone calls. &nbsp;I speak with a woman at Minnesota Public Radio about doing a show at the Fitzgerald theater in St. Paul in March. &nbsp;It seems like it's going to happen. &nbsp;Then I do some business paperwork, for example, I send $1000 to Sony for the rights to sing "Is That All There Is" in "Letting Go of God" for one year. Then I try to write. &nbsp;I decide my book of essays is not as important as "My Beautiful Loss Of Faith Story" the book i've been working on for years. I wonder if I can reach my goal of finishing it this year. I wonder how many years I've had this goal. I feel depressed. &nbsp;I remember we have no food in the house and Mulan is bringing a friend home after school. &nbsp; I go to the grocery store. &nbsp;I buy chicken noodle soup and oyster crackers for Mu and her friend to have after school. &nbsp;This is Mu's big TV day. &nbsp;She cannot watch any TV during the week, but on Friday after school it's a TV free-for-all. &nbsp;I also buy vegetables and after I come home, I quickly make a pasta sauce in the slow cooker. I run to meet Mu after school, but I am a few minutes late and she is nearly home and I end up meeting her half way. She has her friend with her. Mu got 100% on her spelling quiz and I am elated. &nbsp;I heat up the chicken soup for them. &nbsp;Nadia comes over to watch the girls because I have a hair appt. &nbsp;Michael has gone to work. &nbsp;I get my hair cut really short. I really look like a nun now. And I like it. &nbsp;I feel I am in "A Nun's Story" as I leave the hair salon. &nbsp;I tell myself that if my hair is going to be this short I really have to remember to wear lipstick. &nbsp;I love my hair dresser. &nbsp;She gets my hair. I come home from the salon and Michael is already home and working on his lighting project again. Mulan is upstairs in our room watching TV. &nbsp;I make everyone eat the pasta and sauce. &nbsp;It's only okay, not great. &nbsp; &nbsp;I beg everyone to watch the Netflix movie I have, "Winged Migration." &nbsp;I already saw it when it came out (in 2000) but it was so great - all about various birds' migrations across the earth. &nbsp;Michael wants to work on the lighting project, Mulan wants to watch iCarly, they don't want to watch it. &nbsp;I'm too tired to do anything useful. &nbsp;I briefly decide to go read my book in the basement, but then rally and force everyone to stop what they're doing and watch "Winged Migration." &nbsp;I really have to push. &nbsp;I momentarily hate everyone and wonder why I'm doing this. &nbsp; I think that if I'm going to die in a year I really must finish the screenplay that Jim Emerson and I are working on. We are having so much fun. &nbsp;Working with Jim has been one of my life's great joys. &nbsp;Just as I'm giving up on Mu and Michael they agree, yes, let's watch the movie together. &nbsp;I suddenly feel a huge surge of love for them. Before we watch the movie, we make popcorn in the microwave. &nbsp;Michael has experimented and experimented and if you take 1/4 cup of popcorn and a dab of oil and put it in a kid's paper lunch bag and staple the top, zap it for exactly 2 minutes, it turns out great. We watch. &nbsp;Michael loves the film but is skeptical about how much they doctored itto get certain types of shots. &nbsp;Mulan is rapt with the film, and so is Arden - it's the first time my dog watched most of a movie. &nbsp;But when it's over Mulan announces she's thrilled she's now let out of this horrible prison I've put her in, forcing her to watch this movie. &nbsp;Also, she announces that she will never eat a bird. Ohmygod, I love my family so much. Mulan goes to her room, Michael goes back to the lighting project, and I come in here and write about my day. Snow, snow, everywhere... And I love it. Wow. &nbsp;All those posts to the last blog entry have my head in constant conversation. &nbsp; I think the post that I've thought about the most was the one which indicated I was breaking the question down in a poor way. &nbsp;(Well, there were many posts pointing that out...) &nbsp;This one broke down the debate in a different way - between religion with supernatural claims and religion without supernatural claims. &nbsp; That is true. &nbsp;I guess I don't normally think of or remember that there are religions without supernatural claims. Buddhism is the only one I can think of. (Not all sects of Buddhism.) &nbsp; Or the Unitarian Church. To me, religion works best as a ritual keeper and community builder. &nbsp;These things are very important. &nbsp;In my observations - which are mostly about my upbringing in Spokane in the Catholic church and then watching my friends who have stayed in the church - the best thing they get from their religion is the shared rituals and community. &nbsp; These are the things that I really craved, in retrospect. &nbsp;I had mouthed the words and didn't think all that much about the readings, I liked Bach and the candles and the idea that I had stood in this same church year in and year out on one particular day that earmarked the dead of winter or the beginning of spring - saying the same things, hearing the same songs, watching kids grow up, flirting with boys, seeing who was getting married, mourning those who had died. &nbsp;All those things can be a part of a life without the supernatural. On the other hand, the supernatural specifics of what we were all supposed to believe were, in my opinion, &nbsp;a great hindrance to the development of a skeptical outlook and even general critical thinking skills. &nbsp;So, the ideas we were so benignly taught had an insidious price. &nbsp;We paid with our critical minds. &nbsp;SOME of my friends from Spokane, for example, have - in my humble opinion - undeveloped political opinions. &nbsp;Worse, they back off from any debate. &nbsp;They make ad homonym attacks. &nbsp;Tragically, some of them have no understanding of the tenants of other faiths, and even of their own faith. &nbsp;Sometimes it seems that they are even proud of their lack of information. &nbsp;Is the Church to blame? &nbsp;Hmmm... I kinda think so. &nbsp;I hate to say, I do. But the rituals and community continue to give. &nbsp;And I can see that it is a great value. I think the Unitarian Church can offer this, but not at the cost of your critical mind. But for me, I do not feel in need of the community anymore! &nbsp;I like the idea of it, but not the practicality of it. &nbsp;It involves a great deal of socializing and I feel that I am filled up with that. What I crave now, (and I am fifty, so maybe this is a natural thing to happen,) but I want less socializing and social obligation in my life. &nbsp;I crave quiet and contemplation. &nbsp;I want to learn. &nbsp;I feel I am hungry to learn and read and think, &nbsp;well, it's almost as if I had scurvy and were in need of an orange! &nbsp;And true learning and thinking take a lot of time and quiet. &nbsp;With a husband and a child, as well as a few very close friends, &nbsp;I feel I am up to my ears in interaction with people. &nbsp;Adding a church would put me over the edge. &nbsp;Even if Mulan may benefit from it, she would have an even more frazzled mother and I don't think that is good. ( I could just see myself getting caught up in it at first, volunteering for five committees, nodding "yes!" to the bake sale, and then being in the worst possible mood about it all for the next six months... &nbsp;Wait! This is what being at a public school is like already! &nbsp;I've so far been able to back away from most things... &nbsp;But yes, I feel guilty about it. &nbsp;Guilty or Angry? That's always my dilemma... ) I think me and my friends would have been better served by a Church that did not subscribe to supernatural beliefs. &nbsp;We would have gotten the ritual and community but not the inanity. But sometimes I wonder, would we stick to it if it didn't have a whiff of a real God on High? &nbsp; I might not have. &nbsp;It would require inculcating me about the need of community and social obligation and not about someone looking over my shoulder who could see everything. ...I wrote the above jumbled blog entry this morning and was intending all day to get back to it, reread all those wonderful posts from the last entry and rewrite it. But now it's late, and I have to fly to New York in the morning. &nbsp;So I'm just going to throw this out there. It's woefully inadequate in it's musings upon this topic. Jill Sobule and I are doing a show on Sunday night at Joe's Pub in New York and it's sold out. That is really exciting!!!! Bahai Temple, Wilmette, IL &nbsp;early Christmas morning 2009 I took this picture early this morning on my dog walk. Mulan, Michael and I opened presents, had breakfast, and then flew to L.A. &nbsp;Now I am here, and I realize how much I miss it! &nbsp;Yippity yah, five days in L.A. Not much to report, but I wrote this (below) last week and I guess I'll paste it here now... Amongst the non-believers of this world, there appears to be a split in thinking between: 1.) Those that think religion is good - regardless of truth - for some people. &nbsp;Religion is useful for those who are trying to get sober, for those who have no where to turn, for those that might not follow society's rules, for those who might not otherwise respect others, for those in complete despair, and for those that need the idea, the concept - as a new drug - to get off another one. 2.) Those who think religion and the idea of God is never good for anyone. I have always put myself in the #1 category. &nbsp; It suits me because I don't want to proclaim that seeing stark reality, which is very dark and full of potential catastrophe, is good, or possible for everyone. But this thinking is very condescending. &nbsp;It's Plato saying religion is good for the masses. &nbsp;It's Will Durant saying how religion helps to bind people together, and so for society it's good. &nbsp;It's AA using the idea of a higher power to get people to let go of another, actual drug. But #2 is so arrogant too. I mean this is all just for the rumination - religion and the idea of God is not going away and most likely never will - so this is all just blathering about the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin . &nbsp;I have always stayed away from the #2 thinking because it puts me in a position of dismissing so much in others. I am not comfortable with it. &nbsp;It's very judgey. &nbsp;Of course, that is no way to decide what you think. &nbsp;Being&nbsp; judgey &nbsp;is the point of this whole debate! But in my private thoughts, what do I really think? &nbsp;It's like a little debate between Plato and Voltaire. &nbsp;Plato did think religion was good for the masses. &nbsp;Voltaire believed religion enslaved people. Truthfully, now I'm beginning to lean towards Voltaire. I asked my husband yesterday if he thought religion did any person any good at all. &nbsp; "Think about Anne Lamott, a nice, liberal, happy Christian, " I said, &nbsp;"Or people who get off drugs and alcohol because they find Jesus. &nbsp;I mean, aren't we all better off because of that transfer of the more dangerous drug to the more benign one?" And he said, "Maybe. But now those people are primed to follow. &nbsp;Jesus might be the idea for now, but it really could be anyone. They have made themselves programmable and basically they are sheep and now anyone could lead them - it could be to the top of a mountain or it could be off a cliff." Again, I am paraphrasing and adding imagery for emphasis. &nbsp;And may I remind you that I do not hang on this guy's every word, far from it! But I thought about that all day. &nbsp;I mean, I have always thought #1 was the benevolent point of view, the humble point of view, the less-judgemental and superior point of view, but actually that is wrong!! The #1 thinking is really so cynical and superior and #2 has all this faith &nbsp;in everyone to use rationality and critical thinking to get through. &nbsp; #2 is actually the humble - or no, the optimistic point of view! &nbsp;(Not that being humble or optimistic is some sort of proof for an argument!) &nbsp;But you know, neither of these words is right, it's more like empowering - it's the empowering point of view. I have not really come to any conclusions about this. &nbsp;But I'm just realizing how there is this split in thinking and I'm not sure - I vacillate between those views. Arden, in the backseat of the just-bought mini-van, as we drove from Los Angeles to Chicago, embarking a year ago today, Dec. 17, 2008. A year ago Mulan and I, after watching a moving company depart with all of our possessions, joined Michael as we drove together from California to Illinois. &nbsp;There was a huge storm which prevented us from taking the route we wished to take - through Santa Fe and instead we drove south, through Arizona and then Texas. &nbsp;It took four days. &nbsp;We had a dog in the car who wanted to kill, really truly kill and eat, the cat in the car. &nbsp;We stopped at Motel 6s, we saw billboards in Texas that proclaimed that Obama was not born in the U.S., we watched Arden pee in ice for the first time. &nbsp;It was an adventure. We arrived here just before Christmas, slept in our new house all together on sleeping bags in the master bedroom, and wandered our neighborhood thinking, "What the hell did we just do?" And what have I done this year? &nbsp; Adjust, be a mom who's around a lot, do a few shows, write a pilot, and empty a bunch of boxes. &nbsp;The house is still not totally organized - the basement is on it's way... &nbsp;But I am much happier here and thrilled to be in this new family. &nbsp;It really does feel like a family. &nbsp;Mulan can barely remember life before Michael. &nbsp;Last night we talked about the drive. &nbsp;For Mulan, this was our biggest adventure of all. &nbsp;She often refers to the drive and wants to do it again - with the cat and the dog. (That part was not so much fun for me.) Anyway, as I have not taken a picture the last couple of days, I thought I'd throw up that one of Arden, a year ago, on his way to his own new adventure here. What am I thinking about? &nbsp;Well, I am very sad about the healthcare "overhaul." &nbsp;I am very sad about Obama and I am wondering if he is really who I thought he was. &nbsp;I read Robert Reich's and Glenn Greenwald's articles on Salon and I am just really so sad, and so disappointed, and I wish they would not vote for this deal and I like Howard Dean even more than I ever have and I hate Joe Leiberman, even though this demise is not all his doing. (Last night I overheard Mulan telling Michael, "Mom was in the car driving and yelling, 'That Joe Leiberman!' and her fists were clenched.") Anyway, let's change the subject. &nbsp;What other things am I thinking about? I am thinking about all the letters I have gotten from people and how much they mean to me. I want to write back everyone, and I hope to send at least a thank you. &nbsp;I am trying to just be present and take it all in. I am thinking about some of the questions that people have asked. &nbsp;Some people worry about having meaning in a world without god in it. &nbsp;I don't have the best answer for that yet (I am mulling on that one) but I remember once being at a convention with
Male Yellowhammer, hatched last yearMale Goldfinch, also hatched last yearBeen ringing again, this time on our monthly visit to Beeston. It was really too windy to be very productive, but we did catch the first Yellowhammer for quite some time, an array of Greenfinches and Chaffinches, and a Goldfinch.Yesterday, we were very close to catching a Sparrowhawk, but by the time we'd legged it to the net, it had got out and flown off.To make up for the disappointment, we caught three Long-tailed Tits. Two of them had consecutive ring numbers - they were the same two we'd caught together at dusk the previous month! Everyone say 'ahhhhh'...I've been so busy lately that I've barely had any time for photos during the week, and I haven't managed much at weekends either. Hopefully normal service will soon be resumed. Highlights in the garden have been up to 15 Reed Buntings and four Yellowhammers. No sign of newts in the pond yet, though there have been a few Backswimmers and Lesser Diving Beetles pootling around.photos taken with Canon EOS 30D
W elcome to the February 28, 2010 edition of Easy Street Carnival of Writing and Art. There was an electronic mountain of submissions this month. Sadly, most of them had little to do with original writing and art. What kept me going were the lovely submissions that did follow the guidelines and here they are. Do stop by their blogs to offer congratulations and encouragement. Creative Nonfiction Sarah Clark presents Sarah...Phenomenally: Divorce and Metamorphosis posted at Sarah...Phenomenally .

The World Health Organization said the Swine Flu does not appear to be spreading in a significant way. Mexican health officials have lowered its suspected death toll by 75 people, which indicates the disease is not as widespread or dangerous as originally suspected.  So far, cases of the Swine Flu outside of Mexico haven't been as severe. At this point 18 countries have reported outbreaks of the disease and significant measures have been taken in each to prevent further contamination.  Overall, initial concerns and predictions haven't been substantiated .  Originally reported by the BBC .  Scars are a part of life, but not for much longer. Scientists have discovered a drug that reduces the appearance of surgical scars.  Scaring is prevented when the compound, avotemin, is injected into the skin around a surgical incision before and after a surgery. Avotemin works to send signals between cells so the body's collagen knits more effectively, which reduces scars.  With more research the compound may result in an anti-scaring treatment. Even thought the drug is only cosmetic it can help people feel better about themselves - always a good thing. No one wants to be reminded of their injuries and illnesses.  Originally reported by Daily Mail.   A recent study on sperm may result in a win for everyone. Researchers discovered a gene mutation that causes infertility and the discovery may lead to  a cure. The discovery may also lead to the development of a male contraceptive pill. In just one study two issues may be addressed.  The researchers were initially trying to isolate genetic causes of deafness, but instead found two different DNA mutations in the CATSPER 1 gene that effected a man's ability to produce a protein related to sperm "hyperactivity," or sperms ability to move fast enough to penetrate a female egg. It is possible that antibodies could be developed that could bind to the defective protein thus creating healthy, active sperm. Additionally, the mutation would be selectively applied in pill form and create a male birth control pill. Both applications need more research and development. Nevertheless - there's hope for those who and don't want children.  Originally reported by the BBC .  Seeing is believing and a 73-year-old man that lost his eyesight thirty years ago can now believe - his sight is back. With the help of a bionic eye, Ron can now track light and make out basic shapes. He says he can short socks for the first time in thirty years.   Ron's experimental surgery took place at London's Moorfield's eye hospital. A tiny camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses transmits data via a cable to electrodes that sit upon Ron's retinas. When the electrodes are stimulated they transmit messages to the optic nerve in Ron's brain, which in turn allows him to see the light pattern experienced by the camera.  With training, patients will be able to create meaningful images based on the light patterns they can now see. To date, eighteen people have bionic eyes and more will follow.  Originally reported by the BBC.   Half a million people with severe asthma now have an effective treatment.  Two groups of researchers from the UK and Canada found injections of mepolizumab , an antibody, help reduce the frequency of severe attacks in people with asthma exacerbated. Aside from decreasing the number of attacks, the treatment also allows asthma patients to decrease their use of steroids, which have multiple negative side effects like weight gain and bone loss.  This type of asthma is linked to abnormally high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . The antibody injections bring the white blood cell count down and that prevents the server airway inflammation associated with asthma.  The treatment reduces attacks by up to 50 percent and increases the quality of life for asthma sufferers .  Originally reported by the BBC .  Learning about endangered species is no easy task. The Saharan cheetah falls into this category and is rarely seen - until now. A team from the Zoological Society of London has captured several images of the endangered animal. The images help identify individual animals and provide information about the allusive species, which little is know about.  With fewer than 250 mature individuals in the wild, the Saharan cheetah faces extinction. By gathering images of the animals that roam just six countries (Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso), zoologists hope to understand the animals' movement and ecology. This information may help save the species.  If nothing else, the images provide another face to a problem humans love to ignore - endangered species.  Originally reported by the BBC.  Photo by Farid Belbachir of the Zoological Society of London.    An allergy to peanuts is no joke. For some, just smelling peanuts can result in a fatal reaction. Which makes finding a cure all the more important and useful. A team from Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital may have done just that. The team effectively cured four children of their peanut allergy.  Over the course of six mouths, the team gave the children larger and larger exposures to peanuts to build up their bodies' tolerance to the nut. By the end of the six month period the children could eat five peanuts a day and have no reaction. This is the first food allergy to be mitigated by exposure.  Even though more testing needs to be done on the method, it does give people with the debilitating allergy hope. People with peanut allergies agonize over food products and often can't eat in certain restaurants because of the allergy.  If the allergy is curable that means improved quality of life. (It also means airlines might start serving peanuts again. Here's hoping.)  Originally reported by the BBC .  We've all done it - forgotten to charge our phone then appealed to a friend for theirs, but of course they have a different brand of phone so their charger won't work. This annoying scenario will be a thing of the past.  The major phone companies - Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, LG, T-Mobile, Orange, 3, AT&amp;T and Vodafone - have agreed to come together and create a universal phone charger that can be used with any handset model. The majority of phones will support the new charger by 2012.  Additionally, the charger will be environmentally friendly and consume 50 percent less stand-by energy compared to today's chargers.   Let's give props to the major phone companies for thinking about their customers and how they can make our lives easier. It's also impressive that they would make the charger use less energy. Too bad the iPhone isn't included!  Originally reported by the BBC . 
Well, I made it to Fairbanks. It's a beautiful first day of spring, sunny and warm - 33 degrees. Downright tropical in this part of the world. I haven't been to this region of Alaska in nearly seven years; I'm actually surprised how much of it feels familiar to me. We had a great trip up, traveling overland - the only way to travel. We took the ferry to Skagway and chugged up White Pass in my friend Bjorn's old Subaru (crossing our fingers the entire way). We visited friends in Whitehorse and continued north on the Alaska Highway to Kluane Lake, where we geared up for an overnight "ski" trip (I was on snowshoes) in the frigid mountains of the Yukon.

I realized a few weeks ago that all of my bookmark folders have, oh, tons and tons of sites marked and I can (sadly) lose track of what I actually bookmarked to enjoy. I just updated my blogroll ( now over 165 sweet blogs and sites ) with a bunch of new fab additions and wanted to share a few with you - they are lovely!! enjoy, support, love and inspire. nesting newbies :: new online lifestyle magazine run by two amazing women with a spread of food, entertaining, home design and more. and the online mag has streaming video in the articles - super creative. destined to design :: an la gal that is inspired everyday and shares it through her lovely blog. the drifter and the gypsy :: the sweet micaela's blog is full of design, photography and cool words. she also happens to be a recent Blog Out Loud panelist . sweet fine day :: an owner of a confectionery's blog?! yes! sweet, pretty and lovely photos to boot. yatzer :: my new fave innovative and eclectic "finger on the pulse" design mag that curates cool stuff. :: all images from their respective blogs :: last week at Blog Out Loud 5 , one of the lovely items in our goodie bags were cookies, generously donated from Sweet Ambs . ok, people, these cookies are -seriously- gorgeous! I felt bad eating it (but I did :) I especially love the cameo cookie and was inspired to pull another banquette seating image, one of my fave small space ideas. Spring is almost here and I am so excited for sunny long days and San Francisco fun! :: cookies by Sweet Ambs and kitchen by decorpad :: it's such a pretty day in San Francisco today and spring is on it's way! I have been thinking about coral and white - clean, romantic colors that feel good all the time. I love this striped pillow from Williams-Sonoma Home. Changing out your throw pillow covers is an easy and affordable way to change the entire vibe of your small space.&nbsp; Many of us have family heirlooms and fond knick knacks in our small spaces. I definitely believe in creating a home with items that make you feel good! Another way to create a vibe is to include furniture and decor that sparks inspiration. I am loving these colorful side tables with vintage cigar vignettes. They remind me of an outdoor cafe in Paris! Oh la la! What do you have in your small space that creates a certain vibe and/or style? :: top image via Flickr/d'alk and the other two by me :: Looking forward to seeing you there!!&nbsp; And if you want to follow us live, you can starting around 7pm PST!

When I was about in my new city, I spotted this neat backdrop featuring vintage Vogue covers and had to share it with you guys. How neat would this be framed, leaning against a wall? Or hung on wall as a backdrop to a desk area? I bet this could be an easy DIY too. Just find some vintage magazine images and make your own collection. Call a sign company and see how much it would be to print the size you need. Hmmm, more to come on this one in my own small space!&nbsp; like many of you, I heart target! i get lost in the aisles of goodies and love their designer series across the board. plus they have the best pomegranate scented candles - yes! I just spotted these exclusive keys on their site , thought they were super cute and wanted to share with you guys. often overlooked, your key ring is your first step into your small space so add a key ring that makes you happy!&nbsp; lately I've been seeing a new crop of x-benches popping up with a more industrial vibe and really am considering this look - love it! there's something classic about this style yet the it's accessible and cool! plus these pieces double, or even triple, in small spaces. i am loving the x-inspired bench that I spotted recently on a blog I recently discovered, Good Bones, Great Spaces. I love the placement under the window and that it's a bench more then an ottoman. actually, one of my first Apartment Therapy posts was about x-inspired furniture . :: image via Good Bones, Great Spaces ::
Dear friends of Bubby, Six years ago we started a blog with our grandmother, Bubby, as a way to share her wise advice with the world. We knew that everyone would love her wit, candor and compassion. This little experiment soon turned into something more special than we could have ever imagined. Within months, Bubby was receiving letters from thousands of people around the world, pouring out their hearts, and sharing their most personal stories with our grandmother. She loved offering her help. She loved reading your letters every day. She was so proud to be a Bubby to all of you. Sadly, last night, we lost our Bubby. At 94, she was still beautiful. Thank you for all of your contributions over the years. You helped make her life that much more special. With love, the granddaughters Reader Update! In July of 2006, we received a letter from a 29-year old woman with a broken heart . And this wasn't the first time she had to pick up the pieces. She and her fiance were supposed to be married in 2005, but he called it off and they parted ways. 6 months later he found his way back to her, begged for forgiveness, re-proposed, and she accepted. A few months went by and he called off the wedding again. But of course he kept her dangling and her hopes for a third reunion remained high. When you hear a story like this, you want to yell from the rooftops, "FORGET HIM!" But as we all know, the heart can be hard-of-hearing sometimes. And this girl needed some advice. Leave it to Bubby to set things straight. Bubby wasted no time referring to this man as an " immature fellow ." She wrote, " I recommend you forget him and if he calls, just tell him the party is over... There are many fish in the sea and I am sure there is one who is looking for you... Life with this person will never happen. I wish you all the happiness in the world." Even an anonymous commenter left a note saying: " Bubby's quite right. If he breaks it off once, and comes back, and all's well, fine. We all make mistakes, and we all have doubts. If he breaks it off twice?! Run, and never look back." There is nothing we love more at this website than an update letter with a happy ending. So we are pleased to report that nearly 3 years to the date of this original posting, we heard from this woman again. What do you think happened? Did he finally grow a pair? Did she learn her lesson? Did she take Bubby's advice?" Read on to find out... Dear Bubby, I wanted to write to up-date you and to thank you for the very good advice you gave me some three years ago now. My then fiance had called off our wedding for the second time and I was so distressed. You said I should forget this immature person who had wasted so much of my time. I took your advice and it really really worked out! After deciding to end all contact with my ex-fiance, I worked hard on my career and found a fantastic new job. The very first month I met a colleague in another department and, in time, we fell in love. We married last year and are now expecting our first child. With my ex, everything was difficult. With my now husband, everything is easy - we can really talk and he is so kind, fun and gentle. And, he was, from the beginning, absolutely sure about me. He is also supportive of my career as we work in the same field, something my ex never was. Really, he just cares deeply about my happiness and I couldn't imagine that I could ever love someone as much as I love him. I never would have found this wonderful man if I hadn't taken your advice. Anyway, just to thank you. Writing to you and receiving your sensible response was a great comfort to me then, and I am so grateful I listened to your wisdom. Wishing you and your family every happiness, No longer 'Heart-broken all over again.' Thank you!! xo, the granddaughters and Happy Passover! Searching for the afikomen Can be quite a chore Tipsy from the wine you drank Glasses, 1 to 4. Filling up on matzah brie Children ask, "On this night, why...?" What better way to celebrate Than to have Bubby make your seder plate. April 17, 2005: A Bubby's Passover wish for everyone April 24, 2005: 32 people around the table! April 25, 2005: Noodle Yummy on Passover? June 22, 2005: Why 8 days? Passover cartoons: Here. love, the granddaughters Happy Birthday! No, not to Bubby. One of her granddaughters is turning 31 this week! We'll be visiting Bubby over the weekend to celebrate with her. Plus, rumor is we're going to be baking hamentashins with her too. Now that's what Bubby calls a party. (By the way, if you need the recipe again, here it is . And here's the baking video we made last year.) But, back to the aging process. Here are some great birthday-themed letters that have been sent to Bubby over the years: Is it approrpriate to have a Jewish baby naming ceremony for a boy on his first birthday ? Why did he act so distant at my birthday party even though he drove 2 hours to see me? Bubby thinks you should take a cold shower and wait until your 16th birthday party. My husband forgot my birthday , what should I do? If I pretend you are my Bubby, will you send me a birthday gift? Why don't you buy him a nice broadcloth shirt or a slipover sweater for his birthday ? My boyfriend had fun on his 21st birthday , but I haven't yet. Should I marry him? Best to everyone! What an historic day! Bubby couldn't be more pleased to see Barack Obama become our new president. She was glued to CNN just like the rest of the world. Can you imagine how it must feel to be 93 and see such a pivotal moment in history?? To commemorate the day, we decided to remind you of some great letters Bubby has responded to over the years that were related to politics. Bubby reflects on Bush Bush talks to the CIA How to become President of your company How to become Vice President of your company Reflections on Reagan's funeral ceremony love, the granddaughters With the economy being what it is today, and stock markets holding your dreams at bay, your financial woes may make you shed a tear, and overdose on panic and fear. But Bubby just smiles and to us she'll say, "Don't forget. Money is round... It can roll towards you, or away." Here are some of the best "money questions" Bubby has responded to over the years. How can I retire and still take care of everyone? I'm 13 and I really, really need a job If I stayed in India I would have no money problems! My husband is so stressed about our finances I want to make more money before I propose My best friend just won a million dollars I have 7 kids to support but I hate my job love, the granddaughters Another year has gone by... Another birthday is here to celebrate. HAPPY 93 rd BUBBY! love, everyone Post your birthday wishes to Bubby in the comments below. Happy Rosh Hashana! Bubby and her granddaughters wish all of you a happy and healthy new year. Over the years we have received so many (thousands!) of touching, endearing, tearful, hopeful, soulful letters from people around the world, asking Bubby for life advice. We wish for all of you that your stories turn out happy and everyone sees all their dreams come true. And on that note, how 'bout a happy update letter ! On July 25, 2005 , we received a letter from a 25-year old woman living in Belgium who told Bubby she was planning to marry her boyfriend. She was looking for her first job after graduate school, but the only one available to her was far away in Paris. She wasn't excited about the job and didn't feel like it matched her qualifications. But she was afraid her parents would be mad if she didn't accept it. Bubby wrote her wisely, " It is a terrible feeling to get up in the morning and go to a job that you don't like or are not qualified for. Just give yourself more time to find the job for which you are trained and you are qualified." And then she added, " Don't worry about your boyfriend. If you really love one another distance will not make a difference." Bubby knows what long-distance love is like ! And she knew there was a way to solve this problem if everyone sat down to talk about it. " Put your thinking cap on!" Bubby told her. A few years went by, and on March 8, 2006 , we received a great update letter. They were still happily in love and getting married! She did find another job that she was much happier with, even though it still meant geographical distance for the couple. But they visited each other every weekend, and spoke on the phone every day. She wrote, " This is working, because we made it work, with lots of patience and love. Thanks for your nice advice to me when I asked for it... I'll send you another update for the wedding." Well, we're happy to report that she kept her word. This week we received another great update letter. She wrote: Dear Bubby, I am very happy to tell you that, due to my good job and good fortune, he was able to come join me in Paris to look for a job (which he found easily). We got married in April. We first met in 2003, and it was a difficult 5 years. We got through it, partly thanks to your advice. So thank you very much and take care. From, The Old Continent
Happy New Year everybody! What an incredible year 2009 was. It was such a great journey and I have met so many wonderful and talented people along the way. Thank you to everyone who has participated in my portrait project here. It was such an honor to have spent time with you and to take your portrait. I am so lucky to have had the chance to meet people from all over. I know some of you thought I should make myself the last portrait but I had already shot myself earlier this year. Take a scroll back and find me! But the main reason I chose not to make myself the last portrait was because I wanted to be surprised. I didn't want to plan or think about that too much. I also knew that it would be hard to choose one person so shooting a family seemed to be a great way to end the project. I have been going back and forth with whether or not I should continue the project in 2010 and I have also decided not to continue L'image Quotidienne in this new year. I am sorry if I am disappointing anyone but this project was to be for one year and although it would be great to continue on, indefinitely for that matter, there are some other projects that I would like to work on. I know I won't be able to completely stop shooting portraits of random people I see on the street but please look for those posts on my M Photo blog . Thank you everyone for your kind comments and support. I am so grateful. But before I say goodbye I wanted to leave you all with two last portraits. They are the same ladies I shot at the beginning of this blog. What a difference a year makes! And please don't forget to check out what my December portraits are into. Super cool stuff people! Thanks again and all the best in 2010!!

Here are two things I never expected to happen: one, the most amazing, is to find my name on a Forbes list . Not the one headed by Oprah, but deeply exciting all the same; I can now paraphrase all those Oscar winners and say how honoured I am to be named alongside such talent, etc, etc. The second thing is that yesterday´s pressure cooker rice was excellent. Call it risotto or call it arroz caldoso, it was just unbeleivable, as in, hard to beleive: creamy, perfectly cooked rice, full of flavour, in less than fifteen minutes from the minute I turned on the hob to sitting down? I was deeply sceptical, but figured it worth a try, and so it was. Risotto, long banished from my kitchen except as an occasional treat, comes back as a weeknight dinner staple. The rice cooker reigns supreme for white rice and for truly hands off restful cooking, but for quick and incredibly delicious results, this is the one. Here is what I did yesterday with what I had, but of course onions can take the place of leeks, chorizo for bacon if you´re so inclined, any other vetetable for the peas, and aromatics can vary: saffron, herbs, etc. Pressure cooker arroz caldoso, or risotto adapted from Lorna Sass Sautee two chopped leeks and bacon until the bacon releases its fat and the leeks begin to look floppy. Deglaze with some white wine, let it bubble up and add 1 1/2 cups short grain rice. Stir, add 3 1/2 cups of stock and cover the pressure cooker. Let it come uo to high pressure and count five minutes (five!!! seriously, aren´t you in love already?). Now release the pressure and have a look. You might want a bit more broth, or you might want to let some of it evaporate. I thought it was just fine with those meassures. Add butter and parmesan and there you are, risotto for three hungry people or four staid ones. I´m a gadget-driven cook. It´s all very well to extoll the virtues of unplugged cooking, and wax lyrical about pesto lovingly made in a pestle and mortar, but for day to day food-on-the-table purposes, I´d be lost without a Thermomix, a rice cooker, a blender and a radio.  I thought a slow cooker might be a good thing, since my favourite stews are off the radar. The idea of leaving an oven on for hours in the vicinity of a danger-seeking toddler makes me pale. Plus, with two children in the world I´m beginning to feel guilty about our fuel consumption. But slow cookers are hard to come by in Spain, and I have had a pressure cooker sitting in a cupboard since I got married almost six years ago, so yesterday I had my pressure baptism. Chickpeas in minutes convinced me in seconds, and I´ve been playing with it ever since. My first solo flight was based on this rag ù . I did´t lock the pressure valve properly, and scorched the bottom, but all the same, I had a really tasty chunky sauce that´s made a great filling for empanada . So far, so good. The chicken stock is what has me lost in wonder. I was convinced it would come out cloudy, but tried it anyway, thinking P í a wouldn´t mind. But amazingly, in 45 minutes I had a pot of golden, beautiful, clear broth. I did skim it before locking the lid, mind you, but it didn´t take so long. So now, instead of making a giant 5 litre batch of stock every month or so, I´ll make a amaller 2 litre batch all the time. It´s magic! I have a chunk of pork shoulder marinating even as we speak, waiting to be turned into melt-in-the-mouth shreds of aromatic meat for tomorrow´s lunch. I´ve only been using the pressure cooking for 24 hours, so maybe it´s just a coup de foudre and I´ll drop it in a week. But I don´t think so. I think I´ll be making a lot more beans and curries and stews, and can´t wait for Lorna Sass´ book to arrive. In the meantime, it´s risotto tonigth with this morning´s chicken stock. And if that works, well, then I can see myself becoming the official pressure cooker bore, as well as the official rice cooker bore. After months of bot being allowed to eat rare red meat, I´m craving a burger bigtime. But I think burgers are best left to professionals, and are best had in greasy, smoky places, and I´m not about to take my precious new baby there, yet, lest he come back smeared with ketchup. A good home alternative? A Pepito. Ask for a pepito anywhere in Spain and you will be given a steak sandwich. If you´re lucky, it will be a thin, juicy paillard type thing, and the oil and meat juices will soak into good, crunchy bread. If you´re not , which is more often the case, you will receive a slab of grey cardboard hunkering between two slabs of nothing bread. This is sad. This is not the sort of sandwich one wants as the namesake for a son and heir. It is a sad testament to the terrible lack of imagination most of Spain gives it sandwiches. To my mind, a proper pepito should have something sharp, like mustard or horseradish. Something crunchy, like cornichons. Greens, like ruccola. Butter, if J isn´t looking. And some slippery onions, either just made, or in the lovely form of onion jam . As for the meat, I favour a thick steak, salted, then marinated overnight in whatever´s around. This time it was olive oil, two smashed cloves of garlic, a sprinkling of thyme, a splash of sherry and some fish sauce, but anything goes. Sear it so it´s black outside and pink within, let it rest while you assemble the sandwiches on a good fresh baguette, and open a couple of beers. Slice the meat thin, and sneak a few slices as you put it inside the bread. You´ll have to agree that this is a beautiful thing, and I for one would be more than glad to share a name with it. Here´s a very good reason to stop the rather infrequent postings on this blog: Pepe, two weeks old today. He was born three weeks early and so overset all my plans to stock my freezer, get a haircut and write a few posts to have as backup. It´s a pretty blissful life; sure I don´t sleep much at night, but thanks to J and my family I´m allowed to take naps at odd times, eat all sorts of delicious things practically nonstop and enjoy my beautiful babies. My chicken guy at the market is a very sweet fellow who doesn´t mind selling me only half a chicken. Free range chickens are so big that even half is over a kilo, and that´s a lot of chicken for me. Not that I dislike chicken, but I do find it hard to be fascinated by it. However, stomach flu being what it is, and my baby being now in the grip of it, chicken breast must be gently poached . So my half of a big chicken gives me one big breast half, skin off, that the butcher cuts out. The thigh and the drumstick. A wing. A piece of backbone, and the neck. Wing, neck and bone go into the freezer for the making of stock whenever my storage runs low. The other two pieces I roasted today following the method called by la Lawson " one-pan chicken ". It results in roast chicken that is quite ok, but that I am happy to leave for a sandwich or pot pie some other day. The star of the show for me are the vegetables; potatoes, onions and carrots that soak up the chicken juices and the fat, char and burn and turn crispy or melting and are just the best thing ever. This time, I spooned yogurt over them and it was quite a revelation. I´ve been down a couple of days with the stomach flu that´s going around. Whenever I´ve had stomach trouble, always the get-better food has been the same. The first day one is allowed nothing but lemon water, with sugar and maybe a little salt. Then plain white rice, perhaps some dry toast, tea, if you´re looking good, and a little boiled chicken. Next day you might progress to boiled ham, and chicken broth, or yogurt with a little stwed apple. You know that you´re definitely getting better when you´re allowed boiled potatoes, in their skins. These come with a thin trickle of olive oil and some crunchy salt, and they are the most delicious thing in the world. Not just because you know that you will soon be back to normal, but because after some days of eating really dull stuff your palate is clean, your senses are sharp and you are reminded of just how great very simple things can taste. Luckily for me, it´s come just in time to feel pleasantly detoxed and mammothly hungry for my mother´s birthday today. This is going to be a lazy post, by which I mean, I am not going to write up a recipe. The reason? Ethnic. I don´t feel I can speak with any authority or knowledge about Asian soups. I was born and have always lived in a country that used to have no immigrants, where all Chinese restaurants were called "La gran muralla" . They served fried rice and gloopy lemon chicken and if anybody ever asked for a soup there I´ve never met them. Now things have improved, and it´s possible to have pretty good stuff, at least in Madrid. Most importantly, it´s possible to buy lots of ingredients that allow you to replicate many of the lovely things found in books and around the internet. And that´s what the beauty of my lack of Asian food education comes in; my standards are so low that I just looove what I make. The fun bit with all these things is stocking up the pantry. A trip to the Mostenses market and its adjacent shops will have you coming back with bulging bags for very little money. I buy noodles, won ton wrappers, dried shiitakes, fish sauce, chili garlic sauce, Hoisin sauce, big bottles of soy sauce, sesame oil, bean sprouts, good cheap chicken, massive ginger roots, even chinese chives and bok choi and pak choy. It´s a lot of fun. You can even brave the underworld and try to eat at the subterranean restaurant in the Plaza de España parking lot, which is always packed and so rather difficult. I hear it´s great, and hope some day to put it to the test. Meanwhile, I´ll be trying to make won tons, and making lots and lots of soup. What kind? Well, on lazy days it might be instant miso soup. On more energetic ones good chicken stock with fish sauce, a hint of chili and some mint or chives. And for true soul warming stuff, filling yet light, the full on chicken noodle treatment, or a version thereof with scraps of leftover roast meat. It´s a very accomodating patron, the noodle soup, and one that always hits the spot, so have a go. Here´s Gasparini , a blog I´ve been meaning to link to for ages. It has the most drop dead gourgeous meringues, and shares the recipes, which is lovely of course. Not that I could ever make anything so pretty, ever, at any time, but isn´t it lovely to see it? I have contributed to the all around prettiness, I like to think, in the blog header and the logos, so go have a look.
One of the fun things about preparing admission files for review is looking at the names of the recommenders. By this time I am familiar with the applicants' names, but now as I check to see if each student has three letters of recommendation, I am struck by the variety - and funny - names of the numerous recommenders.
Once again, our band of "Heroes," and I put that in quotes since the increasingly dislikable James remains part of the tribe, ran up against the dreaded "P-word" at this week's Immunity Challenge - puzzle. It's really no surprise the Villain braintrust is dominating challenges when it comes to using the ole' noggin.  What is alarming is Heroes leader, J.T's decision to oust one of the tribe's most intelligent players, Tom, in favor of James with his bad leg and equally bad mojo. Clearly, our Heroes are in bad shape, both physically and mentally.  But a nasty storm is quickly moving in over at the Villains camp, as Russell prepares to rain down hell on Rob.
The first time I saw One Night With The King was on January 1 2008 and I loved it.  The movie is about the story of Esther and how she became queen.  The set, the actors, the actresses... everything was very beautiful and I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could watch it again.  And when the DVD came out, I did watch it.  Over and over and over again.
Things have been crazy. I've been of course working on my 365days project but a new distraction has come up. The Sims 3. I'm re-addicted to this game. In fact right after I post this I'm going to play it. But it's fine because my homework is done, room semi-clean, and chores have been complete. Now I'm off! Goodbye for now!
I've had a lot on my mind these past few days. And so I haven't spent much time actually blogging about my relationship with Birdie and/or Kelley. To be honest, it's all just a little bit confusing to me at the moment. I like what we've done so far, but for some reason I'm ambivalent about moving forward.
The Townehouse was the most packed I'd ever seen. It's been a while since I stood in a crowd in front of a stage, pressed up against strangers, unable to even see the performers on stage.I never knew foosball was such fun and so hilarious. We were shrieking and laughing a LOT. I like how when we get together the snacks are always amazing, and sometimes we inject each other with sterile water (some have obviously been acquiring new skills). We sure know how to have a good time.
I borrowed this dress from my roommate. It is typical American Apparel, which means it is pretty comfortable and looks good. It's perfect for those mornings when I have to rush to my 8AM class. I got this shirt about two years ago at a thrift store. It is the perfect shirt for spring. Today was the first warm day since I've been back in Vermont. Spring is certainly on it's way.
We've been on 2 Disney Cruises and going on our 3rd next month.  They are just great.  There is always so much to do or you can do nothing.    I like the 'doing nothing' part.  I go and sit at Quiet Cove Pool-the adults only pool-with a drink with an umbrella in my hand and bask in the sun.  There is nothing better than that.   All the cast members are so great and helpful.  Room service is great too!!!!  It's just so nice to sit in your room or on your verandah and eat while watching the ocean sail away.  We always have a catagory 7 state room so we have a verandah.
n June my husband and I took a trip through the Grand Tetons National Park and to Yellowstone National Park. My husband had always wanted to go there, and while I was fine with our destination, I wasn't necessarily all that excited about it. What a blessing it was to go there! I was absolutely amazed and awestruck by the beauty and grandeur of these parks. We stayed in West Yellowstone Montana at the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort while we toured Yellowstone. It was wonderful.
jet blue is by far the best airlines i have ever taken i have travel many other but with the rising cost of air-fair i traveled to fl from Boston for only 100 and was hooked they even serve  my favorite coffee dunk-ins while you kick back and watch TV or movies how much better can it get for 100 bucks please tell me if you can beat that lol thanks Jeannie
I love Continental Airlines! They never disappoint me and I am so thrilled with their service. I travel a lot and I just have thumbs up for this outstanding airline. I recommend all travelers to go through Continental Airlines. They have great employees that are so professional and so caring for us travelers. I feel special and great traveling all the time through them. If I would use another airline, it would be because I am forced to if Continental Airlines didn't take me to my destination. There are many different ways to earn mileage in this airlines.
Ginger, my daughter-in-law, just sent me this photo of my grandbabies...Ben and Charlie. Ben is a bit over 3 years and Charlie's 7 months old. My cousin saw this photo...wrote me telling me it would be a good advertisement for Cosco! Aren't they so cute and sweet...it's about time for me to go for another visit!
First off, Dw went as part of a leadership team from our denomination to assess how exactly to plant an orphanage(s). He was told before he left, that they knew that Dw's appointment was a divine assignment because of all the orphanages he has been part of, volunteered at, and supported. They also loved that we have adopted 7 kids ourselves. {I love that part too
Sebryna has learned that when she does something naughty, my response is usually "Noooo!". Now I know when she has been naughty without even looking at her because she says it herself, "Mommy, Nooooooooo!." ....only it's much cuter because she makes her voice very dramatic with a nasally sound. (Imagine someone yelling, "Hellooooooo in therrrrre" like they're calling into a cave). SO CUTE!!
This company is great.  Its a new company but its stock will truly show just how much.  They have reached some high profit numbers.  Soon to be again, and steady!
I look for Metro to become more diverse and expect them to take on a nice share of the cellular market from the "big guys" and make it more affordable to all.
I just found a beautiful little book of quotes called "Words of the Spirit, thoughts to live by" they are compiled from discourses from Para Pujya Ma. I am here in Kathmandu and have brought my camera, though unfortunately, I am unable to use my USB port and have no card reader, so I will have to paint the pictures with my words for now.
God spoke to my heart today. I have been in a season of change. It is much needed changed but it wasn't change I had control over which made me uncomfortable. So for the last 47 days of my life I have been seeking clarity and direction in my life. I have gone through so many different emotions and have questioned God over and over again. I prayed and prayed but weeks have gone by and nothing. Nothing has changed in my situation. My days are long and unproductive. I have been completely unmotivated to do anything but the absolutely necessary.
So this morning I came in early to try to get some work done. But some of my colleagues had the same thoughts and came in as soon as I got my door open. Sigh. Then my internet did not seem to want to work. Sigh. And my email was not responding. Sigh. But now, as you can see, everything is back to normal, including the time.
he MAC mini has been a great replacement server for my old Windows 2003 box.  It performs like a champ and with little to no maintenance.  I've had it running for over a year now (on 24/7 hosting several websites) and I have not had any problems.  I Upgraded the Ram to 2 gig and other than that I haven't done a thing to it.  I use a regular "pc" mouse, a mac wireless keyboard and a sony monitor.  It is the only server on my network of 2 laptops and 2 PC's.  I couldn't be happier with it and can't wait to upgrade to Leopard!
Out of all the contact lens solutions available, Clear Care by Ciba Vision does the best job at keeping my contact lenses clean and comfortable.  It's a hydrogen peroxide solution and really helps to remove any debris or deposits on my lenses.  Because my contacts are the kind that are replaced quarterly, it definitely helps keep my lenses feeling fresh even towards the time when I need to replace them.  You do have to be careful though.  It's not for rinsing your contacts and you can't put it in your eyes or you'll burn them.
Dr. Mike examined me after I had been to 10 MDs. These 10 others couldn't diagnose my illness and didn't seem to care. Dr. Mike could tell there was something really wrong and didn't want to treat me, but gave me some great advice as far as treatment I should receive. I followed that advice and am now being treated by a tremendous and brilliant MD--one outside the system I had been in. I appreciate his care, concern, and professional advice. I'm doing much better now.
SO I TOTALLY DID THE PRESCRIBED WEIGHT FOR WOMEN OF 95#s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am really proud of me. Like really, really really. It was tough. By round 5 I was mentally drained; I couldn't believe that I had 5 more rounds to do. What did I eat today? Not much.
I had Scrambled eggs with Parmesan cheese, bacon, and basil.
A decaf latte.
Our family of 4 really enjoyed our cruise on Disney Cruise Line's Wonder ship.  Even though we went off-season and it rained almost every day, it was a vacation we'll never forget.  The food was amazing and we felt like royalty every time we dined.  The shows were awesome, especially for our kids who had never seen a live theatre production before.  They also have very secure child care facilities that the kids just loved!  They thought we were dropping them off to have some parent-free fun, not the other way around!
I have to say that I really did love this bike, I owned one from 2002 to 2005!  Easy to handle and comfortable, with enough power to get me up the grades to Mammoth!People thought I was riding a harley, lol.. I was so grateful that  paid a fraction of what it would have cost me for a harley.Great gas mileage, I rode it everywhere! with the weather in Ca. and this bike. Oh My, I was in heaven!
After completing the tie I undertook the task of making 2 toddler ties for my sister-in-law Tiara's wedding. I took apart a Men's Tie and was able to make 2 toddler ties. I think I could even make one bitty baby tie with the left over. Anyway, I took apart one of Davis' ties to use as a pattern. It was really easy. I may make a pattern.
