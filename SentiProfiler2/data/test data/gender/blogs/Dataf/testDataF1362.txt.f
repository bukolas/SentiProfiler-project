Is your mouth watering yet? After about eating my weight in strawberries this weekend, I pureed the rest and tested out this Strawberry Lemonade Bar recipe from Baking Bites .&nbsp; It is fabulous! These perfectly pink beauties are going to be one of many treats on a dessert buffet I am putting together for an upcoming church party.&nbsp; I'm no Amy Atlas , but I'm really excited to do a dessert buffet. Do you know of any wonderful pink desserts? Thanks for subscribing! Last night I went out with a bunch of mama's from Oscar's playgroup.&nbsp; And I realized beforehand that I don't have any bags that aren't a diaper bag, tote bag, or something else large enough to accommodate sippy cups and goldfish crackers. So ... I made this little clutch using the Scrappy Clutch tutorial at From an Igloo . It was a quick (like during nap time quick) and easy project - my favorite kind!&nbsp;&nbsp; The only change I made was to pleat the bottom of the bag instead of gathering it, because my lining fabric was too thick and refused to be gathered. It is a wee bag that will only hold the essentials, but it was such a relief to not lug a big bag out the door!&nbsp; I think I like it as a clutch and love it as a make-up bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to try again with something of my own design, longer, maybe narrower, and this time I think I'll cut my fabric more thoughtfully so the pattern lines up nicely (duh). In a bit of non-craft business, can I just rave about Santa Barbara for a moment?&nbsp; Oscar and I were at the park today when I spotted a little meadow, chock-full of yellow daisies.&nbsp; It spoke to me.&nbsp; It said, "come over here and frolic and take pictures of your adorable son!"&nbsp; So I did, and it was kind of great. And then on the drive home, I saw the strawberry van that is always parked on the side of the road with a sign that says, "Picked Today!" and couldn't pass it up.&nbsp; I really like living in the center of the strawberry-growing universe. p.s. sorry to those of you living in winter wonderlands.&nbsp; :) Thanks for subscribing! Someone had a magical time at Disneyland ... Oscar proved himself a little daredevil, and went on every ride with me.&nbsp; We had so much fun! We've been spending the last several days trying to feel human again after too much partying and not enough napping.&nbsp; I think we're just about there. Sorry I don't have anything new to share today!&nbsp; Craft time is resuming tonight. Thanks for subscribing! Some of the best people in the world flew into California for the weekend and we are all spending a couple of days at Disneyland.&nbsp; No crafts to be spoken of ... just fun rides, a monte cristo sandwich , lots of board games, and hopefully a good dose of child-like wonder. I made some simple mickey shirts for our little guys to wear, freezer paper stenciled, as usual.&nbsp; I keep getting the same question - where can you buy freezer paper?&nbsp; You should be about to find it at any grocery store.&nbsp; I buy Reynold's brand, and it is usually right next to the aluminum foil and saran wrap. Have a happy weekend! Thanks for subscribing! Time for another maternity refashion.&nbsp; I found this blue t-shirt on clearance at Target for $1.50 (sorry there's no "before" photo).&nbsp; It was about two sizes larger than I would buy pre-pregnancy, which was perfect for the refashion. All I did was add 1/4" elastic to both side seams.&nbsp; I started just below the bust, secured the elastic with a few stitches, and then stretched the elastic as I sewed down the seam using a zig-zag stitch (the more you stretch the elastic, the more gathered the fabric will be).&nbsp; I stopped the elastic about 1/2" above the bottom hem of the shirt. Here's what it looks like from the inside (not my tidiest work, but oh well): Very easy!&nbsp; You still have plenty of room for the growing bump, and don't have to wear a tent.&nbsp; Hurray for that. Thanks for subscribing! We're having a girl!&nbsp; I sure hope my sewing machine is up to the task. Thanks for subscribing! I finally finished my totes and burp cloths for my giveaway winners last night.&nbsp; Sorry they took so long to sew, ladies!&nbsp; I'm putting them all in the mail today. girlfiend and Meghan will be recieiving a spring tote.&nbsp; Do you love this fabric like I do?&nbsp; It is called Flourish Floral Tiles Turquoise by Studio e Fabrics .&nbsp; &nbsp; If you want to make one for yourself, just follow my easy Spring Tote Tutorial (now updated with additional fabric dimensions if you don't want to use tea towels)! &nbsp; &nbsp; Lizzy will receive a set of 4 baby burp cloth s.&nbsp; I really love this flannel - it is bright and cheery. &nbsp; That's all for now.&nbsp; I have a big doctor's appointment today.&nbsp; Any predictions on if I'll get to use the pink baby blanket I've been crocheting all week? Thanks for subscribing! This weekend was my hubby's 30th birthday.&nbsp; I've always thought that 30 is the perfect age.&nbsp; Prime of your life. Anyway, I had plans to continue the geek-cake tradition started last year, but Jared requested a chocolate pie.&nbsp; I needed something special and homemade to add to his birthday, so I made him a freezer paper stenciled space invaders t-shirt using this cross-stitch pattern as my guide. &nbsp; While I was in stencil-mode, I made a birthday t-shirt for me and Oscar.&nbsp; Oscar's said "I love daddy" and mine said "I love Jared." Jared was so embarrassed when I wore my shirt out in public.&nbsp; But if you can't proclaim your love on a t-shirt, what's the point?&nbsp; :) &nbsp; Thanks for subscribing!
