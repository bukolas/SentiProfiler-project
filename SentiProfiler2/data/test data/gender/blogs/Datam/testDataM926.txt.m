I think the thing that is really interesting about the old radio programs is that you had to use your imagination a lot. You couldn’t see what was happening you could only hear it. I can still visualize Fibber McGee opening his closet door and everything falling out every show, even though I never actually saw it. You had to imagine what they were doing and what was going on. That is something I missed when it came to television and you didn’t have to use your imagination, everything was right there for you. I guess the other ones I liked there were the mysteries like The Shadow, The Whistler, and The Green Hornet. I enjoyed those too.
