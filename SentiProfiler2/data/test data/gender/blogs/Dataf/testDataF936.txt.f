You killed me last night.

In a dream.

There was is so much anger inside you. I was sleeping, Dakota laying close to my heart, his breath strong and easy against my face. In contrast, it was the sound of your haggard, fervent breath closing in on us, that woke me. Panic leaping through my body, racing to my throat, choking off words. 

The look in your eyes, so much rage, passion, undeniable heat. And while my heart knew that these would be the last few beats to ever pound against my fragile frame, I remember thinking, where was that intensity, that blazing inferno when I needed it most? When I needed you most?

You killed me last night month.
It wasn't a dream.
