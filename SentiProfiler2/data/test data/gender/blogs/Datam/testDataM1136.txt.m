How wasteful is life when you have nothing to do. How insincere one feels, how helpless and inadequate. One must keep doing. Does not matter whether it is big or small, just keep doing it. Someday someone shall recognize it. Credit is not what one would want to look for. The quality and intensity of the work is important. Credit becomes personal, individual. It shall remain within one, whereas the work done should be devoid of that individuality, should be more universal and all encompassing, including and identifiable with the common man or woman. For their benefit and well being. VK Murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the Dada Sahib Phalke Award this year. The highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. Generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. But I do not consider myself worthy of his genius. His most important works I believe were in films made by another genius, Guru Dutt.
