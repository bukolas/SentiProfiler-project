Hippocrates is known for the Hippocratic oath that medical doctors are sworn by. Hippocrates was the first known physician. His name is also where the word hypocrite originates from. I’m not sure how it correlates with medicine but I’ve come to know plenty of hypocrites. Some believe being hypocritical is sometimes in others best interest. Me? I disagree. If people ask questions they can’t handle the answer to..Why ask? I’m a rather sensitive soul yet I can appreciate brute honesty any day...over simple hypocritical bullshit! Don’t keep it Real. Keep it Sincere...Your reality may be askew from mine......
