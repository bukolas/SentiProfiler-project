Yes I know I'm not "pure" white...that's pretty obvious. And yeah my great-great grandmother was full-blooded Souix but I don't look at the American Indian as any less of a people other than the fact that their technology lagged behind much like the Africoon. The difference between the two imo is that the American Indian held high cultural and spiritual standards for themselves while the Africoon captured and sold their own kind into slavery. Yeah the American Indian was backwards in some ways but for such a simple people their culture was truly something to behold. But still I see where you're coming from on that issue and have to respect your view there. I see us all as virtually kin with only the nigger being the exception.

And I'm lost on how you can view the nigger as human. Yes they're damn close but observing their physical appearance alone proves that evolution dumped them just shy of true homo sapien. I guess if I had to classify their species I would call them "humor sapiens" eh? They sure can be funny to look at and observe in their natural ghetto habitat when they don't think whites see them. The mass infusion of white DNA into their gene pool over the past few generations is really their best hope because their behavior proves that by their own choice, they refuse to behave like humans. And it really is ONLY their behavior that forces me to consider them a separate species. All they have to do is behave like humans and I'll consider them humans. I just can't help it...Inferior art, sexual deviance, murder, theft, and other generally anti-social behavior being condoned and perpetuated by the vast majority of a creature with the intellectual capacity to know better is NOT the behavior of humans. Such behavior is the exception among us true humans while such behavior is commonplace among the nigger species. Racial impurity can be offset to at least some degree with proper behavior.
