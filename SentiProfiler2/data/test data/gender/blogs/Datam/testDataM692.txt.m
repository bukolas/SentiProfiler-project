My Way Maps for all occasions. New post by Christoph Niemann. The case for context: my opening statement for SXSW Why the way we consume and report news is wrong. All out in the open I was very surprised that none of the IPL team owners knew about the 3 under-19 draft picks in the auction, in spite of the fact the under-19 World Cup was going on that time and all the teams are all for promoting young local talent (or at least that's what they say).

Well tackled Ten seconds...is how long you're going to spend on these four pages. Ten fucking seconds. Less time than it'll take you to read this. Ten seconds to look through 100 front covers. I took five years to make them. They are a summary of my five years in MediaPunta, so don't piss me off and please spend a little more time over them, because I worked hard. Perhaps in those five years I haven't brought up a child, nor amassed a fortune, but I've done all of these front covers. And I'm proud. Of them, and to be a part of this utopia. So I'm going to suggest an exchange: my five years for two minutes of your life. Spend a few seconds on each cover, look at them with affection, slowly, even if you have to squint, and perhaps you'll surprise yourself as you discover Obama lifting the World Cup, a head filled with turf (not sawdust), a treasure map...A football magazine? Yes, but from another point of view. From now on, this is how I am going to present my designs to my clients. Categories for the Meta Awards Best Awkward Attempt to Leave The Stage from the Wrong Direction After Accepting This Award. And others... Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love If you read a site and care about its well being, then you should not block ads (or you subscribe to sites like Ars that offer ads-free versions of the site). If a site has advertising you don't agree with, don't go there. I think it is far better to vote with page views than to show up and consume resources without giving anything in return. I think in some ways the Internet and its vast anonymity feeds into a culture where many people do not think about the people, the families, the careers that go into producing a website. People talk about how annoying advertisments are, but I'll tell you what: it's a lot more annoying and frustrating to have to cut staff and cut benefits because a huge portion of readers block ads. Yet I've seen that happen at dozens of great sites over the last few years, Ars included. Nutcase Helmets Nice.

Wow. The Myth of Sex Addiction If Tiger Woods were single, would he be diagnosed with sex addiction? Probably not. Isn't it absurd that the diagnosis of a person's apparent addiction is based on his marital status? Not so absurd, psychiatrists say.

ChatRoulette, from my perspective I feel pretty depressed every time I watch people flip out about the dangers of talking to strangers. Strangers helped me become who I was. Strangers taught me about a different world than what I knew in my small town. Strangers allowed me to see from a different perspective. Strangers introduced me to academia, gender theory, Ivy League colleges, the politics of war, etc. So I hate how we vilify all strangers as inherently bad.
