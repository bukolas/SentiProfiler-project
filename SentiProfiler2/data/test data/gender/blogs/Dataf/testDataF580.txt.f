Back. Bigger. Better. Ok so I achieved 1 out of 3 of my promised Bs. I'm Back. Not bigger nor better, but I said I'd be back in February and we have a week of February left, so here I am. I'm so out of the blogging loop that I'm not even sure where to begin today. Thank you to everyone who sent me emails of support, kindness and friendship after my last blog post following the passing of my beloved best friend Alli. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to all of you, I did read them all and it was so touching to know that people from all over the world had sent their love. I have enjoyed my time offline but I'm pleased to back sharing my stories and cruising the blogosphere again. In the past five months my life has bounced up and down and up again. Constant, has been the love of family and friends and the really wonderful times I have with my little Tinker. Here we are below last week in Fiji enjoying a little family escape. My husband captured such a peaceful moment, we had a really relaxing time. Unless you count the feral hyper child on the plane. That sweet little redhead of mine is a hideous plane traveller! I'll be back soon with more news. So much has happened, I'm not even sure where to begin blogging again. I will put my thinking cap on with regards to achieving the other two Bs as promised. xx News flash! My blog will be back, bigger and better than ever in February. I've missed you all and can't wait to catch up again soon. Til then, that's all folks! xCarolyn In loving memory of my beloved best friend, Tinker's adored Godmother. Alli passed away yesterday after a long and courageous fight with cancer. Now she can finally rest peacefully. I will miss her always, forever my best friend, soulmate, Tinker's Godmother. xx This photo was taken just a few weeks ago. Special memories. Hi -big daggy wave- remember me? My surgery had to be cancelled because of an annoying infection in my lungs and now what was to be one little op is now going to be two little ops so I'm taking a little more time out while we work out the schedule of those and fuss about with phone calls to my favourite people ever. Hope you don't mind? I promise I'll be back soonish. I'll try to update my twitter account as well. My beautiful best friend Alli is in the hospital and she is very very ill so if you are the praying type I'd ask you to please get your prayers on and if you are not the praying type then please keep our beautiful girl in your thoughts. xxCarolyn image credit www.mauronne.com This beautiful image is courtesy of etsy seller lynndavis . Stunning isn't it? My friends I bid you farewell for a very short while. I will be back on the 14 th September, bigger and better. Ok well I'd prefer to be thinner and better but with all the genius inventions going on at my place I reckon I'll be double my size in 2 weeks. I am having an operation and I'll be out of action for a wee while. Don't worry I'll be just fine and I'll be back soon. I have a few exciting projects to share with you all on my return. Take care and I'll see you soon. Just don't ditch me for any of those perfect glamazon super mum blogs while I'm gone will you? x Carolyn This week's amazing giveaway had me wishing I could enter myself! I adore Gingerlilly Sleepwear, the fabric, the colours, the sexy but comfy designs and of course the gorgeous matching gift boxes... Someone is about to feel very very lucky. The little Tinker picked the winner first thing this morning under the watchful gaze of Henry and Beatrice. So, who won? -click pictures to enlarge- The 5th entrant. Who was that? Quick go back and count down... Simone you lucky duck, you are the winner!! Shoot me an email with your size and address and I will forward the details on to the lovely Vanessa so she can send out your prize. Thank you all for entering and providing such great comment about sleepwear design I think they will really be interest to Vanessa and her team. Of course the biggest thanks goes to Vanessa, thank you again for supporting Stepford Dreams with your amazing Gingerlilly Sleepwear . We love your store! xx The little Tinker is mad about funny animal videos on YouTube. I made the mistake of showing her one video of a swimming cat and ever since, she demands a new video once a day. Today's video is this silly fat cat dancing. She howls laughing and says "ok now watch it again please" over and over again. So you can thank Tinker for this week's FFF. Have a great Friday and a great weekend! Not one to blow my own horn, well not too loudly anyway... however on this occasion I feel that it is warranted. I have invented something so spectacular, something so ingenious that I may have to shut down this blog to keep up with the hoards of fans I'm likely to get once I tell you about my latest feat of brilliance. For the non-Aussies, it may not be clear why this is so fantastic but if you have ever tried a Kingston biscuit you will know that it is impossible to keep a packet in your pantry for more than oh 12 hours. Right? Well yesterday in a flash of creativity I created my very own Kingston biscuit only it's better. Seriously. Masterchef watch out because I am now the champion. Those two blonde bogans with the patronising piercing voices from QLD who are famous for 4 ingredient recipes also need to watch out because this brilliant invention requires only 2 ingredients. ANZAC biscuits and Nutella . Genius. Get 2 ANZAC biscuits and put 2 spoonfuls of Nutella between them. That is all you need to do. Now, step away from the computer, go to your pantry and try it. What kind of Aussie mum has a pantry lacking ANZAC biscuits? Now get your Nutella and get going. All those size zero glamazon mummies with your 26 children in matching outfits, your perfect show homes and your handmade, home made fancy pants everything can go and sulk in the corner with your pipe cleaners and home made spelt pretzels because this invention trumps everything. I dare you to come back here and tell me I'm not not a genius. edited to add: I've had quite a few emails from some of my overseas readers. Now don't panic. You will not miss out on my genius because the ANZAC spirit is lacking in your "cookie" aisle. Yes we say biscuit and you say cookie. Click here for my previous ANZAC post, if you scroll down you will see I have a really dead easy recipe for you to make the ANZAC biscuits at home. Even I can't ruin them, easy easy easy.
