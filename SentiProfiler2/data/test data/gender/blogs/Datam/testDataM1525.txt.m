So, because of my last post, My wife finished both Gary Unmarried and the first season of Frasier with me last night. Enjoyed Gary Unmarried immensely. Frasier is very on again/off again for me. Some are hilarious, some are funny, and some are a waste of 22 minutes. The season ender for me was in the final category. It was nothing like the rest of the show, and for me was a failed experiment.
