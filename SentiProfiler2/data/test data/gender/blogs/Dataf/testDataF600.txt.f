The Boy said that was very bad of me to say that Tangobaby is dead and that I should apologize. Apparently he was not the only one who thought&nbsp; my sensationalism was naughty. I'm sorry. I'm not dead. Even this blog isn't dead. I'm going to leave it here for posterity. So, I will try this again: Hi guys! I have a new site. Come on over and see me there because I won't be over here anymore. http:julieliveshere.com Long live julie lives here . ( http://julieliveshere.com ) --- Maybe I'm being a wee bit dramatic but I hope I did grab your attention. ;-) It finally occurred to me that I needed a different place to put my stuff that's not CALIBER or i live here:SF or HAMO . Three years ago, almost by accident, I started this blog. My goodness, what a lot has happened since then. At first I wrote about movies I'd seen and then a lot about dancing tango. Blogger was very good to me, and being a Blog of Note in 2008 gave me a taste of what the wider world of blogging was all about. It inspired me to write more, share more and try to hone my skills with storytelling, idea generation and even be cognizant of good old-fashioned grammar. I got a camera in 2008 and that exploded my world wide open again. Now I could provide my own images to accompany my own stories. The avenues for creativity seemed to grow exponentially. And then the whole aspect of using the blog as an element of change and raising awareness happened in April of 2009. Learning very personal lessons about poverty, homelessness, friendship and hardship. Along the way, I lost some friends. I think I made more than I lost. Some people wanted the old tangobaby back. I couldn't summon her. She bored me. I have so many things to tell you. About the people I meet and the things I do and hopefully it's not the same ol' same ol' but stories and ideas you'll want more of. I just can't put them here anymore. It's funny how much something like a blog template or platform can be a hindrance or boost to your&nbsp; mind's inner workings. I realize now that I've outgrown Blogger and so have moved on to this new Wordpress site. It's funny, I had been so attached to my tangobaby name. I thought I wouldn't be able to be what you thought I was without that name. I agree, it's been fun. We've had a good run. I've gotten a lot of pleasure out of being tangobaby and there's a place in my heart where shiny stilletto heels and the mournful bandoneon music still lives. But I can be so much more by just being Julie. So, I hope you'll follow along. This tangobaby place has been good to me but I'm not taking it along. See you soon. http://julieliveshere.com Janika and Gabrielle (9 months) --- The two of them arrive around 1pm, just as lunch is being served. Proud mommy Janika tells everyone, she's got a tooth! Her first tooth! Women of all ages, colors, sizes crowd around mother and child. The baby, in her light purple sweatsuit, is definitely a rock star. She loves the faces surrounding her, the attention, the laughter and arms reaching out to touch her. I'm at WDDC, otherwise known as the Women's Daytime Drop-in Center, in North Berkeley. The WDDC is a non-profit program that empowers women and children to move from the streets to a home. Not all of the women here are mothers. Some are single, older women: some homeless, some getting aid for housing. All are here for lunch and companionship. The WDDC is an unusual place. It's a home, literally. Situated in a residential neighborhood, there's a kitchen with two volunteers cooking barbequed pork and yams, a living room with sofas and chairs and books, a dining area, and then several rooms devoted for client consultations and offices. The home is old, but still, it's a home. It feels comfortable and welcoming. Instantly upon my arrival, at least three people bid me hello and ask me if I need help. I can't tell if they're working there or the clientele. I'm taken around and introduced to everyone. I tell them I'm there to collect stories, to listen, to take photos. I tell them I'm with Help A Mother Out , and that we help donate diapers here. Women who don't even have kids thank me for the diapers. Everyone realizes here that any assistance and outpouring of help benefits them all. Janika especially is so grateful for the diapers. She says," I haven't had to worry about diapers at all since the baby was born. Thank you!" Some of the women are shy. They don't want to talk or have their photo taken. A couple others want me to teach them photography. We sit around the long tables while they eat their lunches and they talk about finishing school, finding new homes, getting jobs. I will be back. --- WDDC provides ongoing and intensive counseling, case management services, daily support groups, a comprehensive children's program, a variety of referral services, and a transitional housing program for for single-parent families. Due to cutbacks, WDDC has had to lay off two key employees, one a counselor for the children.&nbsp; You can read more about WDDC here and more about Help A Mother Out here. You can donate diapers online to WDDC or other Bay Area nonprofits here. You can read more about our diaper drive and awareness raising efforts here. A few of you have been kind enough to tell me about this danged pop-up window that, well, pops up , when you come to my blog. (It happens to me too. Just click cancel and it will go away. I know, it's super annoying.) Of course, I assumed that I f'ed something up, but come to find out that it's a bug with Twitter and I actually I had nothing to do with it. See, here it is . --- However, I do have to tell some of you guys that have the embedded comments on your blogs... I can't leave comments for you. I still think it's a bug that Blogger hasn't figured out yet . What it means is that if you don't link your name to your email address or have another clear way on how to send you a message, then I might not be the only person who's trying to be in touch with you and can't. Just mentioning it, especially to those of you who might wonder why you don't get comments or emails back sometimes... --- I'm hard at work on stuff for our diaper drive and planning some photo shoots for i live here:SF. We have a new group photo up on CALIBER now... take a peek!&nbsp; You can see my haircut. ;-) It's still raining but I have more Happy for you. Gregory and Xeno. I love her. (My sister made her. Good work there.) It's rainy and grim looking outside but this little face has made the sun shine already today. You can see another image here . Grandpa on his birthday, with his girlies. --- "Other things may change us, but we start and end with the family."&nbsp; ~Anthony Brandt --- Today was one of those days that I wished I had a laptop, or even a scrap of paper, for a brain dump. All those hours in the car, coming back from LA, coming back from family, from the birthday and I had so many thoughts and ideas crawling around in my head and now they've disappeared like ghosts. With my luck, they'll wake me at 3am and then I'll try to catch them, like fireflies. We had a lovely time. Grandpa was happy. I think we tuckered him out but in a good way that I know he won't mind. The girlies are beautiful and must be renamed as Little Curly Girl's hair is straighter now. Princess Chubness is getting long and lean and is not really so chubby anymore. She's walking and growing little teeth and is sporting about ten thousand long eyelashes. It's raining and I'm home. I'm going to lie in bed and listen to it rain. Nighty nite. Hi all, Just a quick hello because I'm headed down to LA to see my grandpa on what has to be the fastest planned trip I've taken yet. He turns 94 on Friday and this seems like it's a happy/sad visit, kind of a hello/happy birthday/goodbye visit. I'm going to try to focus on the happy part and not the sad part, if I can help it. I didn't want to disappear without saying howdy, and also to let you know that I am typing this post on probably one of the most ancient laptops that still works. It's my dad's, and we actually have to preheat it, like a toaster oven, for about 10 minutes before we can use it. My mom says, "Sid, go preheat the computer so Julie can send an email to her friends!" And like 10 minutes later, I can use this thing, which makes little windy whirring noises, has a plastic floppy sticking out of the drive (remember those gadgets?!) and has the screen propped up because the hinge is broken and the screen falls over if you don't hold it up with something heavy. So while I am able, here writing on this preheated computer, I wanted to tell you that the interview I'm posting tomorrow on CALIBER is really cool and you should check it out. I have some "preheated" posts scheduled there so at least there will be something pretty to look at. Okay, catch you later, peeps. See you when I get back from LaLa Land. xoxo
