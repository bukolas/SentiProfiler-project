Annamalai Temple is an living symbol of ancient Tamil architecture. The 11 tiered East Rajagopuram towers to a height of 217 feet, while the fortified walls pierced with 4 tower entrances offer a formidable look to this vast temple complex . The Pei Gopuram, Tirumanjana Gopuram and Ammanaiammal gopuram are the other three. The 1000 pillared hall and the temple tank were built by Krishna Deva Rayarar of Vijayanagar.
