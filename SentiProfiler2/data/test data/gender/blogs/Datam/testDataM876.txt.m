couldn't believe it when I heard that Naseem soa is teaching kids of all ages at his residence. My first thought was "how could any parent take their child to him?". Are we so out of touch with what is right and wrong that we think everything is OK? What does it say about us as a society?My next thought was why the concerned authorities are allowing this to go forward? I hope that their response would not be that there are no laws in place to keep such offenders in check.
