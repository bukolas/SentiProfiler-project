Sorry, Schwim-Fans, but Ross Gellar is off the market.As reported by US Magazine, David Schwimmer (43) will soon tie the knot with his girlfriend of three years, Zoe Buckman (24). And yes, your math is correct: Daddy Schwimmer took her to get her first legal drink.Actually, that’s not entirely accurate, as the lucky couple (it’s the first marriage for both) met in England on the set of Schwimmer’s successful comedy Run Fatboy Run. And just to be clear, by “successful,” I mean, “only comedy that’s successfully made Simon Pegg not funny.” So that means Buckman has possibly been drunk since she was eighteen, which may explain her taste in men.
