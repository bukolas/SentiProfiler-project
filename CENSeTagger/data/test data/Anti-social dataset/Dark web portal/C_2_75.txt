Why do you feel it is your duty to collaborate against non-Muslims? The Taliban and Al Quaeda have killed many Muslims directly and have caused indirectly the deaths of many more when A.Q. attacked US civilians and the Taliban refused to hand over the criminals responsible. It appears that you think that all non-Muslims wish to conquer you, which is untrue. In fact, most Americans do not disrespect the Quran or the prophet (PBUH), our country was based on freedom of religion. As you know, non-Muslims do not focus on religion as much as you do, this should tell you that they also do not wish to change or erase Islam, in most cases they do not think much about other religions. The prisoners in Cuba are treated better than prisoners in your own jails. The Americans provide halal food and make arrangements for prayer calls so prisoners can practice their faith. Keep in mind that the people locked up in Cuba and waterboarded were arrested for attacking international military forces and possessing unauthorized military weapons as civilians. It isn't just as simple as Kuffirs came in and took away an innocent to torture just because he was Muslim. They arrested suspected criminals, who happened to be Muslim. Many of them were released due to insufficient evidence, but were later found to be committing terrorist acts when sent home. Many of these people are same kind of people who attacked civilians in the US on 9/11 and started this whole manhunt for those who wish to commit similar crimes. If they had not done so, a lot of deaths could have been prevented. The UN troops do not wish to invade and populate Muslim land, the mission was to catch criminals who vowed to attack innocent people all over the world and prevent them from doing so. When they catch them, they will leave and everyone will be safer in the future. A very small number of Americans have done bad things and the media has made it look like all of us are out to attack Islam and hurt Muslims. Just like the media has made Islam appear violent and Muslims to appear to be terrorists because of the actions of a small percentage of them. You commented about how many secular and nationalistic Muslims must be wiped out (if Khilafah is re-established), why would anyone wish to kill Muslims because they are not 100% practising? Please clarify that if you would? Kind regards.
