Sebryna has learned that when she does something naughty, my response is usually "Noooo!". Now I know when she has been naughty without even looking at her because she says it herself, "Mommy, Nooooooooo!." ....only it's much cuter because she makes her voice very dramatic with a nasally sound. (Imagine someone yelling, "Hellooooooo in therrrrre" like they're calling into a cave). SO CUTE!!
