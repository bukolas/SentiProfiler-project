This post was very interesting because it explained both the positive and negative side of Sickle Cell Anemia. The question at the end encouraged me to do further research and try to find other diseases that have the same heterozygote advantage. After looking on many websites I found the same disease that was posted above, Thalassemia. This disease is similar to sickle cell anemia because it is a malfunction with the red blood cells. Either there are not enough red blood cells or there isn't enough hemoglobin in the red blood cells which effects the oxygen flow. This disease is inherited from the parents of the offspring. There are four forms of this disease called Silent Carrier State, Alpha Thalassemia Trait,Hemoglobin H Disease, Alpha Thalassemia Major. The first listed had one affected gene, the second has two affected genes, the third has three affected genes and the fourth has four affected genes.
