I was looking for a small, inexpensive mp3 player for my workouts at the gym. An i-pod seemed a bit too costly for what I would use it for, so I checked out mp3 players on eBay. After doing my research, the Samsung YP T9 J seemed to be the way to go. It's small, has multiple features and is much less expensive than an i-Pod. I purchased a refurbished 2GB model on eBay for less than $50. 4GB models are also available for a bit more. I didn't think I would need anymore than 2GB at the time of purchase.
