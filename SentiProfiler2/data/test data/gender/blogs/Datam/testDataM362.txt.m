For any parent, finding out that your baby or child has cerebral palsy is nothing short of devastating. It's hard to describe the emotional turmoil you begin to go through when you hear those two words confirmed for the first time. It conjours up all sorts of terrifying thoughts, and some of these I will try to convey over the coming weeks. “Cerebral” refers to the brain and “palsy” to muscle weakness/poor control. Cerebral palsy itself is not progressive (i.e. the brain damage does not get worse). However, secondary conditions, such as muscle spasticity, can develop which may get better over time, get worse, or remain the same. Cerebral palsy is not infectious. It is not a disease and should not be referred to as such. Although cerebral palsy is not “curable” in the accepted sense, training and therapy can help improve function. Ella and her twin brother Max were born extremely prematurely at just 26 weeks gestation (3 months early), and I intend to talk about this in more detail as time progresses. Extreme prematurity (and prematurity in general) present an increased risk of developing cerebral palsy. Unfortunately, during Ella's stay in the various Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) that saved her life, she suffered extensive brain damage as a result of a fungal infection/haemorrhaging (the subject of much debate between the hospitals that looked after her!). Miraculously, and beyond all initial expectations, our little soldiers, Max and Ella, came home to us in March 2006. So to kick this off, it's now 4 months since Ella was diagnosed as showing early signs of cerebral palsy (CP). As with all things web, it's very easy to get bogged down by information overload. I know, I've been there several times! I'm hoping this blog will help to provide a central resource for other parents wanting to know more about CP, and I hope to share our personal experiences with Ella as an ongoing journal.
