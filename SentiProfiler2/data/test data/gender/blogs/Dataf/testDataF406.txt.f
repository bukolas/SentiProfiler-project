March saw two scientific studies published regarding male sexual activity. Neither study made new discoveries but confirmed what historical documents and a casual observation of life already reveal.When Dr. Stacy Tessler Lindau and Dr. Natalia Gavrilova, of the University of Chicago, found that men outlive women sexually, their study created quite a stir across news, newspapers, and social media for three days. A Google search on “men outlive women sexually” lists references to the British Medical Journal in the top four pages of search returns.The study comes from survey data of 6,000 men and women between the ages of 25 to 86 years old. Researchers conclude after age 55 men average 15 more sexually active years while women of the same age average 10 years.
