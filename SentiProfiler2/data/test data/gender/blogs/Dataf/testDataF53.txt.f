Missin' Music

My piano is in a warehouse, but two guitars are leaned up against the wall of my living room. I listen to music, but I haven't played in so long. The strings on my guitars glare at me, and dare me to tune them. 

I stopped in the music store across from my office, and walked through.
"Feel free to try anything you like out..." the guy running the place said. So I wandered about, and tried a Fender or or two. Wandered out again, and drove home. Looked at my guitars, and tuned one and strummed a bit. 

Later this evening, I stopped at the Blues Benefit for the Delta County Humane Society. And wow...I sat through some good tunes. I was only there for about an hour and a half, but my toes tapped the whole time. I wish I knew someone who'd come with me...but I don't know anyone here yet that likes that sort of thing, so I went solo. 
Course, when there's live music, I'm rarely lonely!

November 2009

I rode my bike on November 1 in Escanaba, MI! The wind ripped into every nearly-open article of clothing I wore...and I wore MANY layers. However, it was sunny, not snowing, and I was a bit stir crazy. So off I went!

To be honest, it was the first bike ride I'd taken since moving here a little over a month ago. Biking is a great way to really make sense of neighborhoods, and so as each weekend approached, I thought I'd get the chance to go...but then it would rain, or I'd have to run somewhere. So on Sunday afternoon, I had my big chance. I had great aspirations, and took off toward the lake, but the wind intensified. I coasted as long as I could, and was thankful when it was time to turn around. However, I did it, and it was a pretty good ride. 

My bike is parked along the side of the wall in the garage...next to the snow shovel. However this weekend is supposed to be warmer than normal, so it might get more road time in a couple of days. Yea!
