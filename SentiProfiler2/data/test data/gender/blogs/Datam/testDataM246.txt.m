Lists are the cotton candy of journalism--hard to resist, but not very nourishing.

Travel & Leisure Magazine has come out with such a list; it purports to tell us the world's 15 ugliest buildings. Chicago's Harold Washington Library Center, designed by Chicago architect Tom Beeby, is on it, along with Frank Gehry's Experience Music Project in Seattle and Michael Graves' Portland Building.

I've never been a big fan of the Harold Washington Library Center--its classical facade is leaden, its rooftop ornament is cartoonish and its lobby has all the grace of a shopping mall. But one of the world's ugliest buildings? Nah.

The really ugly buildings, as the story accompanying the list says, are the anonymous ones where architects aren't even trying to make a statement. And for what it's worth, the Harold Washington Library Center made the list of America's Favorite Architecture when the American Institute of Architects published the results of a national poll in 2007.
