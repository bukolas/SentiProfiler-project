My uncle for one will vouch for banning me from AlMaghrib, yes, this isn't the first time Sammo has decided she HAS HAS HAS to go to an AlMaghrib class and tell him that it would be advisable to come another weekend, that is if him and the family decide to pay us a visit (which they probably will). I love my family and relatives and they have and always will be priority, but AlMaghrib is my life now and sometimes its hard to decide between the two loves of my life.
