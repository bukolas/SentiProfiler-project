Most of the groups were filled up and no one signed up for American food. Probably, because most of the participants were American, they wanted other kinds of cuisine. It was only me and my roommate who signed up for that group. Since we had a host with us, we didnâ€™t want to impose on them if there were just two of us. Luckily, we met other conference participants and we encouraged them to join us.
