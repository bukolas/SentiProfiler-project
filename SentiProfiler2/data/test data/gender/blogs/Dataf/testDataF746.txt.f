my gosh! Lady Gaga's Bad Romance is echoing in my head! and, i think Fei have watched the video one hundred times already! LOL! yep! fei is a fan. we bought a headband with a big pink bow on it and she calls it her lady gaga headband :) aside from my last song syndrome there is another thing happening right now :) i'm releasing "Connection" a kit that i have collaborated with the brilliant Ange of Ange Designs! this kit really looks so sweet that i can almost eat it! it is jam packed with lovely papers and coordinating elements.
