As Karen and Jay mentioned, all signs point to Speaker Pelosi using the "self-executing rule" to deem the Senate health care bill passed without a full vote on anything but the reconciliation package of fixes. House Dems really don't want to have an "aye" for the Senate bill's warts on their record (the "Cornhusker Kickback" ads practically write themselves.) But I would make two points: Voters aren't aware/won't remember/don't care about parliamentary process; it will be passage or not, "yes" or "no" at issue in November. And political attack ads are neither nuanced nor given to dogged devotion to the truth. Saying, "I didn't vote to pass it, I agreed to deem it passed" is hardly a line that will stick with voters, and it invites charges of Kerryesque flipfloppery. If there's any risk in "deem and pass" (Ezra Klein thinks there is,) the fact that Democrats are pursuing it is a strong indication the Republican spook campaign succeeded. Nate Silver identifies ten House Democrats who could plausibly face primary challenges from their left if they vote "no." Interestingly, six of the ten are from New York (late filing deadline,) where the labor-powered Working Families Party has threatened to withhold support.
