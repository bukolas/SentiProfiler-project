UGH School...

I'm at school right now and it sucks. I hate high school. I mean im not gonna remember high school like others did. Like my mom and dad. Heres why. I'm going to not use the word hate because its a very strong word and yeah. Anyways. I have to say i very DISLIKe my math class because I have like the worst teacher on the whole planet. Shes like this short foreign lady. ( im not a racist im just stating a fact so dont judge me). She has this accent that i Cant really understand. She speaks vietnamese i think. Well anyway she is the most confusing teacher and I can barely understand her. I tryed so hard to focus today. I tryed to listen but then all the stupid classmates are like complaining and yelling !! UGH how do I do this!?!? Anyway so i got this tutor. Hes like really smart and intelligent.  But hes really hard. He goes off what we are learning. Not in bad way but like more in depth math. Which is cool, but hard. Sometimes he gives me problems that he said is fifth grade math and I'm like "This is not easy!!" My cousin wouldnt know how to do this! Its hard because i if i get something wrong hell like do this thing with his hands. He'll like cross his heart and say something i forgot. But its kinda funny but its not good. He a really old fashioned guy. Hes older so thats why he is a math wiz.
     So I'm worried about school because i like have this focus problem and i dont  have will power i always get people to do it for me but if i really cared i would have to do it myself. Right? And im so distracted by the stupid internet and this blog and facebook. Well I'm in art and the bell is gonna ring soon but yeah. Anyways. I dont really like school right now but if I study and try my best to focus I might actually do better.
