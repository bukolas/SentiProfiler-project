I get so emotional and then I laugh, we humans are really something.
I can enjoy reading debates on subjects that I have no opinion about but when it comes to subjects where I have choosen a point of view that is very deep in my heart I shun away and I can't continue reading. I do not want to comment.

Right now people are fighting for the right to home school in Sweden, as some religious family made some bad choices based on their beliefs. There is an article about how children learn(link below) that I agree with. I wish I had the chance to live like this when I was young. I sometimes do not understand my own children´s choices to attend school and all the things (restrictions) that goes with that.

Freedom for me is so important but I will respect my children´s choices now as well as when they grow up. Although every now and then (too often, Elena says) I ask if she wants to quit school and I reminded her how nice it was before school. FYI Elena started school when she was 9, and I am happy she waited that long at least.

Anyway I am getting lots of emails from the Swedish homeschooling group about articles and ofcourse there is lots of comments on the subject. Some are so uphauling that it is just amazing to me how we as humans can have such extreme opposite beliefs. But that is really okay. What turns my stomach is how people can judge and condemn others for their beliefs.
Well, I was just in the middle of it today and did not feel so good.
I know it can be lonely to be a warrior (my favorite definition, from Stuart Wild, I mean different from mass consciousness) but it sure is worth it.
