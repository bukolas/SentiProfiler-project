Nice little workout this morning at the BSC Westborough today. After getting to the gym I hit the treadmill for a nice 3 mile run. I started at 7.5 and quickly upped it so that the bulk of the running was over 8.0 . I ended up finishing the 3 mile run in 20:59 for an average pace of 6:59/mile with 419 calories burned. After the run I hit the free weight area for some shoulder exercises. I did standing shoulder shrugs with dumbbells, standing shoulder raises, sitting long bar pulldowns, and finished with 150 abs.
