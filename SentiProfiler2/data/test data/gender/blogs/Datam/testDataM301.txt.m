"Meanwhile, the National Geographic Society has been funding Dr. Haile-Selassie since 2005 at a new research site called Woranso-Mille in the Afar depression of Ethiopia. There his team found 4 million-year-old hominins that may help clarify a transition that occurred after Ardipithecus, the transition from Australopithecus anamensis to Lucy's species, Au. afarensis. With his impressive track record for significant discoveries and research publications, there is one thing we can be sure of—we have not heard the last from Dr. Yohannes Haile-Selassie. Today the world will witness the long-awaited roll out of Ardipithecus ramidus. And what a roll out! This new member of the hominin lineage has features that are quite unexpected because they are unlike what we see in living great apes, which share common ancestry with humans. A whole issue of Science is devoted to this creature and the work of a dedicated group of scientists who spent many years in the desolate Middle Awash project area of the Afar depression in Ethiopia. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of the Middle Awash team members over the years. Among them are many Ethiopians who started their careers in the Middle Awash more than 15 years ago as bright, dedicated students. Now they are PhDs who are spread throughout the world at prestigious institutions making significant contributions to science, not the least of which are the many papers being announced today concerning the anatomy and environment of Ardipithecus ramidus. Buried in these scientific papers is a significant mention that may pass right by many readers. In the paper entiltled ""Ardipithecus ramidus and the Paleobiology of Early Hominids,"" the authors mention how in the early 1990s, after much looking, they were only finding scrappy bits of early human fossils at Aramis. They go on to say, however, that ""... on 5 November 1994, Y.H. S. collected two hominid metacarpal fragments (ARA-VP-6/5001a and b) from the surface of an exposed silty clay..."" Those hand bones were the first bits found of what would become the substance of much of today's press announcement—the most complete skeleton of an adult early hominin since the discovery of Lucy, the australopith, in 1974. Who is its discoverer, Y.H.S.? It was none other than Yohannes Haile-Selassie, one of the Ethiopian students I mentioned.

That was 1994. Now Haile-Selassie is well known in the paleoanthropological community for another discovery and report—that of Ardipithecus kadabba, a hominin that lived over one million years earlier than Ar. ramidus.  He and his colleagues first reported on this species in 2001 and a second report followed in 2004."
