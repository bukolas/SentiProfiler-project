So, over the Thanksgiving holiday, when Number one son was home from JHU for the break -- and after we dragged him (and number two son) to the mall -- and got Number one a haircut (actually a trim) -- we wandered the mall as post-20th century consumer zombies are programmed to do. 

Hell, somebody has got to keep the economy going.  

Compulsively, I used the opportunity to inquire about my sons' ideas for Christmas and birthday presents.   Number one son is transitioning into real manhood and after mentioning Guitar Legend (a campus rage), asked for a folding chair for his room, new pillows (as the university linens package ones suck), and a vacuum cleaner.  Number two mentioned various Wii videogames that come out in February (sigh).

My number one wife tried to get some group enthusiasm for zipping off to the movie theatre to see Beowulf -- but despite the attraction of Angelina Jolie's frontal nudity (albeit "animated") -- we decided against what seemed to be an Old English pre-quel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre (well, not in Texas and without chainsaws).

So, upon passing by the Saturday Night Matinee store, we wandered in to seek out some DVDs to buy and watch at home.  This is exactly the behavior that consumer market researchers adore -- "the impulse buy."   Number one son found "Enemy at the Gates" -- a film about the confrontation of a German and Russian sniper during the battle of Stalingrad in 1942.
