My daughters were born and raised in coastal Florida, right up until we drove halfway across the country to move to Colorado in February 2009. They're both excellent swimmers even though they've never taken a lesson. Instead, they grew up in the Gulf of Mexico and in our backyard pool, where floating in a swim ring gave way to splashing around with arm floats gave way to the little kid's drowned-rat doggie paddle gave way to actual swimming and, in Kyra's case, diving.
