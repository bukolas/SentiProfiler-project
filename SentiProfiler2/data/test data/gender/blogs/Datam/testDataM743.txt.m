FOXNews.com - Pelosi Plan to Pass Health Care Without Traditional Vote Riles Critics I cannot believe the politicians we send to office. Are the politicians so afraid of not being reelected that they will not give an up or down vote? I believe that everyone should have access to healthcare, and healthcare needs to be reformed at the most basic level. It frustrates me knowing the politicians do not have the courage to represent the people. It seems every topic is split between the party lines. No politician is working for the good of the people, they are all worried about playing politics. It's actually disgusting. Come November I plan on a clean sweep.... my personal belief is, two terms and you're out. Enough of career politicians, enough of politics as usual, enough of this nonsense. I had a really good weekend, visiting with friends on Friday and Saturday evening. Friday night Susan came over and we looked at her virus protection on her laptop. Joining the crew was Dave and Sandy. Dave also brought his brand-new Dell laptop computer running Windows 7. We unpacked the laptop and got everything set up for him. This all over pizza, and in time to watch the Penguins play..... basically geek heaven. Saturday night my old friend Mark and his family came over and we went to dinner at Damon's restaurant. It has probably been 12 or 13 years since I've eaten at a Damon's restaurant, it was really good and the service was good too. Mark brought down three new Penguins game jerseys, a Jordan Staal and Sidney Crosby for me and a Sidney Crosby for my other friend Dave..... All in all a pretty full weekend and it's only Sunday morning. The Penguins play tonight at five and I'm already wearing my new white Jordan Staal jersey in anticipation..... lets go Pens Good morning blogosphere......... if any of you have children and are thinking forward to their careers let me make a suggestion. Do not encourage them to be a doctor or lawyer, the real money is in auto repair........ I had my van at my local accessibility dealer to have the lift repaired this week. I needed two toggle switches replaced. the two switch's cost $15 however the labor was two hours at $90 per hour........ imagine my surprise. Do not encourage your kids to go to graduate school or receive doctorates..... purchase them a socket set and a flashlight, put them on the road to financial security early........ $90 an hour damn. 'Theft' of Sidney Crosby's equipment solved I am glad to hear that Sidney Crosby's gear was found and will be returned to him. Hopefully it makes it into the hockey Hall of Fame where it belongs. It was 63Â° today and the snow has finally melted off most of the sidewalks. So I made it over to Starbucks and had tea this afternoon. It was so nice getting out of the house and enjoying the warmer weather. Maybe winter is finally over, after all it's almost St. Patrick's Day! I could sure go for a Guinness or two about now. The mayor of Pittsburgh has declared a state of emergency in advance of flooding. Hopefully people are prepared, Especially those in flood prone areas. The weather forecast is expecting rain the next few days on top of melting snows in the higher elevations..... The last few weeks I have been using my Netflix account to watch a ton of movies... plus the on-demand cable. Now that the weather is getting nicer I plan on being outside more as soon as the 1 foot of snow and ice melt off of my back deck.... Reebok Canada to pay for return of Crosby's equipment Reebok is offering a $10,000 reward for the no questions return of Sidney Crosby's Olympic gloves and hockey stick. After scoring the overtime goal to give team Canada the gold medal, Sidney dropped his gloves, hockey stick and mouthpiece in celebration. The only thing he got back was his mouthpiece........ Whoever has his equipment should just return it, do the right thing! It's a piece of Canadian history and I'm sure Crosby would like to have it back. BBC News - YouTube adds video captions for deaf Here is a great example of using technology to include individuals with disabilities. Using automatic speech recognition to provide close captioning for YouTube videos makes perfect sense. The technology may not be perfect, but at least it's a start! It would be great if all companies concentrated on inclusion and universal design, hopefully more companies follow Google's example. While watching last night's news I was surprised to see Steelers Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger under investigation again for sexual assault..... It's only been nine months since the last accusation of sexual assault in Nevada. I thought he would be much more cautious in his extra curricular activities. It seems Ben and a bunch of buddies hit several bars and nightclubs in Georgia, near his summer home. I think it's time Big Ben gets a steady girlfriend and forgets about clubbing and drinking with 20 year old girls.... Repeat after me Ben, I will not have sex with strange women in nightclub bathrooms.... your thoughts?
