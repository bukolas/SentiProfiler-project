Last night, and a few hours of this morning, were spent in the ER because we thought I might have appendicitis. But let me explain a little bit of what had been happening before-hand. A couple months ago my back started hurting, lower right hand side, really bad. It went away for a while, but then a couple weeks ago it came back, so my DI dr. put me on a lactose/gluten free diet. That seemed to help until Thursday. I threw up that night and my back and lower front side started hurting really bad. I was afraid to tell my mom about and decided to just not tell her for as long as I could bear it. Yeah...that lasted until about 11 AM the next morning [yesterday]. Last night Amanda was here and she was talking about my symptoms to my mom and looked them up on WebMD, and decided I should go to urgent care, just in case. We went, and he sent us to the ER with a note saying appendicitis needed to be ruled out. ...I think that pretty much sums up why we were there...
Hospitals are quite the learning environment. For reals. I wasn't scared about being diagnosed with something, so much as being sent home with another, "We don't know, we can't find anything wrong." I've been through that, a lot, and I *hate* it. I think the longest wait ever was waiting for the results of the CT scan. I prayed and prayed for God to give me peace, strength, and comfort. Finally I said to my mom, "I'm scared." I had brought my Bible along, in case I got lucky and it was appendicitis, and I would have to stay there. I have an insert in my Bible about God's mysterious side. I got that out and read this part of it:
