Outfitted with burly outsoles, waterproof materials, and big toe guards, trail shoes are built to bring you closer to nature. As the following reviews indicate, not every trail shoe is perfect for every off-road outing. Some are built low and feature sticky treads that grip mucky footpaths and shale-strewn climbs. Others have smaller treads and thicker cushioning more appropriate for less-rugged terrain. To determine how they measure up, we analyzed each shoe at the RW Shoe Lab and tested them on the feet of more than 200 runners. We found these nine shoes to be the best for tackling the trails. WE SAY This is one of the few trail shoes with enough cushioning to handle long stretches of road and still provide sure footing on loose terrain and mud, thanks to its deep lugs. It also features a grippy edge in the heel that helps maintain traction going downhill. RW Shoe Lab tests show the shoe's heel and forefoot to be among the softest in this guide. All this cushioning results in a bulkier-than average midsole that some testers felt lifted them too high off the ground. Recommended for trail runners who frequently mix in some roads and don't want to sacrifice off-road traction.

WEAR-TESTER SAYS "I liked the traction, but the heel felt high."—Jenna Druver, 32, East Lansing
"Meanwhile, the National Geographic Society has been funding Dr. Haile-Selassie since 2005 at a new research site called Woranso-Mille in the Afar depression of Ethiopia. There his team found 4 million-year-old hominins that may help clarify a transition that occurred after Ardipithecus, the transition from Australopithecus anamensis to Lucy's species, Au. afarensis. With his impressive track record for significant discoveries and research publications, there is one thing we can be sure of—we have not heard the last from Dr. Yohannes Haile-Selassie. Today the world will witness the long-awaited roll out of Ardipithecus ramidus. And what a roll out! This new member of the hominin lineage has features that are quite unexpected because they are unlike what we see in living great apes, which share common ancestry with humans. A whole issue of Science is devoted to this creature and the work of a dedicated group of scientists who spent many years in the desolate Middle Awash project area of the Afar depression in Ethiopia. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of the Middle Awash team members over the years. Among them are many Ethiopians who started their careers in the Middle Awash more than 15 years ago as bright, dedicated students. Now they are PhDs who are spread throughout the world at prestigious institutions making significant contributions to science, not the least of which are the many papers being announced today concerning the anatomy and environment of Ardipithecus ramidus. Buried in these scientific papers is a significant mention that may pass right by many readers. In the paper entiltled ""Ardipithecus ramidus and the Paleobiology of Early Hominids,"" the authors mention how in the early 1990s, after much looking, they were only finding scrappy bits of early human fossils at Aramis. They go on to say, however, that ""... on 5 November 1994, Y.H. S. collected two hominid metacarpal fragments (ARA-VP-6/5001a and b) from the surface of an exposed silty clay..."" Those hand bones were the first bits found of what would become the substance of much of today's press announcement—the most complete skeleton of an adult early hominin since the discovery of Lucy, the australopith, in 1974. Who is its discoverer, Y.H.S.? It was none other than Yohannes Haile-Selassie, one of the Ethiopian students I mentioned.

That was 1994. Now Haile-Selassie is well known in the paleoanthropological community for another discovery and report—that of Ardipithecus kadabba, a hominin that lived over one million years earlier than Ar. ramidus.  He and his colleagues first reported on this species in 2001 and a second report followed in 2004."
Off he heads, leaving behind his still-doting wife (Leslie Mann) in Texas, making for Miami where he falls for a handsome chap called Jimmy (Rodrigo Santoro) whom he showers with extravagant gifts he can’t afford. Eventually, the police catch up with him and he’s sent to jail where he falls even more madly for young, softly-spoken Phillip (Ewan McGregor).

They will, he vows, never be apart. Even if that means, upon being released, pretending to be a lawyer to get his lover out of jail, blagging a job as a high-ranking financial executive to fund an opulent life for the two of them, upon being sent back to jail conning medics that he’s dying of AIDS the better to effect an escape plan.

He’s outrageous.

Yet, unlike Matt Damon’s serial deceiver in The Informant!, he doesn’t seem sad or pitiable. If he’s a monster, he’s a charming one. Perhaps he’s in the grip of a compulsion. Perhaps his desire to be and do everything for Phillip marks him as a power freak.

It’s hard though not to envy his energy and guile. After all, when you love someone don’t you move heaven and earth to be and do everything for that person? This isn’t a satire or a cautionary tale: it’s one of the most romantic, most inspiring films of recent years.

What makes it especially arresting is its frankness. It’s more queer than gay, avoiding the tragic homosexual themes of Brokeback Mountain, the stylised melancholy of A Single Man, or the activist agenda of Milk. When Steve tells Phillip he’s taken up golf, his immediate response is: “Golf? You’re a homosexual!”

There are scenes that depict kissing, sweatiness, and post-fellatio banter into all of which Carrey and McGregor, though they don’t seem 100 per cent compatible, throw themselves whole-heartedly.

That whole-heartedness has its drawbacks. Carrey, in his best performance for a long time, still struggles to rein in his urge to over-gesticulate. And Steve’s ardour, his inability to stop fabulating, becomes wearying.

Phillip may well be a kind soul — though his character needs fleshing out — but it’s hard to imagine how, if they’d lived together for a long period, he could have put up with Steve’s hyper-ness. Then again, as this witty, engaging film proves, love has its own strange logic.  I Love You Phillip Morris begins with the opposite of a disclaimer. The words “This really happened” appear on the screen.

Then, just to make sure you know you’re in for one of the most batty and scarcely believable biopics of recent times, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who together wrote and directed the film, add: “It really did.” Steve Russell (played by Jim Carrey) is a conman who makes Bernie Madoff look small time. He joins the police force in order to get access to documents that will let him track down the mother who gave him up for adoption as a young child. He’s a church organist and a married father-of-two who, following a car crash, embraces fully a fact that that he’s always known: he’s gay.
"1973 - Pure expressive massing. This house's interior volumes strain the break free, pushing the facade to the limits of thinness. ""Ornament"" consists of the house's own volumes, and the interplay of glass with a couple of solid facing materials. Delightful, and it must surely be awash in natural light all day long.1977 - Everything about this house screams 1960s, from the vertical wood slats to the mixed-color brick, but it evidently came down the pike about ten years later than it looks. That front entry facade is pure art! 1983 - Again, my first guess was late 1960s, perhaps a facade tacked on to an older house. Well, the facade is certainly tacked on, but the house is surprisingly new. Given the date and the strangely pretentious front elevation, one is tempted to call it a PostModern work. A split driveway (surrounding a planted island!) descends to twin single-car garages, with stairs leading up to the main entrance. Miniature grandeur, or a house with its foundations washed out from under it? You be the judge! 1978 - Another fortress in concrete, but this one succeeds beyond all expectations. This elegant house raises the primary living spaces raised up above the ground - a strategy used 70 years earlier in Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House. Thirty years old now, but it could just as easily be brand new. I must apologize to my readers for the lack of postings lately, but you see, I've been busy getting married! Getting married (and its aftermath, and the preceding Christmas holidays) has involved a great deal of travel. Without further elaboration, have as a momentary filler some photos from my recent adventures in:
The North Shore, from Evanston on up to Winnetka, is an unbelievable assemblage of wealth. Mansion after mansion lines Sheridan Road as it winds its way up the lake. Compared to the urban hustle of Chicago just a few miles south, the area is unbelievably sylvan and tranquil.
The houses are pretty unbelievable, and there's quite a few of architectural interest, but for now, let's just enjoy the pretty colors, shall we?It's not a dazzling building, but its jumble of massing is intriguing. Each function of the building seems to have its own articulation, even its own facade material. And it's hard to fully judge a Modernist building when the windows are boarded over. The funeral home appears to have operated into 2002, before moving to a new location in Skokie. Since then it's been vacant and boarded up, with a developer planning ot turn the land into new residential development.
Given its former use, the odds of this little Midcentury piece surviving are pretty slim. As detailed in an article in Chicago Real Estate Daily, the economic slowdown is the only reason the building is still standing. Doomed along with it is this vacant turn of the century apartment house with retail in the base. I'm sure the would-be developers imagined a massive apartment/condo blockbuster building, similar to others that have gone up along other sections of Broadway in recent years. But with the scent of the money trail gone cold, couldn't some thought be given to finding a new use for this little slice of 1960s style? Much of the lot is empty land. A small outbuilding is the only structure on the northern half of this large city lot -- plenty of room for new and old to co-exist.

Is it time to throw Leo to the lions? The Beach, in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a backpacker in Thailand who thinks he has found a map to paradise, is going to piss off a lot of people just because he's in it. After his unprecedented Titanic splash two years ago, DiCaprio took a vacation from acting, presumably to party, but in the media he was a constant source of backlash-building fascination: all Leo, all the time. The Beach returns DiCaprio, 25, to the screen, not as the talented kid who held his own against Robert De Niro in 1993's This Boy's Life but as a Hollywood player with Titanic-size box-office clout.

DiCaprio received $20 million to play Richard in the film version of Alex Garland's 1996 cult novel about Gen X disillusionment. Wasn't Richard a Brit in the book? No problem - for Leo, you make him American. Wasn't it the plan of director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter John Hodge - the British team behind the indie hits Shallow Grave and Trainspotting -- to make a low-budget film? No problem -- for Leo, you spend $50 million. Wasn't actor Ewan McGregor -- the team player behind Shallow Grave and Trainspotting -- the first choice to play Richard? No problem -- for Leo, you make adjustments.


And so The Beach comes to the screen freighted with enough Leo baggage to make the movie seem beside the point. It isn't. The Beach, for all its lapses of judgment and failures of nerve, has its strong points. DiCaprio is one of them. His Richard is a pop-culture junkie, constantly pushing the video games he plays to the next level of difficulty and living his life the same way. Traveling alone in Thailand, he checks into a Bangkok flophouse, where the night sounds include a sexy French couple -- Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) -- and a suicidal Scot named Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rambles about a map to a perfect beach on a hidden island. The next day, Richard finds Daffy's bloody corpse and the map. Note: Daffy returns with a vengeance in dream sequences, one of which shows him and Richard gunning down tourists. Yikes.
Boston Rapper Edan dropped psych-hop classic Beauty and the Beat in 2005. So long ago, that alot of us thought dood was a done deal. The album was so layered and textured that maybe it was impossible to follow-up.
Luckily, Traffic Entertainment broke Edan off with their back catalog of early 80’s rap, disco, funk and punk records.
This gave Edan more than enough to obessess over.

Like normally some 80’s Hip Hop throwback would make me want to vomit on the nearest nerd wearing a Jurassic 5 shirt. But there is no corny staleness on this.
The best I can describe is like this: Imagine its 1979, Hip Hop is burgeoning but you still listen to Black Sabbath. One night you smoke dust before painting a Subway Car. Afterwords, Your painting partner invites you to a park jam in the South Bronx where doods are relaying all kinds of records and chanting wild shit over a p.a. You’re buzzed off the xylene in the paint, and the joy of just doing your name big. You are faded and amped at the same time. Although you’re bugged out a little, you’re a chill bachleour. Still a royal charmer; So thru all this you pull a flygirl in tight jeans while still feeling really wavy.

There is no rapping by Edan on this. Which is however you feel. Some people think his 88 Big Daddy Kane rhymestyles are hard. Some people think it shows that he doesn’t listen to enough Freeway or Joey Jihad.

Just blends, backmasks, distorts,clavichords, kazoo’s, pedals, flanges. Echo Party keeps a fun, pleasent disorientation throughout the mix.
When he doubles up the vintage rap chants, its some thing like this: “i got a new rap. it’s all about space. i got a new rap. it’s all about space.space space space space.” then will add some other old rap shit like, ‘the economy, sucks, everyone is terrible. do you want to stay here or go to outerspace?’
Anyway. The top video is a good sampling of what the mix about. The bottom video is Edan handmaking the covers for the vinyl of Echo Party
"By popular request in comment threads and emails, I'll be putting together a Saturday digest of election-oriented diaries from now until November. This project emerged from the Community Power! Election Season diary written Feb. 20. Next week I'll introduce you to a couple of other Kossacks who will be joining me in running the project. Each digest will include a list of election diaries published during the previous week and categorized by region. A separate section will include diaries written in the previous week by incumbents, new candidates and wannabe candidates. (Diaries by incumbents may or may not be directly related to the coming elections.) Digests will also focus on a few tips for making diaries more persuasive, informative and written in a way that encourages everyone to read them even if they live 2000 miles away from the spotlighted contest. This week, we're talking headlines. Just as with a story in a newspaper or magazine, a headline can make or break a diary. That is, you can attract an audience or drive it away by the words and structure you choose. Crafting great headlines is something even some of the best writers never quite get the knack of, but everybody can train themselves to become better at it. Too many writers spend hours on research and writing their diaries, then slap on a 30-second headline. Spend some time at it. A good practice is to write three or four possible headlines and choose the best one. Happily for bloggers, some of the old rules from the old media – like character counts – don't apply in wwwLand. But some do. Here are 10 guidelines to think about: Headlines are bait. Instill curiosity: ""Paternity Test Demanded for Florida Abstinence Campaigner""; ""Voters Eager to Punish Liberals, Selves"" Conversational headlines appeal to the most readers.
• Use the active voice. Good verbs work wonders. ""To be"" conjugations bore readers.
• There's power in humor, but serious stories suffer from overly cute headlines. Headlines with a twist of an old cliché reel in readers. But take care not to twist too far.
• Beware. Double entendres can help or hurt. ""Cops Pinch Lewd Nude"" works; however, ""Clinton Wins Budget; More Lies Ahead"" has problems.
• Be succinct. Short headlines are punchier and easier to read. Ernest Hemingway told a whole story once in six words - ""For sale: baby shoes, never used."" A helluva good headline, too.
• Match the headline to the story. Don't deceive. Nobody likes being taken for a fool. If the diary is about a candidate, the candidate's and/or district's name should usually appear in the headline. DON'T WRITE HEADLINES IN ALL CAPS. Besides ""shouting,"" they are hard to read. If it's not BREAKING! don't lie about it.
From this week's collection of election diaries, I've picked what I think are four solid headlines. But even most of them could be tweaked: Human trafficking, much of it for sexual purposes, is a worldwide phenomenon. It can be found everywhere from Vietnam to the United States. Estimates of its victims run from 4 million to 27 million, which numbers provide a window on how difficult

By now most of us have heard this story in one fashion or another: when Steve Jobs and Apple were in the planning stages of the iPhone, the first carrier they brought the device to was America's largest network, Verizon. Even if you haven't heard how the tale ends -- Verizon refused and Jobs took his multi-billion dollar ball to AT&T -- you surely know the outcome. The iPhone has soared to become the ultimate smartphone, the must-have accessory that everyone from celebrities to your mom wants -- nay, needs -- to have in their pocket. It's changed the landscape of modern cellphones, put a serious dent in the sales of competing devices (just recently overtaking the venerable RAZR as the best-selling domestic handset), and unquestionably raised the bar when it comes to expectations for features in new handsets.

It may seem unfair to open up the review of RIM's latest BlackBerry -- the Storm -- with a history lesson on the iPhone, but if you understand the market which Verizon and RIM hope to capture, then you understand the Storm, and it helps put this critique in perspective. The Storm, a widescreen, touchscreen device boasts many of the same features as the iPhone, but adds innovations like a clickable display, and comes packed with RIM's legendary email and messaging services. Mainlined into the biggest (and some say best) network in the States, the Storm is an almost deafening blast to the competition at first glance, but does it hold up on closer inspection? Read on to find out.
A few weeks ago a gentleman of, by his own account, more than average girth was thrown off a Southwest Air flight between Oakland and Burbank.

Unfortunately for the airline this was no ordinary gentleman but Kevin Smith, director of such classics as Clerks and Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and, perhaps more importantly, a man conversant with social media.

As he was unceremoniously removed from the flight because he was a “customer of size” and therefore a safety risk, he turned to twitter to vent his spleen.

The resulting fracas was what we in the nerdy world call a twitter storm. That is, one person is able to leverage the power of social networks to make a much bigger noise than would otherwise be the case.

Some commentators have suggested this is a new kind of customer: “a new kind of uglry customer who isn't always right but insists on his right to share his feelings with us and his right to be heard”, as one Singaporean travel industry insider put it.

Of course, this isn’t the case. There have always been Kevin Smiths, it’s just they have not been able to convey their disquiet so effectively. Now they have, at their fingertips, the ability to express and disseminate their feelings.

I’m a Kevin Smith. We’re all Kevin Smiths. We’re all capable of knowing when we’ve been discriminated against—not, in this case, because of his girth but because he was not told before he got on the plane, or when he bought his ticket, that he wouldn’t be able to fly.

We’re all Kevin Smiths, and we’ve all got the tools of Kevin Smith. Perhaps not the colorful turns of phrase, but the means.

Now I’m not blaming Southwest here, at least at the corporate level. Actually they did all the standard things to try to put out this blaze. They tried to reach him by email, by phone, and then publicly by twitter, to apologize.

They blogged about it, about their policy and the lessons learned.

But their failure was to understand that information travels much faster now. So in the crucial hours—no, minutes—after Kevin Smith was dumped off the flight there was a chance to turn all this around.
If you somehow held off on buying a Core i7 rig as soon as they popped out last year, you're in luck -- and your poor Pentium II system is flat out of it. Just about everyone has updated their gaming desktop lines this week with an option to splurge on Intel's 3.33GHz (or more) Core i7-980X Extreme Edition processor, and iBuyPower is no different. Said PC builder is now offering the chip within four of its Paladin desktops, and given that the stock clock speed is far too sluggish for your own greedy self, the Paladin XLC V3 ships in an overclocked configuration that promises a 30 percent boost in performance over the stock silicon. The rigs also ship with 6GB or 12GB of DDR3 memory, the latest and greatest ATI / NVIDIA graphics cards, an optional Blu-ray burner and a fresh copy of Windows 7. The lowest-end rig gets going at $2,159, while the aforesaid XLC V3 will set you back $4,409; the whole gang is available to customize as we speak.
Rolling out next-generation wireless networks can be painstakingly slow and patchy at the best of times, as the U.S. deployment of 3G has shown. But IBM researchers in China reckon that shifting the signal-processing requirements from base stations into the cloud will make it cheaper and easier to upgrade networks. Ultimately, the approach could lead to wireless networks that can provide better coverage by rapidly adapting to user demand. A new architecture called the Wireless Network Cloud (WNC) marks a step away from using dedicated hardware in the radio base stations that serve wireless networks like GSM and 3G cell phone networks, says Ling Shao, senior manager of System Software and Appliances at IBM's China Research Lab, in Beijing. With WNC, the radio antennas are physically decoupled from the base stations, with the latter existing virtually, within general-purpose data centers at distant locations. All of the signal processing--the modulation and encoding of the signals to and from the physical antennas--is carried out using software radio technology, adds Yonghua Lin, manager of IBM's Next Generation Network Appliance. With multicore and multithreading techniques, it is possible to use general-purpose data centers to carry out the signal processing entirely in software, she says.
Poor Microsoft — they must be wondering when it’s all going to end. Their browser choice screen was launched on 1 March following costly EU legal shenanigans. Statisticians then reported that the random browser display was not as random as it could be. Now the makers of Avant, Flock, GreenBrowser, K-meleon, Maxthon, Sleipnir and Slim have complained to the EU about the visibility of their browsers.

The vendors state that it’s not immediately obvious there are further browser choices beyond the initial five displayed on the choice screen: Microsoft has reiterated that the screen was in built in accordance with the European Commission’s demands.

In my opinion, no vendor will ever be 100% happy with the screen — even if Microsoft succumb to their wishes. Offering 12 browsers is slightly ridiculous and few novices will appreciate such an overwhelming choice.

What’s worse is that several of these applications have been rated as “shockingly low quality” in a recent PC Pro review. With the possible exception of Flock and Sleipner, many users could abandon their new slow and ugly browser, return to IE, and never try another alternative. That’s not what the EU wanted to achieve.

At least the top 5 browsers give users a choice of good-quality software which has been tried and tested by millions. The alternatives may have good points, but they’re less popular for a reason — and they do not offer the same level of support.

The horizontal scroll bar may not be good design, but it’s a reasonable compromise between offering everything and keeping the screen simple. I’m not convinced it should change. Are you?
The Plymouth County district attorney's office has found that selectmen in Rockland, Mass., violated the open meeting law in the process of hiring a full-time accountant, The Patriot Ledger reports. A town accountant search committee also violated the law. On Beacon Hill and in municipal buildings across the state, government officials are getting the message that e-mail can be a double-edged sword, writes State House reporter Dan Ring in The Republican of Springfield. "The state's Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of governmental boards and committees be conducted in sessions open to the public, with few exceptions which are strictly limited. The goal of the law is to eliminate as much of the secrecy around discussions and decisions of public policy, by requiring that discussion to be done in a public meeting.

"Amendments to the Open Meeting Law have been made many times since it was first adopted in 1958, most recently last July when Gov. Deval Patrick signed the ethics, lobbying and campaign finance reform bill that included changes to the Open Meeting Law. The changes, some of which are substantial, are scheduled to go into effect July 1." A former Superior Court judge in the U.S. Virgin Islands won a $240,000 libel verdict this week against the Virgin Islands Daily News. The former judge, Leon Kendall, was represented in the lawsuit by Howard Cooper, the Boston lawyer who in 2005 won a $2.1 million verdict against The Boston Herald for former Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Ernest Murphy.
Simply put, that was because throughout the Nineties websites had been straining at a technological leash – more sophisticated purposes, whether that meant using the web to handle email itself or just more advanced websites, were not possible with dial-up. What ADSL achieved was to utilise frequencies available within old copper wires that were not required for voice transmissions; plugging in “microfilters” to each home phone socket meant that that the two channels were effectively split into separate lines, catering to data and calls respectively. The line is asymmetric because download speeds are greater than upload speeds. Although not ideal for every purpose, that does make relatively passive, consumer browsing much more possible.

The history of the web’s development has shaped the internet, too: video conferencing, for instance, was hailed as the 'next big thing’, but simply wouldn’t work without higher upload rates. And websites have looked as they do – usually static – because the premium was on how much data would fit down each pipe. That history of pre-broadband internet continues to shape many of the websites we have today.

But as broadband access was rolled slowly out across the country, its limitations have become clearer – ideally, it only runs up to two miles from an exchange, although five is possible. And as technology has fostered cleverer websites, the need for better broadband has led to the so-called “digital divide” between the haves and the have nots.

Next week, we’ll look at the state of the broadband nation.
Expressed briefly, making a great wine is rather quite simple. You find the right piece of ground; you put the right grapes in; you tend them well and harvest them at the right time; and then you smash them together and nudge the product gently away from its tendency towards vinegar.

For some people, the most important step is finding the right piece of ground, and for anyone looking to start a winery, it is certainly the first step. It's really important. If you get it wrong, the rest of the stuff doesn't matter.

At least, that's the way that winemaker Robert Brittan approached it when he packed his brittan_logo.gifbags and closed the chapter of his life that might have been entitled Man Meets Cabernet: 25 Years in Napa.

Brittan first started making wine for the same reason many do: to get chicks. He was a physics major at Oregon State University, and like many in the same situation, he couldn't get a date. But one day he noticed that the guys across the hall had removed all of their furniture and replaced their couches and chairs with two important items: a Harley Davidson motorcycle and a still. They'd brew a batch of whiskey during the week, and on the weekends their room would be crawling with girls.

Brittan couldn't afford to compete with free everclear and a Harley, but the envious and enterprising young man thought he might just do one better by going highbrow: he would make wine instead. So Brittan got a 2.5 gallon glass demijohn and started fermenting everything he could get his hands on, wrapping his electric blanket around the jug to keep the fermentation going. And wouldn't you know it, the first time he actually managed to make something drinkable, he got a date.

Of course, then he had to take it to the next level. Thinking that if he made better wine, he might get better dates, Brittan took a job for a harvest in California's Central Valley, and not only learned a thing or two about how to make real wine, but discovered, as he puts it, "an entire lifestyle that I immediately knew I wanted."

It was 1974, and California wine was at an inflection point in its growth that would forever change the state, the country, and even the world. Some of the legendary winemakers of Napa were still plying their craft, and people like Robert Mondavi were busy convincing a generation of Americans to drink wine instead of martinis.

"It was just an exciting time to be in the wine business," says Brittan. "There was the whole science aspect of it that appealed to my monkey mind, and then the creative component that felt very artistic, and then there was this lifestyle -- a way of living that wasn't about getting rich, but was about living really well."

Brittan enrolled in U.C. Davis, and upon graduating, began his career as a winemaker, eventually ending up at St. Andrew's winery at the very southern end of the Silverado Trail in Napa. When the winery was sold, Brittan agreed to stay on for the new owner, but his heart wasn't in it. Brittan had passing fantasies of heading back north to Oregon. But then what was just going to be a casual conversation with Carl Doumani about a new vineyard that he had acquired turned into a job offer and a 16-year stint as the winemaker for Stag's Leap Winery.

But after those 16 years, Brittan found himself wanting a new challenge, and decided that he wanted to try his hand at Pinot Noir, a grape that he had flirted briefly with in his career, but never fully explored.

So in 2004, after looking as far afield as France and California's Central Coast Brittan and his wife Ellen returned to Oregon and fell in love with a windy, overgrown knoll in the McMinnville AVA (American Viticultural Area) of the Willamette Valley. There Brittan found an exposed, cold 128 acres with nutrient-poor soils that he thought would be perfect for Pinot Noir. An 18-acre vineyard had been planted, but only about nine acres was still alive and salvageable. Coddled, nurtured, and coaxed, those nine acres yielded their first wine in 2006.

The grapes are picked when Brittan thinks they're ready. He believes in the concept of physiological ripeness, but is quick to admit that the phrase has been used to the point of cliché. He tastes, and when they taste ripe, he picks. Simple as that. The fact that his grapes are lower in sugar when he picks (compared to most of his neighbors) he simply chalks up to having found "the right piece of ground." The grapes are crushed and given a five-day cold soak before fermentation is started. After the wines have fermented dry they are racked into French oak barrels, of which roughly 35% are new, and aged for approximately 9 months following the completion of a secondary fermentation.
Cardigans are another wardrobe must have. And they have had a bit of a comeback lately too, not that they ever really went out of style but more and more designers seem to have them in their collections. Cardigans are great if you aren't a sport jacket kind of guy or if you are feeling more casual. They are perfect for transitional weather like in spring. They come in so many styles from slim fitting and modern to more traditional. There is nothing like the feel of cashmere. And when mixed with cotton, it's equally as soft but much less expensive. This cardigan has a modern cut with a few modern touches like the contrast trim and elbow patches. This is the type cardigan that both you or your dad could wear. It's just a matter of how you wear it. I love the color. What a great cardigan to wear with jeans. Although it's a bit of a splurge, it's the kind of piece that you would could wear year round. If you are fan of argyle patterns, then you may like this cardigan. It's definitely more interesting than your average cardigan. This cardigan is definitely versatile and so soft. You could wear this with jeans and a tee or with dress pants and a button-down shirt. I am a big fan of Banana Republic for bringing us designer looks for less.
Last night the airline, which employs a total of 13,500 cabin crew, was rescheduling some long-haul and short-haul flights which it had expected to have to cancel over the next two days of the strike, organised by Unite.

The union, which has 12,000 BA cabin crew members, hit back last night and also claimed a resounding success for its first day of industrial action and it insisted BA's contingency plans had failed.

The union said 80 per cent of its members had stood firm and that the airline had only been able to fly a third of its intended flights. It said that flight cancellations meant that 85 BA planes were parked inactively at Heathrow and a further 20 aircraft were parked at both Cardiff and Shannon airports.

Despite persistent rumours that secret talks were under way yesterday in an attempt to break the deadlock, both sides insisted that had been no fresh new negotiations and that none were planned.

The strike, the first by BA cabin crew in 13 years, went ahead after talks over pay and conditions ended in deadlock on Friday. A second wave of industrial action is scheduled for next weekend.

As the war of words escalated between the two sides yesterday, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the airline, described the strike as a "terrible day" for BA. However, the company insisted: "We continue to offer the fullest support to our cabin crew who want to work as normal."

BA predicts that 65 per cent of passengers will still be able to reach their destination during the first three-day strike, even though a total of 1,100 flights out of the 1,950 scheduled to operate are expected to be cancelled.

BA has arranged with more than 60 other airlines to take its customers on their flights during the strike.

Tony Woodley, Unite's joint leader, accused BA of wanting a "war" with the union and complained that Mr Walsh had tabled a worse offer than the one withdrawn earlier.

Mr Woodley said that he had been set "mission impossible" because of the new offer, which included a four-year pay deal the union maintained would at best freeze wages until 2014.

It can be revealed that some female cabin staff braved the threat of intimidation by union workers to go to work as normal yesterday.

Some of those who worked had received threatening emails on Friday night, one of which read: "If any of you go into work tomorrow, your life won't be worth living.''

A strikebreaker, who asked to be known only as Suzy for fear of recriminations, admitted she was terrified by the prospect of turning up for work as a volunteer.

"My stomach is churning. I don't know what I'm going to face. I just know I am going to be on board that plane, reassuring passengers, sorting out the seating, the food. Doing my job,'' she said.

"Usually workers – quite rightly – fear not doing what the boss asks. But we are just as frightened not to do what the union asks.''

Some cabin crew had to pass through picket lines to get to work, but there were no reports of violence. Tall screens were erected outside the crew report centre at Heathrow to protect volunteer staff from intimidation.

On the picket lines along the airport's Perimeter Road yesterday, union members shouted "shame on you, shame on you", at staff buses carrying those cabin crews who had decided to defy the strikes.

Some of the strikebreakers hid their identity by crouching on the floor of the buses taking them in.

There was little chaos at the major airports because most passengers had learnt in advance, by email, text or telephone, that their flights were cancelled and that they should not turn up.

Those who did were relatively relaxed. Bryan Collins, 21, a student hoping to fly from Heathrow's Terminal 5, said: "I checked this morning and they said 60 per cent of customers would be flying today so I guess we should be OK."

According to an opinion poll carried out in the days before the walkout, only one in four supports the action.

A survey by ICM, for BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, found 60 per cent believed the industrial action was "unjustified", with 25 per cent expressing support.

The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent) believed it was "unacceptable in today's society" for workers to have the right to walk out at all.

This newspaper has learnt that Unite plotted with foreign unions to target BA before its members had even voted for industrial action.

Union leaders briefed their overseas counterparts as early as November, urging them to lend support to its plans to ground BA flights.

Len McCluskey, Unite's assistant general secretary, told hundreds of strikers at a rally near Heathrow yesterday that "intransigent management" could be defeated.

"Decent men and women are terrified about speaking out about this fight for their futures for fear of reprisals," he said.

There was political in-fighting yesterday over the strike.

The Prime Minister has urged the two sides to resolve the dispute, but David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, yesterday accused Gordon Brown of failing to act because Unite is "bankrolling" the Labour Party.

Mr Cameron said the strike threatened the very future of one of the UK's "greatest companies".

Addressing supporters in Putney, south-west London, he said: "This threatens the future of one of Britain's greatest companies along with thousands of jobs.

The Tories sent a mobile advertising truck to the area around the airport carrying a poster portraying the Prime Minister in an airline uniform with Unite logos and the slogan: "Gordon's doing sweet BA – is it because he's taken £11m of Unite's cash?"
TV's master chef Jacques Pépin has gone from La Technique to le fast food.
By Bruce Cole. Published February 2005. © 7x7 Magazine/Hartle Media. All rights reserved.

If, when cleaning a leek or dismembering a chicken, you hear a distinctive, French-accented voice in your head telling you precisely what to do next, don't be alarmed. It's just Jacques Pépin-or, rather, one of his many tips you've absorbed from years of watching him on TV-floating to the surface. Starting in 1991 with Today's Gourmet, he's hosted 11 series for KQED; his latest, Fast Food My Way, premiered in October 2004. But the 69-year-old Pépin is also quite the Renaissance man (with an MA in French lit from Columbia University, no less) who, despite his Gallic upbringing and heritage, has an astute take on today's American culture-as we found out when we spoke to him by phone from his home in Connecticut.

Foie gras has been in the news, especially here in California, where a law was just passed to ban, eventually, its production. What do you think of all the hoopla?
It's a tempest in a teacup, you know. Most of the people against foie gras have never even been on a farm. If it was traumatizing in any way, it would do a lot of damage to the animal and to the liver, which would make in inedible. If you want to talk about torturing animas, go see the way they raise chickens. They blind them and cut off their beaks so they can't fight. The noise in a factory chicken farm is atrocious-this is why eggs have such a high level of cholesterol. They found out years ago that putting acoustic tiles in the room to lower the noise cut the cholesterol level by 10 to 15 percent.

You've been a proponent of sustainable cuisine-have you ever considered doing a cookbook or a TV show that features sustainable methods of raising food?
No, because for me that is just part of the equation. I use organic food when I can, but I'm not going to stop eating when there isn't any. I would have an argument with Alice [Waters] because if an ingredient is not organic, she doesn't want it. Me, I'll take a tomato if it's an extraordinary tomato, even if it's not organic, over an organic tomato that has no taste whatever. People think that because [something's] organic, it's extraordinary. I've had lousy organic food.

For years you've taught at the French Culinary Institute in New York and at Boston University. Are students these days more concerned with fame and fortune than with just learning the basics?
Oh, yes-probably one out of two are at school because they want to be a celebrity chef. They will come in for an interview and say, “Well, I'd like to do a book like you and a television show like you, so who do you think I should call?” like there is some secret number. It still gives me a shot in the arm, though, to work with students.
An interesting juxtaposition of articles in the Arts section of the Times this morning. Emory has made some of Salmen Rushdie's papers available, including the original Mac machines on which he wrote, and there is an interesting discussion of the difficulties of preserving "born digital" materials. Like most archives, our own Archives & Special Collections has not begun to tackle this yet, too expensive, not enough standards, etc.

The second article concerns C-Span placing their video archive on the web. You can find the archive here. This is not about preservation, but all about access, and what incredible access. This is going straight on my politics libguide. But C-Span is actually archived at the Research Park at Purdue.  Barbara Fister, of Gustavus Adolphus, has written her usual thoughtful comments about the latest controversy concerning how we can use and sustain large shared bibliographic databases. My major concern here is how we can enable the maximum sharing and reuse of data while enabling such organizations as OCLC just enough control so that they have an incentive to continue to do the great work that we have seen over the last forty years.   Unfortunately, when I look for my daily commute, it takes me through a gated reserve that would be lovely, but illegal. The real route slightly shorter and goes along Mizell, and east, not west of Lake Mizell. But Google Maps won't let me change it, because I take a pathway, not a road for a 20 feet of the route and I bike aacross campus, not around it.

C'est la vie!  Well this is sad news. The best local independent bookstore is closing. I suppose this is a sign of the times, but is a bad sign all the same. I enjoyed riding my bike down the Cady Way Trail, around the mall, and through Thorton Park to the bookstore. I guess I just didn't do it often enough. Last time I went, in February, I bought Fernando Baez's A Universal History of the Destruction of the Book: From Ancient Sumer to Modern Iraq. But since then I have bought at least two books (new and used) on Amazon. Pogo was right, "we have met the enemy and they is us."
Until now, most of the art to come out of September 11 has been targeted to adults. A lot of it has tried to give us "closure," to explain what happened to us because of the attacks. A reoccurring theme—from Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close  to Don DeLillo's Falling Man—is the difficult road to healing. If there's a literary equivalent to Remember Me, it's Claire Messud's 2006 novel The Emperor’s Children, another story about how young, spoiled, 20-somethings are affected by the suddenness of September 11, which ends the novel. But in that case, the introduction of September 11 felt over the top, like an escape from resolution rather than a natural ending point. It just didn't feel real.

That's not the case with Remember Me, which makes us grieve all over again. It shows us that no matter how horrible that day was, it should never be erased. In the immediate aftermath, it was wiped from the skyline of Spider-Manand the coffee talk on Friends. Now we have the biggest star in the tween world building a memorial dedicated to September 11. When it's taught in classrooms, September 11 is presented as a historical atrocity. The key word: historical. For those who weren't old enough to pick up The New York Times in the days that followed (like the screenplay writer of the movie, who found his inspiration in the paper's mini-obituaries of the victims of that day), the faces of the men and women who perished are simply relics from the past. Remember Me exposes a new generation to what happened in American nearly—can you believe it?—a decade ago. The title isn't a request. It's a command.
As an English major, I'm a big believer in the idea that great books require a reader's participation. A book isn't finished until the corners are dog-eared, the margins are crammed with notes, and all the juicy quotes get underlined. When it comes to textbooks in particular, the ability to annotate text is downright necessary.

If e-books are the future of literature, e-book readers need to become just as capable of annotation and markup as their paper-printed ancestors. At least, that's the driving philosophy behind the Entourage Edge, a combination e-book reader and tablet computer that is leading the charge toward making e-book text as easy to mark, quote, and dog-ear as the real thing.

Unfortunately, though the concept is lofty, the device has a ways to go before the Kindle and Nook crowd will take notice.

Design
As a first-generation product from a new company, the Edge is a surprisingly sturdy and feature-packed device. It's also an awkward, sprawling mess.

Blame it on the times we live in, but so far, no one has been able to invent a unified touch-screen technology that combines the readability and low power consumption of electronic ink displays (used on products such as the Amazon Kindle and Sony Reader) with the vibrant colored, illuminated LCD screens necessary for even modest Web browsing or media playback. Unwilling to compromise between a quality reading experience and a quality Web and media experience, the Entourage Edge literally links together a 9.7-inch e-ink display (a Wacom touch screen), and a 10.1-inch color LCD (resistive touch screen), and assigns each screen the tasks to which they are best suited.
It is Christmas Day, 2009. This is the first Christmas that I have not had any contact with my parents. As some of you know, my dad died last year in September, but I still had contact with my mom. This past September my siblings felt that it was in Mom's best interest to move her into an assisted living facility.

I know that her memory was not the best, but I am not sure if it is only the short term memory. At this point my only point of contact is with my brother and he has only written to me once in the thirteen years I have been in prison, and that letter came in October of this year telling me that he had moved mom into the assisted living facility and was only writing to me because Mom told him to.

He did not tell me the address of where our mother is, saying that he would bring any letters and cards I sent to her when he went to visit her. I sent out a letter to him, including one to Mom, on November 1, and since then I have not heard anything.

This is one of the most vexing problems for a lot of people in prison: contact with family members. There is often a lot of tension, bad feelings and emotional confusion when a member of the family ends up in prison. Sometimes it is seen as a badge of honor. Sometimes there is a sense of gratitude that an out of control family member is getting the "help" he or she needs.

At the recent Residents Encounter Christ weekend we heard from one mother whose son was suffering from drug addiction. Since being incarcerated, he has turned his whole life around, taking every program he can get into, including college classes. His mom told us, with tears in her eyes, she is so grateful to have her son back. Even though he is still incarcerated!

That is one of the rarer success stories. It is not always the case where parents and other family members are willing (or able) to provide the very much needed emotional support for an incarcerated family member. While it is true that all our needs are supposed to be supplied by our keepers, reality presents a much different picture.

Up until this past September, I have been blessed with parents that have supported me both financially and emotionally throughout my journey as an incarcerated person. It is really up to family and friends to provide the emotional and other support that an individual needs.

Yes, we are all provided "three hots and a cot." But there is no way any system can provide all an individual needs. That is exactly the problem. Individual needs. The very words "individual needs" would be tough to put into the same sentence with the word system.

It is my opinion, backed by thirteen plus years on the inside, that one of the most common holes in an inmate's life is having his or her individual needs met. A lot of the time the problem is compounded by an inmate not even knowing what his needs are. I suppose a definition of the word need is in order.
Not long after Amazon updated the U.S.-only version of the Kindle and replaced it with a new international Kindle model, the company followed suit with the larger Kindle DX. This new model--now called the "Kindle DX (Global Wireless)"--runs on AT&T's network and can access content on cellular networks inside and outside of the U.S.

Aside from the switch in wireless carriers (the old DX used to be powered by Sprint, and didn't work outside the U.S.), nothing else has visibly changed--at least as far as the hardware itself goes. The 0.38-inch-deep DX is just a tad thicker than the 0.36-inch Kindle. And the Kindle DX's 9.7-inch e-ink display (1,200-by-824-pixel resolution) technically offers 2.5 times more screen real estate than the Kindle's 6-inch display. That extra screen comes at a price, both figuratively and literally, as the DX weighs almost twice as much (18.9 ounces) as the Kindle and costs $230 more, at $489.

Aside from the price, the biggest strike against the DX is a competing product from Apple. In early 2010, Apple announced that it would release the iPad, which offers a full-color capacitive touch screen that's the same size as the Kindle's monochrome e-ink screen along with a far richer feature set, including much better support for PDF and image files (the iPad also supports video playback, Web browsing, and iPhone apps).
Did you ever want to resize a video on the fly, scaling it as you would an image? Using intrinsic ratios for video, you can. This technique allows browsers to determine video dimensions based on the width of their containing block. With intrinsic dimensions, a new width triggers a new height calculation, allowing videos to resize and giving them the ability to scale the same way images do. See example one.
The concept

The idea is to create a box with the proper ratio (4:3, 16:9, etc.), then make the video inside that box stretch to fit the dimensions of the box. It’s that simple.
The trick

The padding property is the magic that styles a box with an intrinsic ratio. This is because we’ll set padding in a percentage, based on the width of the containing block.

The CSS rules below illustrate how to style the parent and child to create a “magic wrapper”—a container that proportionally resizes itself depending on the width of its parent. See example two. Let’s review the declarations in each rule, starting with .wrapper-with-intrinsic-ratio.

position: relative
    By declaring position: relative all child elements will position themselves in relation to this container.
padding-bottom: 20%
    This declaration gives the box a specific format. Using 20% for padding makes the height of the box equal to 20% of its width.
    We specifically chose to use padding-bottom rather than padding-top. This is because IE5 removes the “space” created via padding-top from the flow. In other words, using padding-top: 20% would create the layout we want, but the box would act like an absolutely positioned element, overlapping the next elements in the flow.
height: 0
    Specifying a height of 0 gives this element “layout” so that IE5 and IE6 will dimension the inner box properly. To learn more, visit “On having layout.”
    Note: because IE5 and IE6 treat width as a minimum width, you should not use width: 100% as a layout trigger. This causes the box to expand to fill its container rather than respect the width we set for that container. 

Now, let’s consider each declaration within our .element-to-stretch rule. Let's take a closer look at our new selectors and declarations, starting with the #containingBlock selector.

width: 50%
    This is just a wrapper to demonstrate resizing the video based on the viewport width. In the previous example, the containing block was the body element.

Now, let’s examine a couple of the declarations under the .videoWrapper selector.

padding-bottom: 56.25%
    To create a 16:9 ratio, we must divide 9 by 16 (0.5625 or 56.25%).
padding-top: 25px
    To avoid issues with the broken box model (IE5 or IE6 in quirks mode), we use padding-top rather than height to create room for the chrome.

Finally, we use the object, embed selector because, while some browsers rely on object (e.g., Safari), others need embed (e.g., Firefox).

Note: I’m using YouTube’s markup for now, but at the end of this article I’ll be using valid markup and dropping embed.
"Designing a graphic is like writing a story. You can't include all your material, nor can you present it with uniform emphasis. To engage readers, you have to selectively edit and then order your information into a narrative. In other words, what is most important for people to see and in what order? Not every reader will agree with our choices. Our health care graphic from the January issue (left, click to enlarge) has provoked a healthy debate around the blogosphere. Some people love it; others loathe it. The issue isn't just premiums or public options. Many bloggers are talking about our process.
There's nothing wrong with a scatter-plot solution. It just emphasizes different points—a different story. Here's why I didn't go this route. 1) Many people have difficulty reading scatter plots. When we produce graphics for our magazine, we consider a wide audience, many of whose members are not versed in visualization techniques. For most people, it's considerably easier to understand an upward or downward line than relative spatial positioning.
2) This graphic was designed for our vertical printed page (top). Scatter plots tend to work better as horizontals. Without this context, I can see why online viewers would question the graphic's shape. 3) Any data visualization is going to put certain information in the foreground and other info in the background. The scatter plot nicely organizes the countries into three clusters, but the varying dot size puts too much emphasis on the doctor-visit data, which should be a tertiary point. On the other hand, our parallel plot (which I anchored around the spending and life-expectancy averages) calls the reader's attention to discrepancies between spending and life expectancy—the story I wanted to tell. I applaud people for questioning our approach; in fact, I love this kind of dialogue—especially about art and design. Whether we reach consensus, well ... that's a different story. At least one blogger said we should have used a graph known as a scatter plot. A scatter plot lets you visualize the relationship between multiple variables. In the case of the health care graphic, our variables are spending, life expectancy, and doctor visits. The scatter-plot version (below) plots spending along the x axis and life expectancy along the y, and it uses dot size to show the doctor visits.There's nothing wrong with a scatter-plot solution.

"The musicians haven't left yet, but they do their shows in El Paso now," says Alfonso Quiñones, a Juárez concert promoter who is trying to organize a jazz festival in the city.

No solid number exists for the exodus, a matter of debate among Juárez's leaders. But the city's planning department estimates 116,000 homes are now abandoned. Measured against the average household size of the last census, the population who inhabited the empty homes alone could be as high as 400,000 people, representing one-third of the city before the violence began.

That would mark one of Mexico's largest single exoduses in decades.

"The problem is that we don't have the rule of law here," says Lucinda Vargas, an economist who runs a civic group called Plan Estratégico de Juárez.

Juárez finds itself in the crossfire between two rival drug gangs, the local Juárez cartel and the powerful Sinaloa cartel, both of whom want to control the city to smuggle drugs into the U.S., the world's biggest drug-consuming market, and capture a lucrative and growing local drug market.

In 2008, roughly 1,600 people were killed here, up from a few hundred annually in previous years. President Felipe Calderón decided to send federal police and some 7,000 troops to quell the dispute. The move hasn't worked: Last year, the death toll reached 2,600 people, making it Mexico's most violent city. There have been an estimated 500 homicides this year.

The latest high-profile blow to the city came on March 13, when three people associated with the U.S. Consulate in Juárez were gunned down in an incident that drew outrage from presidents on both side of the border.

Juárez isn't alone in its troubles with drug gangs, which operate with near complete impunity in much of northern and western Mexico. On Friday, residents of Mexico's northern business capital, Monterrey, awoke to nightmarish traffic after heavily armed men believed to be linked to drug gangs commandeered several trucks and buses and used them to block eight strategic traffic points around the city.
The Daily Examiner has served up a tasty slice of the local snarkosphere ever since A.J. Daulerio started blogging for the Philadelphia Magazine site one year ago. It was smart, smart-assed and featured, more than anything, good reporting and writing as he developed into a wise guide to what people were typing in these parts.

He came from Deadspin. He returns to Deadspin. Which is good, because his bio could not accomodate the names of any more publications .. Maxim, Gawker, Knot, the Black Table, Huffington Post, Deadspin, Oddjack, Deadspin (he likes Deadspin). Today's his last day. He gets to continue to live in his parent's gargage. Someone trawling Philly.com for bias at 9:50 this morning might have jumped to the wrong conclusion, seeing the promotional space for blogs.

The big damned fish we're talking about wasn't Bill Clinton.

It referred to the picture that had been there, of a giant striped bass plucked from the Schuylkill.

Maybe it's that the pictures and the display copy update at slightly different paces on the home page, so this was just a momentary thing. We love Bill around here, you know? This was nothing like "Mush From The Wimp."
Because I'm quite anal, I will have packed on Thursday night. So, after Strictly, I put my bags in the car and I'm off. My dog, Peggy, is a Shih Tzu cross. She's also a cross Shih Tzu. She tends to bark. She doesn't like men or other dogs.

I go south to a cottage I rent by the sea that's quiet and remote. On my perfect weekend, all food officially contains no calories. So at the Wandsworth roundabout drive-through, I make one of my bi-annual visits to McDonald's, wearing a cap pulled low in case friends or family see me.

After supper, I put a musical on. My current favourite is Annie. I perform all the parts as I drive down the motorway.

When I get there, the first thing I do is look at the stars. I love spaces and views. I get very claustrophobic in London. My muscles relax and my shoulders drop as I, literally and metaphorically, count my lucky stars.

There's nobody else there, which might sound odd for a single woman. Most single women I know are pining for a boyfriend or husband, but I love being on my own.

But I chat to Peggy like a mad eccentric. I've always been old before my time. So I'll also be in bed before 10.

Fully refreshed after 10 hours of sleep, I'm ready for a hearty breakfast at a local café. Next, I lie on my back, and breathe out all the week's stresses with the Alexander Technique.

Feeling very aligned, I go for a lovely cliff-top walk to "blow the cobwebs away", as my mother would say.

Then I take a picnic aboard a little rented put-put boat on an inlet like Itchenor and pootle about. I like watching birdwatchers because they're seriously tense and they love cagoules unashamedly. Afterwards I feel I deserve a proper post-boating British tea: scone, a cup of tea and cream and jam. Just heaven.

On Sunday, it would be a light cereal breakfast. Special K is a massive treat. Cereal has so much sugar in it.

Then a lovely walk to a pub for Sunday lunch, because there's nothing better than Yorkshire pudding. On the way, I'll visit a house where a writer used to live for inspiration.

I'd head back early to miss the traffic, put a wash on and get ready for the week before watching a film. I find writing stressful, so when I've had a wonderful weekend like this I want it to go on forever.
I am sorry guys, but I was wrong. I thought with the release of Trenches on YouTube and other sites that it would be available for our overseas viewers. I was wrong, but I am told Crackle is looking into foreign rights. Sorry, I guess you can do a PSP or something maybe. OK .. I know a lot of you viewers are overseas and not in the US and Crackle only has release rights in the states. You have been asking when can I see Trenches? Well you can watch the episodes now on YouTube!

Yep, so go get your Trenches fix on and I hope you guys enjoy it!
Go share it and comment all over.

Here are all 10 Episodes which you can of course embed and share on your websites and solcial networks.
With a surprising win in Saturday's 1,500 meters, speedskater Jonathan Kuck of Champaign moved into the overall lead after three of the four races at the World All-Around Championships in Heerenveen, the Netherlands.

Kuck, 20, a University of Illinois junior, is unlikely to hold that lead over reigning all-around champion Sven Kramer of the Netherlands after the final race, Sunday's 10,000 meters, in which Kuck finished 8th at the 2010 Olympics.

But, given his strong performance in Friday's 5,000, where Kuck finished fourth to the victorious Kramer, he should have a good chance at a medal.  

Kuck, who won a silver medal in team pursuit at the Olympics, recorded a personal best time of 1 minute, 45.36 seconds in the 1,500
With the release of a trove of candid and even cringe-worthy emails and documents, Viacom on Thursday claimed that YouTube knew full well that much of its content violated copyright but instead turned the other way, seeking to boost traffic on its site and the value of its company.

But in defending itself in Viacom's $1 billion federal copyright infringement suit, YouTube countered that Viacom sought to benefit from the user-upload site's promotional value, posting its own clips on the site even as it complained of pirated material.

And in some cases, YouTube says, Viacom's marketers secretly deployed third parties to post videos from Paramount and other subsidiaries in an effort to make it look as if its content was gaining grassroots popularity. Moreover, YouTube points to documents that showed that Viacom wanted to buy YouTube or to enter into a content partnership, only to file suit when no agreement was struck. Google bought the company for almost $1.8 billion in 2006.

Undoubtedly, both sides would have preferred to keep some of this material private. However, when both sides filed for summary judgment, U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ordered that the documents had to be released, as they would be cited in the filings.

Viacom's suit, filed in 2007 in a New York federal court, highlights the extent to which, just a few years ago, old media grappled with how to embrace new media and at the same time ensure that its content could be protected.

The heat on YouTube, however, has diminished in recent years as the site has deployed more sophisticated technology to identify copyright abuses.

In seeking damages from YouTube, Viacom is attempting to show how its founders, almost from it start in 2005, recognized the potential liability for posting pirated content yet largely disregarded those concerns, knowing that the site depended on premium videos -- as opposed to the homegrown content featuring favorite pets or curious stunts -- for traffic.

In a March 5 motion for partial summary judgment, Viacom said the YouTube founders saw that its success hinged on building a business "based on piracy," and that they "cast a blind eye to and did not block the huge number of unauthorized copyrighted works posted on the site."

Moreover, they say Google was aware of the perils of featuring pirated content on its own video site before it bought YouTube, but "abandoned its scruples in order to continue growing the YouTube user base until well into 2008." It also said YouTube had its own fingerprinting and filtering technologies to block pirated works, but "engaged in a form of high tech extortion" by refusing to apply the technology to protect Viacom content unless Viacom first agreed to license its clips to the site. "If you were not willing to give them your content for nothing, they were going to keep stealing," Michael Fricklas, Viacom's executive vice president and general counsel, told Daily Variety on Thursday.

Viacom points to a wealth of emails it says shows that YouTube's founders were aware of the "knowledge of and intent to benefit from massive copyright infringement on YouTube."

In a July 29, 2005, email about competing video websites, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen wrote to co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, "steal it!" Hurley responded: "hmm, steal the movies?" Chen replied: "we have to keep in mind that we need to attract traffic. how much traffic will we get from personal videos? remember, the only reason why our traffic surged was due to a video of this type. . . .viral videos will tend to be THOSE type of videos."
Let us hope Donnie Walsh's free-agent signing this summer works out better than the one he made in December with Jonathan Bender.

Bender's season is over as he will have surgery Monday on his broken ring finger he injured Friday vs. Philly. Bender's career may be over, at least with the Knicks, who are not expected to bring him back next season.

The 6-11 Bender played in 25 games and averaged 4.6 points. He had an excellent start, playing with panache his first three games before petering out. Bender was only playing Friday in place of injured David Lee and Wilson Chandler.

In the end, it wasn't worth the expenditure or the fact it teed off Eddy Curry, who was benched after three games to make way for Bender.

MSG P.R. man Sammy Steinlight leaves the Garden in a week (check out tomorrow's Rumble for more on his future). Steinlight will be sorely missed.

The best tip Sammy ever gave me was not Knicks-related. A diehard Springsteen fan, he called one afternoon a few years back and said he's hearing from sources Springsteen was going to make a surprise appearance that night at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.

A Springsteen band member, Suzie Tyrell, was the headliner and Bruce, Sammy claimed, planned to take the stage for a few songs. My friends and I skeptically piled into a car and made the long drive from Long Island. Sammy's rep was on the line as there's always frequent false rumors of Bruce at the Stone Pony. Bruce indeed showed that night and Sammy became a legend among my friends.
"Are you a film buff who can't seem to find a way to put your excessive knowledge of movies to good use? Do you think: ""Gosh, if I knew as much about stocks as I do about Hollywood, I'd be rich!""? Well, your time may have finally come. Investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald will be starting an online service in April that will allow users to bet on the success (or failure) of movies. Anyone could use the service -- not only the film industry. Though, unlike NYU film school students, studios would have an actual legitimate business reason for using the exchange: they can hedge their investments in movies. So even though this idea might seem sort of silly to the serious stock investor, it's no more ridiculous than Exxon using oil futures to hedge energy prices.

And you don't only have to go long on a film: you can also short movies that you think will flop. For example, if they ever decide to put Dane Cook in a movie again, you can bet that it'll be a stinker. I know I would.

This does raise an interesting question about insider trading. For example, if Brad Pitt just made a movie that he now realizes was a big mistake, because it's absolutely horrendous, can he bet against it? He clearly has nonpublic information. What if he tells his friend George Clooney how bad it is, and Clooney shorts the film? Or what if I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening to come to the same conclusion? That's a little bit like hearing a company's earnings before release. I'd hope the SEC has given these considerations some thought before approving the new exchange.

Betting on films could happen before in just-for-fun exchanges and probably for real money in Vegas. But I'll be curious to see how a real exchange does -- and who uses it more. Even though it would only have legitimate appeal to studios, if my movie-loving friends' passion for film is any indication, the exchange could be wildly popular. Anyone could use the service -- not only the film industry. Though, unlike NYU film school students, studios would have an actual legitimate business reason for using the exchange: they can hedge their investments in movies. So even though this idea might seem sort of silly to the serious stock investor, it's no more ridiculous than Exxon using oil futures to hedge energy prices."
Pope Benedict has apologised to the victims and survivors of clerical abuse in Ireland and expressed his disappointment at the failure of Irish bishops to deal appropriately with abuse allegations. In his long-awaited Pastoral Letter, he writes: "I can only share in the dismay and the sense of betrayal that so many of you have experienced on learning of these sinful and criminal acts and the way Church authorities in Ireland dealt with them."

The picture shows Cardinal Sean Brady handing out copies of the Letter at Saint Patrick's Cathedral today. The cardinal began his speech of welcome for the Letter with these words: "My dear people of the Cathedral Parish of Armagh, today is a very historic day for the Catholics of Ireland. Pope Benedict has written a pastoral letter to express his closeness to us at this challenging time." In expressing his closeness, the Pope also told the Cardinal and his episcopal colleagues that their credibility and effectiveness have been "seriously undermined" by their failure to act appropriately to protect children from abuse.

The Pastoral Letter is historic for a number of reasons, not least because it is the first official papal document dealing with the clerical abuse crisis facing the Catholic Church for 25 years. The Letter, as predicted, does not explore issues of organisational reform within the church in ireland, but the Pope announces that he plans to send Apostolic Visitors to certain dioceses, religious orders and seminaries in Ireland. That may be an indication of further proposals for re-organising the church or dealing with systemic issues that permitted abuse to continue unchecked for so long.

Pope Benedict also calls on the Irish church to re-embrace the disciplines of Catholic spirituality; that section of the Letter may prove controversial because it is clear that the Pope believes that the loss of those disciplines, alongside the rise of certain kinds of modernist ideas and practices within the western church, helped to create the conditions in which the abuse crisis was born (see paragraph 4).
When job-seeking illustrator Laura Levy first met the team of Wall Street Journal hedcut artists in the early 1980s, she was struck by their peculiar task.

"I saw what these people were doing and I thought, 'they're insane,'" says Levy. "They're sitting there all day long drawing one tiny little drawing with pen and ink.

"But it turns out I must be nuts, because it's fantastic," says the now veteran staff artist. For a newspaper that for more than a century celebrated the lack of images within its pages, it is surprising to note that the Journal's signature mark is the dot-ink portrait.

In explanation of that visually-averse legacy, former executive editor Fred Taylor famously said, "I've always thought that one word was worth a thousand pictures."

But while the paper's world-class reporting has propelled the Journal brand, it's the stipple drawing, pioneered by Journal artists 30 years ago, that has become a trademark.

"It's an icon," says staff artist Nancy Januzzi, of the miniature portraits. "It really is the look of The Wall Street Journal."

Since 1979, the drawings, or hedcuts, have become much more than the currency and certificate engravings they were modeled on. So many likenesses of prominent figures have been featured that to have one's hedcut appear in the Journal is, for most, a seminal moment.

"It sort of became a status symbol," says staff artist Hai Knafo.
Peter Sellers is back at work again. Perhaps nostalgia is in order. Until a few years ago, Sellers was the funniest comedian in the movies. He turned out a series of splendid British comedies (now inhabiting the late show), and even after he got to Hollywood he stayed funny. "The Pink Panther" was good and "Dr. Strangelove" was great and "What's New, Pussycat" had its moments.

But then, alas, Sellers started believing the back-slappers, and they told him he was naturally funny. He isn't. He has his moments, but most of the time he has to work like any other comedian. There have been a few naturally funny comedians, like W. C. Fields, and all they have to do is stand there (or weave back and forth) and you laugh. But the mortals have to work.

So anyway, Sellers started getting lazy. You could almost predict a new Sellers movie. It would have Sellers arching his eyebrows and muttering under his breath, Sellers delicately not touching a luscious starlet, Sellers rolling his eyes, Sellers doing his Napoleon imitation. The low point in his self-indulgence came in "Casino Royale," a film unjustly neglected in the lists of last year's worst.

All of this is one reason why "The Party" is so enjoyable. Sellers works. He develops a character and plays it, for better or worse, for the whole movie. No costume changes. No Napoleon suits. Sellers is Hrundi V. Bakshi, a painfully polite actor from India who courteously and delicately sabotages the evening of several dozen guests and an elephant. He is assisted by a hilariously drunken butler (Steve Franken).

The story has to do with a party in the home of a Hollywood studio chief. Director Blake Edwards begins in low key, with cocktail music tinkling in the background while everyone nods politely and Sellers' shoe floats over the waterfall in the living room. The insanity gradually escalates, but for the first two-thirds of the movie the events remain painfully close to life. Who among us, for example, has not waited politely outside the bathroom door at a party, a glassy smile concealing our agony?

Edwards directs with economy for most of the way, but when the living room fills up with soapsuds and the elephant, he can't help lingering over the expensive scene he's produced. This is an occupational weakness of directors, who figure since they're spending so much money they ought to get at least 15 minutes of movie out of their grand finale. But chaos should be taken in moderation.
Put down your flamingo mallet for a moment, sit at your ravenlike writing desk, and work out this equation: Add one Tim Burton plus one mathematician by the name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and divide by the magical World of Disney. Multiply the result with hallucinatory visual effects, stunning design, and scene-chomping acting. Then add two Alice novels and a dozen or so Wonderland characters before subtracting a bit of the original sense of play and randomness. Then add three dimensions, divide a loaf by a knife, and carry the tea. The product? Walt Disney Pictures' Alice in Wonderland. But callooh, callay, what’s this you say? Not familiar with Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, flamingo mallets, and ravenlike writing desks? Well, National Geographic is here to help. In 1991 the magazine published a story on Dodgson, better known by his pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The author of our story informed me that her lifelong love for Dodgson’s craft and ability to play with words had motivated her to pitch the piece. She retraced the geographic world that inspired the author and his stories, viewed the original manuscript at the British Library, and met with the granddaughter of the Alice. Read Cathy Newman's story. Marvel at Sam Abell's photographs and the wonderfully illustrated story map of Wonderland by William H. Bond. Not only will you get an excellent primer for the adventures and characters you’ll see in the movie, but you’ll also learn that, in fact, 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did National Geographic in the wabe. Whatever that means. As for the movie itself, if you're anticipating a direct retelling of either Alice's Adventures in Wonderland or its follow-up, Through the Looking-Glass, you'll be disappointed (or pleased?). The familiar characters do populate the film, echoes of Dodgson’s words dance (and occasionally galumph) through Linda Woolverton’s screenplay, and John Tenniel’s illustrations are startlingly realized. But it’s not the same old Wonderland. Instead, you’ll find a sincere (though heavy-handed) effort to make sense out of a nonsense story and an attempt to create a sort of plot game that's to be won instead of a game to be played for play‘s sake. I couldn't fully connect with the film's heart for these reasons (it all made too much sense?), and my film companion went further to describe it as very well done made-for-TV movie. I understood, but I should have argued against this, as it didn't feature the greatest acting performance in the history of, like, all time EVER. (Apologies to Anne Hathaway, who portrays the White Queen. Love you, Anne. Really!) The director being Tim Burton, you’re guaranteed nothing less than a fantastic visual poke in the eyeballs. And one shouldn’t expect any less from a film that’s been given a PG rating due to a smoking caterpillar. No, really. Search the MPAA site and see for yourself. Smoking. Caterpillar. Um, YES? One ticket please! As an added bonus, check out New York Magazine's wonderfully trippy photo illustration of Alice in Wonderland's influence on culture.
Tomorrow the FCC will release a national broadband strategy. The plan will set goals for expanding broadband to unserved and under-served areas, promote greater speeds, and drive consumer demand. It will harness this communications technology to urgent national priorities, such as jobs, education, health, energy, and security. In short, the plan will lay the groundwork for investing in America’s future.

Yes, the Internet was invented in the United States. Yes, we once led the world in broadband development. But now, networks in many countries, from Western Europe to East Asia, are faster and more advanced than our own. Long after we recover from this recession, this broadband gap will be a dead weight on American businesses and workers, unless we act now.

As with the space race in the 1960s, America needs a national effort by our scientists, engineers, companies, educational institutions and government agencies. Just like that great national adventure, we need near-term and long-term goals.

Broadband is an essential input to expanding business, education, and healthcare opportunities everywhere. As soon as possible, we need to bring Internet access to every community, from rural America to the inner cities.

But we also need even more ambitious objectives — or “stretch goals” — that test the limits of our ingenuity. When President John F. Kennedy summoned the nation to space exploration, the immediate goal was to send an astronaut in orbit around the earth. But JFK called for “putting a man on the moon” because he knew that dream would inspire Americans to literally reach for the stars.

The private sector has a big job to do, and needs to carry much of the investment. For our part, we plan to build and test an ultra-high-speed broadband network in at least one U.S. community. We are excited by the amount of support our proposed testbed has received from local communities and individuals.

But smart, tailored public policies are critical too. Let’s install broadband fiber as part of every federally-funded infrastructure project, from highways to mass transit. And let’s deploy broadband fiber to every library, school, community health center, and public housing facility in the U.S.

I support a national broadband strategy because ubiquitous broadband connectivity can catapult America into the next level of economic competitiveness, worker productivity, and educational opportunity. But as in the past, we will make this breakthrough by choice, not chance.
Vodafone Group Plc and Bharti Airtel Ltd. were among nine companies that applied to take part in auctions for India’s third-generation mobile-phone services as the South Asian nation seeks to raise money to cut the deficit.

Vodafone Essar Ltd., the Indian unit of the world’s biggest mobile-phone company, and Bharti, India’s biggest wireless operator, were also among 11 companies that applied to participate in auctions for airwaves to run broadband wireless services, India’s department of telecommunications said in a statement today.

India is counting on the proceeds from the auctions to help narrow the fiscal deficit at a 16-year high. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has pledged to cut the deficit to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product in the year starting April 1 from 6.9 percent of GDP in the previous year, the sharpest reduction in 19 years.

The sale could net the Indian government as much as $11.4 billion, Kotak Institutional Equities analyst Rohit Chordia, wrote in a report on March 15. “This would provide the government scope to lower fiscal deficits by about 0.3 percentage points of GDP.”

Competition among phone companies at the bidding could “stretch balance sheets amid the ongoing price wars,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Sunil Garg wrote in a report today. “We expect intense competition for the three available spectrum slots.”

Other Applicants

The other applicants for third-generation services were Aircel Ltd., controlled by Malaysia’s Maxis Communications Bhd., Etihad Etisalat Co., Saudi Arabia’s second-largest mobile-phone company, Idea Cellular Ltd., Reliance Telecom Ltd., S Tel Pvt., Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Videocon Telecommunications Ltd.

Norway-based Telenor SA’s Indian unit, Uninor, decided to skip India’s airwaves auction because it is yet to get the airwaves it has already paid for, and doesn’t believe there is enough demand in India for high-speed data services, the company said in a statement today.

“Telenor is making a conscious decision to preserve cash to focus on voice services for the huge rural population,” said Saeed Baradar, a telecommunications sales specialist at Societe Generale SA in London. “It’s an excellent strategy given the high-capacity, low-return nature of data services in a limited data market. I remain a buyer here.”.

Other countries have seen bidding for 3G auctions raise billions of dollars for their governments. The U.K. got $35 billion in 2000, while Germany received $46 billion at its sale.
"The puzzlement to me is how this fits with the previous 25 years of his political life -- rather, what retrospective light it sheds on that time. Bayh has held elective office since he was 30. He became Indiana's governor at 33 and U.S. senator at 43. If he really cared about his Indiana constituents and their problems through that time, great! But if so, how can he walk away with this kind of careless disregard about whether, in the style of his departure, he is smashing up things that had said were important to him. If, on the other hand, these issues and people never really mattered that much, and public life had been a kind of popularity contest -- well, that may be true of a lot of politicians, but they don't like to reveal it quite this bluntly.

Here's a constructive suggestion: Do you really care about the partisanship that is ruining public life and that, as you said, has driven you from the Senate, Mr. Bayh? Then why not use the fact that you are still in the U.S. Senate for most of another year -- a platform 99.999% of Americans will never occupy -- and apply all the power you can to advance causes you care about. What is holding you back?

Unlike everyone else up for election this year, you don't have to worry how this or that bout of truth-telling will look on Election Day. Let 'em bitch! You don't need an interest group to endorse you or a civic club to applaud you any more. Do you think hyperpartisanship is destroying the Senate? Why not call out people -- by name, by specific hypocritical move -- when you see them doing what they should be ashamed of? I guarantee that the press would eat this up. Why not a ten-month public seminar, through the rest of this year, on who is doing what, and how it could be different? Do you object to personal ""holds"" on nominations? Make it an issue! You have an idea of some issue where Republicans and Democrats might agree? Be specific about it and see what you can do. Again, if I know anything about the press and the melodrama of public life, I know you could turn it to your advantage -- and the public's, Mr. Smith style. Your father, Birch Bayh, became a senator even younger. He was 34 when he took office, and 52 when defeated by Dan Quayle. In between -- through three Senate terms, 18 years -- he acted as if he was using his office for something, rather than just occupying it. That is part of the reason he eventually became vulnerable, as someone too ""liberal"" for his base. His punishment was to That was my policy on the few times I improbably saw a Sam Adams or Rogue Dead Guy beer in a mainland Chinese store. All of this was defense against the bleakness of the local offerings."
I recently made a cameo appearance in a three-part BBC documentary about tweed; I was wheeled in to give a bit of historical context and to enthuse on the subject. The documentary dealt specifically with Harris tweed, a unique hirsute cloth made in Scotland's Outer Hebrides Islands. Its pretext was the changes being wrought in what is, quite literally, a cottage industry, with individual weavers working in their homes or garden sheds to make a cloth that is then returned to the mill, where it is finished and shipped all over the world. Its character owes much to an image thick with peat smoke and Gaelic, gently tinted by a thousand hues of lichen dye.

But even the most ardent tweed enthusiasts, among whom I count myself, will admit the industry has been declining since a peak of production in the late 1960s of about 7 million yards per year. It was with a view toward reviving the industry that a couple of years ago a Yorkshire textiles magnate called Brian Haggas bought the largest mill and set out to relaunch Harris tweed by making thousands of tweed jackets in a palette of colors drastically reduced from about 8,000 to four.

It was a controversial move and the BBC documentarian Ian Denyer joined the story just as Haggas, saddled with thousands of unsold tweed jackets, had to take drastic action. "I arrived at a point where Haggas had told the weavers that he was halting production until he had sold some of his jackets," says Denyer.

But it was not all bad news; Haggas's plans gave an unexpected fillip to the business of two other mills, in Shawbost and Carloway, which stepped in to fill the color vacuum. In making the film, Denyer, a tweedophile himself, was struck by the genuine worldwide enthusiasm for the fabric, and it would appear that viewers were moved, too. Since then, Haggas has sold some of his jackets and been inspired to make a fifth model, aimed at a younger customer, which even goes so far as to feature a traditional polychromatic check.

Denyer thought his series was affectionate, so he was surprised at complaints from some who felt that it portrayed the island and its cloth in an overly folkloric way, viewing Harris tweed as an almost ethnographical curiosity. But it is the ethno-specific character of Harris tweed that might well ensure its survival. With its strong innate regionality, unique manufacturing process, and romantic locus, tweed plays into the modern appetite for products that have an authentic character rather than a manufactured brand identity. A low-carbon manufacturing process—the looms used by the weavers are foot-powered—only adds to the appeal.

Like many things that have become ineffably British, tweed was largely a 19th-century invention. After the Jacobite uprising of 1745, the wearing of tartan was banned; but the later influx of affluent Victorian landowners lured north of the border by the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the joys of field sports popularized the district checks and estate tweeds that identified those who lived and worked on their acres. Hard-wearing, breathable, and executed in shades matching the landscape, tweed was the cloth from which the sportswear of the British Empire was cut.
Wednesday night that Americans still, after all these months, do not know Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama.

Obama needs to explain his past, McCain told viewers.

McCain targeted Bill Ayers, who once served on a foundation board with Obama.  Ayers, a leader of the terrorist Weather Underground in the 1970s, has said that he took part in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, the Capitol building in 1971, and the Pentagon in 1972.

"I don't regret setting bombs," Ayers said in 2001. "I feel we didn't do enough."

Obama said he’d condemned Ayers’s violent past, had not involved him in his campaign, and wouldn’t have him as an advisor in the White House.

McCain also assailed the liberal group ACORN which has run a voter registration effort which is under investigation in Nevada and other states after some of its organizers turned in fraudulent registrations to election officials.

'One of the greatest frauds in voter history'
“We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN who is now on the verge of possibly perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history,” McCain said.
People all over the blogosphere -- OK, some people -- have been asking about the mayor's leadership in the Google Fiber race. "Where's the mayor?" they ask.

Amanda at Inside Scoop checks in.  Knight said he supports the idea, but has left the issue to council members like Zack Matheny, who can speak about it more proficiently that he can.

I guess that makes sense. OK. so where's Zack? 

I think what people are really wondering is who is the city's voice? Why are the elected officials -- whether they are from City Council, from the county commissioners or are Rep. Howard Coble -- so low-key on this issue, particularly when many other cities are hanging it all out there. Examples: renaming highways after Google; renaming cities after Google; urging firstborns to be renamed Google Fiber; and swimming with sharks for Google. 

It is OK to have fun, isn't it?  

We brought home a passel of awards last night from the AP and the N.C. Press Association. Several items worth noting:

• Betsi Robinson won her second statewide editing award. Since 2003, Betsi and features editor Susan Ladd have won the editing award five times.
• Lorraine Ahearn won three awards in three different categories.
• Jerry Wolford won the photographer of the year award, continuing a darn good year.
• Tim Rickard has won awards in seven of the last 10 contests.

Most significant to me is that five of the awards were efforts by our entire staff.

Full results of all papers here. Our specific size category here.
Only the brave take on a complete renovation while living in the space, but Jay, a professional painter and general handy man, is wired for these types of projects. Their home is made cozy by their choices of plush furniture, throw blankets, and vignetted nooks, and is unified by neutral creams and natural wood. The fresh baked cookies and colorful cut roses adorning all rooms pay tribute to their bed & breakfast inspired feel.

Melissa is a graphic designer and likes incorporating typography. The DIY triptych in the living room exemplifies this as well as the burlap coffee sack curtains she made using simple black ribbon.

All flooring other than the back living room (which is still on their to do list) has mix-matched original hardwood floors and no two rooms are the same. There are polyurethane boards in some rooms, while others are left sanded and dull, making a quilt-like pattern in the space, complimenting their aesthetic.

In their kitchen they removed an L-shaped corner counter top and added a center island from IKEA. In order to integrate the modern island into the space, they covered it with bead board and added a matching laminate counter top. They made the island big enough to fit up to 8 people and use this intimate setting for dinner guests, rather than a formal dining room.

Now that the work is nearly completed, they are looking for another fixer-upper two family and hope to have at it once again.
"I recently organized an exhibition of photographs by Edward Burtynsky, bringing together 12 years of his imagery on the subject of oil at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Burtynsky, a Canadian born of Ukrainian heritage in 1955, is respected internationally for his 25-year focus on industrially-transformed landscapes. His photographs of quarries, factories, mining pits, and railcuts are extraordinary for their depiction of mankind’s organization of the land for resource-extraction and profit. Jennifer Baichwal’s 2006 documentary Manufactured Landscapes is an excellent portrait of Burtynsky, and I highly recommend a viewing of both the DVD and his great books, which include Manufactured Landscapes (2003); Burtynsky – China (2005); and Edward Burtynsky – Quarries (2006).
In organizing the exhibition, it occurred to me that Burtynsky is one of our most Ballardian artists. His intense concentration on the technological sublime; the precisionist geometries of his images; and his evocation of a rationalist (yet mysterious) automatism at the heart of the relationship between man and nature: all seem absolutely the inheritance of Ballard’s insightful understanding of our times.
In writing an essay for the book that accompanies the Corcoran exhibition, I adopted a style in overt homage to Ballard — in hopes that such a literary strategy might help illuminate this great body of work. I also wanted to honor Ballard’s legacy as the foremost imaginative interpreter of the world Burtynsky documents. The editors of Ballardian.com have graciously agreed to reprint the essay here as an extension of that homage. Readers of this site will recognize the tropes, the ideas, and the specific sources I’ve drawn from Ballard’s oeuvre; I hope they will forgive any lapses, or excesses, as my own error. The subject is not oil. In these pictures, Edward Burtynsky shows the man-made world—the human ecosystem—that has risen up around the production, use, and dwindling availability of our paramount energy source. The mechanics and industry of extraction and refinement; the development, products, and activities associated with transportation and motor culture; and the wreckage, obsolescence, and human cost that lies at the End of Oil. These photographs are about man, and what he has made of the earth.
Burtynsky starts at the center of the subject, at oil’s source; then moves outward around the world, showing its use. By their arrangement, the photographs survey a life cycle. Each black drop follows a path; following the pictorial sequence, we can imagine ourselves trailing in its wake.
The journey is an unusual one. We have rarely seen images of these places. Some, we didn’t know existed; others, we never thought we’d see. Has any artist ever documented this manifold subject in such depth? This is a new form of epic history painting. Turning his camera lens to a fever dream, Burtynsky forges a new mythology for the 21st century from the lexicon of realism. With stunning detail, from improbable perches, in strange and beautiful colors, these pictures show their subjects with clinical accuracy, and with definitive force. But they also tell a parallel and more inchoate tale: a critique of civilization, and a foretelling of human ends. Some visual experiences test our capacity for explanation—our ability to extract meaning, or convey affect, through existing vocabulary."
The International Skating Union has decided to allow Olympic bronze medalist Joannie Rochette of Canada to perform an exhibition tribute to her late mother at an unsanctioned competition Thursday in Connecticut.

That decision comes in the wake of criticism that included a blog entry I wrote Sunday taking the ISU to task over its unwillingness to bend rules given the unusual nature of the situation.

Michael Slipchuk, high performance director of Skate Canada, sent a Tuesday email to concerned parties with the ISU's decision.  Here is its text, from a copy obtained by the Chicago Tribune:

"The ISU has agreed to relax ISU rule 136 for Joannie, due to the unique and extenuating circumstances of this particular request,  and allow her participation in an exhibition number only (not a competition) at MGM Grand at Foxwoods, USA.

"Therefore, Skate Canada has also granted a sanction for her participation in this event."
Buffalo real estate developer Carl Paladino is making it clear that this is going to be a three-way Republican gubernatorial primary, with Paladino going up against Republican Rick Lazio and Democrat-turned-Republican Steve Levy.

But no Republican really has a shot of winning statewide office without the support of--and ballot from--the Conservative Party. That group is meeting tomorrow and may make an endorsement. The leading candidate to get the Conservative line is Lazio, who has the backing of Conservative State Party Chairman Mike Long. Republicans leaders are backing Levy, but Long doesn't approve of that.

Paladino's campaign manager, Michael Caputo, told me his candidate is the only true fiscal--and social--conservative in the race. If Conservatives back Lazio, Paladino's aide said they'll have no choice but to petition to create the Tea Party ballot line.

"Let's face it, if the Conservative Party endorsed Lazio, we really don't have a choice," he said, "other than to create a Tea Party line."

"Because, historically, Republican gubernatorial candidates have not been elected without the Conservative Party endorsement. But in order to change history, we have to form a whole different option."
Ah yes, famed technology writer Bruce Emmerling. Famed technology writer Bruce Emmerling who can’t grammar or spell-check his work, and writes with a mastery of his subject akin to that of a 6th grader rushing to complete a paper on a book he hasn’t even read.

Honestly, this is what tops Google’s “news” results in science and technology? If that’s the case, we should be kinda worried. We’re quickly moving from citizen journalism (a dangerous / questionable proposition to begin with) to bot journalism… at least that’s how the above article reads.

Remember, you may be discerning, but most people aren’t, and most people will take a story like this — poorly sourced, poorly written — and digest it as fact. Now, there’s nothing particularly inaccurate about this piece of news — except that it’s written like garbage and essentially cites no sources. Plus, most media outlets reported on this last week, so why is it front page news now? And why does the article refer to “reviewers” when no one has actually used or reviewed the device? And who the fuck is Bruce Emmerling?

Examiner.com (and sites like it, hello Associated Content) should be closely watched by those who care about honest reporting and reliable sources. Here is a site that mixes random, unknown entries with aggregated (er, scraped) content from CBS and sites like ours. It is a dangerous and dishonest mixture which most people won’t catch.

I know, some of you will call foul here. Say I’m being hypocritical. Claim Engadget is guilty of all the offenses I’m griping about. But, of course, you’ll be wrong whether you believe it or not. Sure, we’re not a traditional media outlet — not the kind the world has known for hundreds of years — but we do have a stringent process for both reporting news and choosing the people on staff who write that news. It’s not a perfect process — nothing is — but it’s a process. I’m not sure the same can be said for Examiner.

Look, a shifting perception of media / journalism is one thing, but we’re starting to dismantle the basic structures in which we test the validity news, provide an editorial process, and at least pretend to care about some diligence and transparency. With arm-chair enthusiasts cranking out a tsunami of edit-free noise like the above story, being able to find the real story — or dry land — will soon seem like a distant memory.
From wind turbines to cell phones, rare earth minerals play a big role in advanced technology, and they could be key for future clean energy. But congress is worried about the fact that almost all of these materials come from China, and could be subject to tight export controls by that country's government.

The subject was discussed yesterday at a hearing, where experts called on the U.S. government to take steps not only to promote domestic production of these materials, but to fund research to find ways to recycle them, to use less of them, and to do without them altogether.

The work has already started. In one recent example, the new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, recently awarded $4.5 million to develop motors and generators that use magnetics containing low amounts of rare-earth materials. The project is ambitious:
I'm trying to find a balance between sharing my ADHD experience in a blog and putting too much personal information out there in the digital world. Yogi Berra, the Sage of the Grand Concourse, the omphaloskeptic Neapolitan, once said, "When you come to a fork in the road, you should take it." I haven't a clue how one would accomplish that, but I am at a fork in the road. The blame for my erratic blog submissions to ADDitude can be laid on several doorsteps: my innate laziness, my inability to manage my time with any dexterity or consistency, even, mirable dictu, my very affliction with The Deficit. But issues of privacy and modesty, or shame, loom larger and larger. While I'm interested in the whole panorama of the ADHD experience, I find that doing research on the latest ADHD meds or a controversial diet plan is less attractive than looking inward, trying to figure out how the affliction has affected my life, how it interacts with my other shortcomings, and what if anything I can do about it. In addition, I have been told that the postings in which I'm talking about myself, my emotional condition, my constant, one would like to say Homeric, battles with depression and insolvency, attract more readers and more comments than anything I might write about the color of the new Concerta formulations (less, for all the relative frivolity, than the issue of whether there should be blue M&Ms, for example.) But there's a point where I don't want to write about myself. Or, more accurately, want to but feel uncomfortable. After all, I'm sure you're all very nice, concerned, ethical folks. I'm sure the snickering I hear is generated in my own head, and not in yours. But self-revelation has a price, especially in this age where privacy has, for all intents and purposes, become a rare, perhaps non-existent commodity. So I'll continue to try to find a balance between my personal situations and my obligations to my ADHD blog, and if I find it necessary to lie a little here and there, so be it. None of you will ever know the difference, except for a handful of people who know me personally, and, for the most part, I've managed to alienate them sufficiently that they don't care. I'm just sayin', you know?
I think one reason why such things don't both us, as NLPers, as much as they bother the average machine learning person is that we are willing to invest some energy in intelligent initialization. This already puts us in a good part of the optimization landscape, and doing local hillclimbing from there is not such a big deal. A classic example is the "Klein and Manning" smart initializer for unsupervised parsing, where a small amount of human knowledge goes a long way above a random initializer. Another style of initialization is the IBM alignment model style. IBM model 4 is, of course, highly non-convex and ridiculously difficult to optimize (the E step is intractable). So they do a smart initialization, using the output of model 3. Model 3, too, is highly non-convex (but not quite so much so), so they initialize with model 2. And so on, down to model 1, which is actually convex and fairly easy to optimize. This sequencing of simple models to complex models also happens in some statistical analysis, where you first fit first order effects and then later fit higher order effects. The danger, of course, is that you got to a bad hill to climb, but this overall generally appears to be a bigger win than starting somewhere in the middle of a random swamp. (Of course, later, Bob Moore had this cute argument that even though model 1 is convex, we don't actually ever optimize it to the global optimum, so doing clever initialization for model 1 is also a good idea!) These two ideas: clever initialization, and sequential initialization, seem like powerful ideas that I would like to see make their way into more complex models. For instance, in the original LDA paper, Dave Blei used an initialization where they pick some random documents as seeds for topics. As far as I know, no one really does this anymore (does anyone know why: does it really not matter?), but as we keep building more and more complex models, and lose hope that our off the shelf optimizer (or sampler) is going to do anything reasonable, we're probably going to need to get back to this habit, perhaps trying to formalize it in the meantime.
Overwhelmed by the massive, 1,000+ card Yankee Stadium sets that have come out this year? Me too. That's why I've got a better idea. If you want to celebrate Yankee Stadium in your own way, collect those cards that feature it in the background. The same can apply for those of you sick and tired of all things Yankee, who would rather focus on Shea Stadium and the Mets. Because Topps calls New York City its home, many of its cards feature the two current New York City ballparks as part of the background. 1970 was a big year that comes to mind immediately, but there are plenty of others. And the best part of these DIY Yankee and Shea Stadium legacy sets is that your sets won't be composed of just Yankees or Mets--your set will include most or all of the other major league clubs as well. Now I'm not a Yankees fan, but something like this appeals to me as a fan of baseball history, much more than a set full of cards of the same handful of players ad nauseam. (From sorting through a few thousand cards from the 1970s, a Fenway Park Legacy set could also be put together this way.)
To all my friends, I'm sorry. I think about this blog often, but can never find the time to write on it. I have 3 of the 4 kids sleeping. My 23 month old was taken to the hospital to get play dough taken out of his ear. Yup, the reason I have time to write is because my goofy son wanted to see what having play dough in his ear was like. My wife just called and it's out. They'll be home in 5 minutes. All is well at casa de la insano. PS. Robin is expecting again. This will be number 5............................god help us;) Time to get neutered I guess.
I'm a fan of Elvis Presley. It's the fact that he was a bit of an ass, that he was a drug addict at the end, that he had three TV's, that he had a Jungle Room at Graceland, that he laughed and talked during live recordings, that he was fond of ridiculous jumpsuits and that his album cover art was so darn cool. I'm not talking about the original "Elvis Presley" self-titled album with the rock-a-billy photo and the green and pink text overlay that The Clash ripped off and seems an odd-yet-completely-legitimate choice of inspiration for the design of the 1984 Topps set. That album cover deserves its own, separate dissertation. I'm talking about the gold lamé army of Elvii raining down on the cover of "50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong." I'm not sure that's even the name of the album, come to think of it. Doesn't matter. The point I'm trying to make is that if you squint real hard at the American League All-Star stickers that I'm finding at an alarmingly common rate, all decked out in their gold foil, if you try real hard, you can almost see Elvis smiling back. Key word there is "almost." I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl after opening 10 packs of stickers and not finding a single double. Let that sink in. Ten packs of five stickers each and no doubles. I completed nearly 20% of the set in one fell swoop. Unheard of. Unbelievable. Especially in this box, this treacherous box of Dusty Bakers and Hosken Powells, Al Olivers and Chet Lemons. Here they are, in all their glory.
Contrary to what Donruss would want you to believe, Fred McGriff never won an MVP award. Did he ever deserve one? No, probably not. But so what? Teams need players like McGriff to be successful. In a similar vein, someone recently said that teams wouldn't win with a whole roster of Dustin Pedroias. Why not? The guy has over 200 hits, 100 runs, he hits for average, he's a good fielder... what's not to like? Is it because he's short? Scrappy? Prematurely bald? Is it because he does that weird thing with his mouth and eyes before every swing? The same could be said for Fred McGriff. Could a team win with a roster of Fred McGriffs? Who wouldn't want a bunch of guys consistently smacking 35 homers, driving in runs and hitting for average? Though until recently Pedroia had been putting together an MVP-like season, guys like Pedroia and McGriff aren't really MVP-caliber players. They're complementary guys. They're guys who make a lineup formidable. And though they're not a given lineup's heavy hitter, they're guys pitchers don't want to face in any situation. They're like Thursday night. It's not quite Friday, but you're almost there.
I get emails from my local card shop, and in it I read today that Upper Deck canceled the remainder of its forthcoming baseball products, including Goudey (this must be what happens when you settle out of court with MLB Properties). I also read that the USA baseball stuff it was going to produce will now be produced by Topps. All of this is incredibly interesting to me, and not simply because I collect sports cards. It's interesting to me because it all boils down to one person. In my opinion, all of this movement of the last year – official licensing, lawsuits, and the like – stems from Michael Eisner's involvement in Topps. And I'd say that Major League Baseball wants to be in bed with a big guy like him – not some small-pond guy like Richard McWilliam. At Disney, Eisner was a big fish in one of the biggest ponds. He's a brand name all unto himself, and in the non-card universe, I'd bet more people have heard of Eisner than have heard of Topps, and certainly more than Upper Deck. This latest development brings back the question: in 2007, why didn't Topps cave to Upper Deck's bid of a dollar more than Madison Dearborn's? Did Shorin know something about a wind of change at MLB Properties? Or was he simply looking out for the best interests of the company and the brand by a) not selling to their number-one competitor, and b) by brazenly puffing out his chest and selling the company his way (albeit not in the best interests of the shareholders) without kowtowing to the upstart? It could be a little of both. The other question is: did MLB Properties have a preference in who bought Topps? I think Eisner has ushered in more good changes at Topps – a shift to the Web, with video and more meaningful interactions with the collector (not just customer service stuff) – than Upper Deck ever would have, or would have had reason to. For Upper Deck to ever seriously think that Topps could be beaten in a one-on-one for exclusive MLB licensing is preposterous, especially with a heavy hitter like Eisner in the mix. So when 2010 Upper Deck debuted earlier this year, it seemed like the company was on a collision course with a court date. Seriously, I get it that baseball is the biggest sport with the most money at stake, but why did Upper Deck produce a regular set without being able to show team logos? If they had to fill shipping quotas, keep the cash flow going until they could get rid of their baseball team, and hoodwink the public in the process, why didn't they put out a set like Studio? Or an innovative, every-card-is-autographed, prom-photo set of everybody in tuxedos? Instead, every card read like Upper Deck was thumbing its nose at Major League Baseball. Also, it feels like Upper Deck doesn't get it that a Topps exclusivity now does not necessarily mean a Topps exclusivity in the future. Yes, Upper Deck is losing millions now, but possibly not future millions. So why burn your bridges?
Sorrow and pity are natural responses to disability in children – but they are misplaced, researchers say. There is no need to feel sad about youngsters with cerebral palsy because they experience life much as other children do – with all its joys and sadnesses, successes and failures. Able-bodied adults tend to view such children in terms of the struggle they face and their lost potential for a full and active life. But that is not how the children see themselves, according to researchers from Newcastle University. A study of 500 children with cerebral palsy in seven European countries has found that across a range of measures, including psychological wellbeing, self-perception and social support, their levels of satisfaction are as high as in other children. Though disadvantaged, in some cases seriously, their impairment is incorporated into their sense of themselves from birth and they embrace life and all it has to offer with the same excitement as other children. Professor Allan Colver of Newcastle University, who led the study, published in The Lancet, said it contained an important message for parents. “Parents can be upset when their child is diagnosed with cerebral palsy but they can now be reassured that most children with the condition who are capable of providing information at the age of eight to 12 have a similar quality of life to other children.” In earlier research, he had shown that disabled children participated less in activities than other children, because of the restrictions imposed by their disability. But they were no less happy. The new study showed their quality of life, as reported by themselves, was no different. “A father came up to me after we reported the results and said, 'You have already made me think differently about my child',” Professor Colver said. The findings reinforced the need for disabled children to be integrated into society, he added. “The change now needed concerns attitudes. Pity and sorrow should not be directed to disabled children because our findings indicate that they experience life as do non-disabled children. Maximum effort is needed to ensure their rights as citizens, rather than as disabled children, to participate in society as fully as other children.” Julie Johnson of Gateshead whose 10-year-old son, Nathan, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at four months, said: “I treat Nathan and his brother the same and I have found that both of them rise to their own challenges. Nathan has problems with his left hand but quite simple steps have enabled him to attend a mainstream school. He is an active, happy child.” Nathan said: “I like all my teachers and I have a big group of friends at school. I have a special board which helps me to write neater. At playtime we play tag and football.”
We'd arranged for Sam to come home today for a few hours a little while ago. Then we got a call this morning ... trying to put it off as there were other staffing problems. However several calls later it was decided Sam could come home. We then got one from Sam to reassure him it was happening. He picks up on all that is going on. But when I picked him up he was very excitable. We found later he had been like that all day. I wonder if that had been the real reason they had been thinking of putting off his visit. The visit kind of went well though until the end. He seemed agitated. He needed space. He became surly in a way that threatened aggression. As we got to the car he opened the door then slammed it even more open almost breaking it off and causing expensive damage. Then he walked off down the road. He had no intention of stopping. He walked on. We were fortunate the nurse with us was a very experienced one who we got on with. We've had similar situations to this with Sam so many times but another nurse might have reacted in a way that could have exacerbated the situation. But his nurse joined Sam on his walk off and I brought up the rear ... staying at a distance at first in case I might make it worse. Sam insisted on walking to some rocks where he used to climb. He needed to feel the rock and sit calmly there for a while to get his thoughts together ... or to combat the demons in his head as he described it to his nurse. Eventually we got him back to the car and back to the hospital. He was still excitable but he was back and safe. Now Jane and I will have a meal together, watch some television, open a bottle of bubbly and wish each other, with thoughts of Nell and Sam, "Happy New Year". A Happy New Year too to all of you reading this.
This post was very interesting because it explained both the positive and negative side of Sickle Cell Anemia. The question at the end encouraged me to do further research and try to find other diseases that have the same heterozygote advantage. After looking on many websites I found the same disease that was posted above, Thalassemia. This disease is similar to sickle cell anemia because it is a malfunction with the red blood cells. Either there are not enough red blood cells or there isn't enough hemoglobin in the red blood cells which effects the oxygen flow. This disease is inherited from the parents of the offspring. There are four forms of this disease called Silent Carrier State, Alpha Thalassemia Trait,Hemoglobin H Disease, Alpha Thalassemia Major. The first listed had one affected gene, the second has two affected genes, the third has three affected genes and the fourth has four affected genes.
Imagine you have a friend who has a budget problem. Every month he spends more than he earns. His credit card bills are piling up. He is clearly on an unsustainable path. Then one day he comes to you with an idea. Friend: I am going to take off a few days from work and fly down to Bermuda for a quick vacation. You: But isn't that expensive? Won't that just add to your growing debts? Friend: Yes, it is expensive. But my plan is deficit-neutral. I have decided to give up that half-caf, extra-shot caramel macchiato I order at Starbucks twice every day. I really don't need that expensive drink. And if I give it up for the next three years, it will pay for my Bermuda trip. You: Well, then, how are you going to solve the problem of your growing debts? Friend: I am going to figure that out as soon as I return from Bermuda. You: But in light of your budget problem, maybe you should give up Starbucks and skip the Bermuda vacation. Giving up Starbucks could be the easiest way to start balancing your budget. Friend: You really aren't any fun, are you? This conversation is meant to illustrate why claims of deficit-neutrality in the healthcare reform bill should not give much comfort to those worried about the U.S. fiscal situation. Even if you believe that the spending cuts and tax increases in the bill make it deficit-neutral, the legislation will still make solving the problem of the fiscal imbalance harder, because it will use up some of the easier ways to close the shortfall. The remaining options will be less attractive, making the eventual fiscal adjustment more painful.
One thing I always wanted: a clear resin toilet seat, the kind that comes embedded with hundreds of pennies. You can find this type of thing in gigantic Las Vegas souvenir stores and other fine outlets of all-American kitsch. I mean, c'mon-- who doesn't like finding money where you least expect it? So then let's fast-forward to the end of September, when Topps releases Treasury Basketball, a product featuring cards literally stuffed with cash. Each box is guaranteed a rip card, with exactly 429 of them containing actual United States currency (neatly folded $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000 bills). OK. I can find a lot of problems with this, the least of which being that Topps has to remove their pack disclaimer that they don't claim to know if cards will have any future value, since 429 cards will be worth at least $10. But that's petty in comparison to the pandora's box this opens. What Topps has created is a lottery. Not just a pseudo-lottery that the card industry has become in general, with packs containing rare autographs and game-used memorabilia, but an actual one with predictable odds and real money changing hands. Kind of scary, isn't it? Here's something else to consider: let's say you find one of the cards containing a $20 bill. Do you open it up? Or is it more valuable than $20 if you leave it intact? Also, what if it's stamped with a 1/50 serial number? Does that make it more valuable than $20? But perhaps the harshest indictment of the state of the card industry is this: Topps is proclaiming that finding actual cash in a pack is the next step in the evolution of the insert card. And they may have caught on to something: it is probably far cheaper to include cash in a product than spending lots more on securing contracts for autographs and game-used memorabilia. And besides, autos and relics have become so commonplace that finding one in a pack no longer carries the same weight it once did. If cash cards in a basketball product with limited originality or appeal works, the practice will soon become a staple of the hobby.
Notes. Well, that's all she wrote: With only 15/75 new stickers, my sticker album will be forever unfinished. And only 11 stickers short. So that means that within my box of 500 stickers, I only got 249 individual stickers (and 251 others). What I find most interesting about this is the idea of where certain stickers appeared within the box, and then how long it took to get a double, and then sometimes a triple, of that sticker [the Pack Pocket hypothesis, introduced in Sunday's post]. Highlight stickers seemed to appear in the first third of the box, World Series and League Leaders appeared in the last third, and All-Stars appeared throughout. Also, I completed the Red Sox team page before receiving a single Padre, and for a very long time was one Jim Palmer sticker from completing the Orioles team page, only then to receive two Palmers within a few packs of each other towards the end of the box. Other Notes... This sticker of Omar Moreno has to be the worst sticker in the entire book. Why isn't he facing the camera? A sane person would not have known it was Moreno... I've been staring at the album cover for a while now and I'm convinced that a) the players obscured by the large "25¢" in the lower right corner are shown in team-less uniforms, which is bizarre, and b) Gary Carter's eyes are closed, which begs the question: Why didn't Topps use a photo of one of the World Series-winning LA Dodgers? Like Valenzuela mid-windup or Ron Cey picking his nose?... And speaking of Dodgers, like the other teams, there are only eight players on the team page: Ken Landreaux, Dusty Baker, Ron Cey, Steve Garvey, Pedro Guerrero, Fernando Valenzuela, Burt Hooton, and Jerry Reuss. OK, so most of them are star players, but because the team won the World Series, I would've thought that Topps would have given them a spread. Because how would you feel if you were Davey Lopes, Mike Scioscia or Bill Russell? Or even Tommy Lasorda, for that matter? If anyone deserved a sticker, it was Davey Lopes. The guy was traded after the 1981 season to the A's presumably because he was 36. But then he goes on to put up respectable numbers for six more seasons, including a great 1985 with the Cubs, where he steals 47 bases while getting caught only four times. I'm Davey Lopes! Gimme my damn sticker! Final Notes. In the next few days I'm going to do a post outlining the entire box, just to see if there's any reason to the madness of opening 100 packs and not finishing the set.
For any parent, finding out that your baby or child has cerebral palsy is nothing short of devastating. It's hard to describe the emotional turmoil you begin to go through when you hear those two words confirmed for the first time. It conjours up all sorts of terrifying thoughts, and some of these I will try to convey over the coming weeks. “Cerebral” refers to the brain and “palsy” to muscle weakness/poor control. Cerebral palsy itself is not progressive (i.e. the brain damage does not get worse). However, secondary conditions, such as muscle spasticity, can develop which may get better over time, get worse, or remain the same. Cerebral palsy is not infectious. It is not a disease and should not be referred to as such. Although cerebral palsy is not “curable” in the accepted sense, training and therapy can help improve function. Ella and her twin brother Max were born extremely prematurely at just 26 weeks gestation (3 months early), and I intend to talk about this in more detail as time progresses. Extreme prematurity (and prematurity in general) present an increased risk of developing cerebral palsy. Unfortunately, during Ella's stay in the various Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) that saved her life, she suffered extensive brain damage as a result of a fungal infection/haemorrhaging (the subject of much debate between the hospitals that looked after her!). Miraculously, and beyond all initial expectations, our little soldiers, Max and Ella, came home to us in March 2006. So to kick this off, it's now 4 months since Ella was diagnosed as showing early signs of cerebral palsy (CP). As with all things web, it's very easy to get bogged down by information overload. I know, I've been there several times! I'm hoping this blog will help to provide a central resource for other parents wanting to know more about CP, and I hope to share our personal experiences with Ella as an ongoing journal.
About 2 or 3 weeks ago I went to Prestatyn in Wales with my mum, stepdad, sister and brother. When we got there I wanted to go home because it was a lot busier than where we went to last year ( borth ). Anyway I stayed and I gradually got used to it. A few days later I wanted to go on the go-karts but I was nervous. So my stepdad and my brother went on first and then my stepdad and my sister went on 2nd, then finally I went on, I had I great time and because I did it I went on loads more times ( about 4 times ) throughout the holiday. I loved walking on the beach and going into the water. So I had a great time. Thanks Mum and Stepdad for paying. Thanks for reading ,bye.
I never saw Fred McGriff play in person. And yet, here he is in Fenway Park circa 1989-1990. A friend of mine used to have tickets about 20 rows behind home plate and I remember going to a number of games around that time. Nor did I ever really watch games that McGriff played in. My family, like everybody else who got cable, got all the Braves games on TBS. But that didn't mean I watched them. So then here's my question: Can I legitimately call McGriff my favorite player if I a) never saw him play in person and b) never made much of an effort to catch his games on TV? I think I'm safe. McGriff fit what I was looking for in a baseball hero. To me, he was obscure. And if you know anything about my values system, obscurity ranks very high. Oh sure, he wasn't a face in the crowd to fans of the game. But ask a random person on the street who McGriff was and I'd bet nine out of ten wouldn't know. And yet, here's the funny thing: if McGriff had spent his career in a baseball mecca like Boston or New York, I'm completely convinced that his national presence would've rivaled that of Boggs, Mattingly or any other of his more famous contemporaries.
I'm not sure whether I'm doing this right or not as I've never blogged before, but I'm in search of information regarding swallowing and blockage. My wife and I are caregivers of my father-in-law who is in later stages of Parkinsons. He was recently diagonosed with severe blockage of the throat as he chokes on everything he eats. His only enjoyment in life has been eating and he refused the recommended feeding tube. Is anyone are of any type of surgery in lieu of the feeding tube?
I started The Baseball Card Blog, funny enough, to blog about baseball cards. Collecting baseball cards, trading baseball cards, buying baseball cards. Dealing—tongue firmly in cheek—with the addiction of baseball cards. Openly questioning the sanity of my own fawning over sports stars and their small cardboard representations. But The Baseball Card Blog became other things as well, though I tried very hard to keep it on topic. This was not to be about my life, unless my life somehow had something to do with baseball cards. This was not to be a forum for ragging on private individuals; I made a point of keeping angry thoughts private. I poured a lot of time into this blog. I spent a lot of energy writing the stuff I wanted to write: dissertations I felt were needed on sparsely represented topics (hello, 1987 Topps); artistic interpretations to epic odes of futility (Casey at the Bat); giving away cards I liked (The Great Goudey Trade-away); highlighting funny things about utilitymen, bit players, managers, and bona fide stars. I enjoyed this kind of thing. And then I didn't. I explored selling the blog. I explored bringing in new writers. Ultimately, none of these were ideas I saw to completion. The Baseball Card Blog was retired. I added a link to the Wikipedia page for Casey at the Bat and nobody took it down. I stopped writing. But I didn't stop collecting. Or reading others' blogs. I kept up with Cardboard Junkie (still my favorite). I started collecting the T118 (World's Greatest Explorers) and T218 (Mecca/Hassan Athletic Champions) sets. I am just about 50% complete on the 1962 Post Cereal set. I started collecting 1956 Topps, 1967 Who Am I?, and lots of miscuts, printing errors and blank fronts and backs. I even got in touch with The Baseball Reliquary in Monrovia, California, about donating a hard copy of the baseball-card Casey at the Bat, but still haven't got my act together to send it along to them. And all of these things slowly made me want to start writing about it all again. Not religiously blogging three or four times a day so that it gets in the way of me living the rest of my life. But simply writing about baseball cards when I have the time. I had to take a year off. Now it's time to dust off the cobwebs, tinker with the setup, and see how long it will take me to put together a set by simply buying packs. BH January 1, 2010
Two recent shareposts, “The Depression-Mania Two Step” (Part I and Part II ), zeroed in on a crucial fact that tends to be overlooked by clinicians, namely: Despite the fact that depression and mania present as polar opposites, the two can hardly be viewed as unrelated. For our own health and safety, they need to be seen together as part of the same cycling phenomenon. Today's depression is tomorrow's mania, but there is another twist: Too often, depression fails to clear the room. Too often, mania doesn't wait to be invited in. The two show up at once. The dance is over. A free-for-all breaks out. The experts refer to the condition as a “mixed” episode or state. Sweet mania turns sour. Vegetative depression becomes animated. Those who have been through either describe the experience as akin to wanting to crawl out of your skin, of feeling the urge to grab the world by the throat and wring it. I used to joke: “I get road rage a lot - and I don't even drive.” Amazingly, for a condition so pronounced, that causes so much distress, the DSM-IV is inexcusably vague, and so will its successor, the DSM-5 (due out in 2013), based on draft proposals issued last month. The good news is that the DSM-5's criteria for a mixed state will be far less restrictive. In light of the fact that in all other respects DSM-IV bipolar and DSM-5 bipolar are virtually identical, this is a very significant development. The current DSM recognizes mixed states only when full-blown depression is accompanied by full-blown mania. Thus: at least five (of nine) depression symptoms accompanied by at least four (of seven) mania symptoms. Technically, then, only those with bipolar I qualify. But in the real world, individuals may experience depression accompanied by only two or three mania/hypomania symptoms. Or mania with just two or three depression symptoms. Don't these symptoms somehow count? Yes, says Ellen Frank PhD of the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview several years ago, Dr Frank explained to me that “even isolated symptoms that don't cluster together to create episodes may be important." A 2004 study she collaborated on with Giovanni Cassano MD of the University of Pisa found that just one symptom of mania (the symptom list in the study was much longer and more refined than the DSM list) in unipolar depression increased risk for suicidal ideation 4.2 percent. More symptoms kept upping the risk. So what do we do with these so-called unipolars? Treat them as if they had pure depression? According to Hagop Akiskal MD of UCSD, in a journal article, “the nonrecognition of depressive mixed state is nothing short of a clinical tragedy because these are the very 'unipolar' depressive patients who are likely to do poorly on antidepressants …” These would be your agitated depressions, an unbearable energized psychic pain. Looking at it from the mania/hypomania side of the divide: In a 2003 grand rounds lecture at UCLA, Trisha Suppes MD, PhD of Stanford described having an epiphany while reading the DSM criteria for hypomania. "I said, wait, where are all those patients of mine who are hypomanic and say they don't feel good?"
If you had ten seconds to grab a few things and dash out of your house before the world around you collapsed, what would you grab? A cell phone? Your checkbook? A clean pair of underpants? Photos of your loved ones? Your medications? Or would you go directly for your favorite cards? I'm not writing this to make you feel bad about collecting sports cards and memorabilia when there are people suffering somewhere in the world, nor to make light of the situation. You don't need a sportscard blogger to tell you that the catastrophe in Haiti is a terrible thing and that you should help those affected in any way you can. I would choose medications, but that's just me. If you said that you would make a bee-line for your cards, don't feel bad: I don't think it's wrong to feel real emotions towards your cards. But let's be practical here. Choosing your sports memorabilia when what you really need is a toothbrush or your Social Security card may not work for more than a few minutes, unless the sports memorabilia has some sort of value in a collapsed world. And this could very well be the case. It would not surprise me in the least that something like a Babe Ruth–signed baseball could hold barter value in a collapsed world, because of the possibility of the world being rebuilt at some point with the same rules and values system that existed before. Sports cards themselves are a different, much-less-convincing subject. So instead of spending valuable seconds determining if you really want to save that sports card — be it a 1957 Topps Frank Malzone or a 2008 Playoff Contenders Matt Ryan autographed rookie — keep it in your wallet. Sure, carrying it around with you in your back pocket will beat it to pieces, but that shouldn't matter if you two truly can't be separated.
So, my youngest brother Sean challenged me to run in the Philadelphia Marathon in 2005. While I've played sports all of my life, I had never liked running. We did it, and I count it as my biggest athletic accomplishment to date. It's 2008, and I plan to run some 5ks's and MAYBE ultimately build back to a marathon, with a 3:30 goal. Follow me as I battle Crohn's disease and a busy schedule.
In case you haven't been following me on Twitter or Facebook the past few days...Tricia was admitted into the hospital on Tuesday evening. An x-ray during her oncology appointment on Tuesday showed something in her lungs...fortunately, he doesn't believe it is lymphoma...it may be a fungal lung infection. Tricia has been coughing for a few weeks, so we figured something was going on. She hasn't been feeling bad, just a little more tired than usual, and a visit last week to the local ER didn't show anything. But, last night, after 24 hours in the hospital and a bronchoscopy that morning, she had a fever of 103. She is feeling better this morning. We are waiting for results from blood work and biopsies to determine what the problem is. They have started her on IV antibiotics. Because she will probably be at Duke through the weekend, Gwyneth and I returned home ysterday afternoon. We'll wait for the call to go back and bring Tricia home. Thanks for your prayers for Tricia this week. I'll update more when I can, and give you an update on Gwyneth's appointments later.
If you compare vision research with NLP research, there are a lot of interesting parallels. Like we both like linear models. And conditional random fields. And our problems are a lot harder than binary classification. And there are standard data sets that we've been evaluating on for decades and continue to evaluate on (I'm channeling Bob here :P). But there's one thing that happens, the difference of which is so striking, that I'd like to call it to center stage. It has to do with "messing with our inputs." I'll spend a bit more time describing the vision approach, since it's probably less familiar to the average reader. Suppose I'm trying to handwriting recognition to identify digits from zero to nine (aka MNIST). I get, say, 100 labeled zeros, 100 labeled ones, 100 labeled twos and so on. So a total of 1000 data points. I can train any off the shelf classifier based on pixel level features and get some reasonable performance (maybe 80s-90s, depending). Now, I want to insert knowledge. The knowledge that I want to insert is some notion of invariance. I.e., if I take an image of a zero and translate it left a little bit, it's still a zero. Or up a little bit. Of if I scale it up 10%, it's still a zero. Or down 10%. Or if I rotate it five degrees. Or negative five. All zeros. Same hold for all the other digits. One way to insert this knowledge is to muck with the learning algorithm. That's too complicated for me: I want something simpler. So what I'll do is take my 100 zeros and 100 ones and so on and just manipulate them a bit. That is, I'll sample a random zero, and apply some small random transformations to it, and call it another labeled example, also a zero. Now I have 100,000 training points. I train my off the shelf classifier based on pixel level features and get 99% accuracy or more. The same trick works for other vision problem (eg., recognizing animals). (This process is so common that it's actually described in Chris Bishop's new-ish PRML book!)
When players come into the league, they either do or do not live up to their hype. Doesn't matter who—Alex Rodriguez, Fred Lynn, Bob Hamelin, or Stephen Strasburg—it seems like everybody is subject to hype. (A great movie about this, in a roundabout way, is Sugar.) But what about the guys who fly under the radar? Guys who just sort of show up? Where do they stand? In a world dominated by information, it's hard to imagine a player making it to the majors today without at least one news source commenting on his talent (or lack thereof). I'm not old enough to remember John Doherty. His statistics suggest he didn't really belong in the major leagues, or the high minor leagues, for that matter, but he hung around the California Angels for parts of two seasons (1974, 1975), and triple-AAA for six others. But you'd think someone must remember him, right? You'd think fans of the game or little kids collecting cards in the mid-1970s would know about John Doherty of the Angels. And maybe they do, but I'd venture a guess that the circle is relatively small—say, limited to the Los Angeles, California–area. The reason? This card of Doherty (1975 Topps) was his only Topps card. Ever. And it's not a memorable card. The only reason I pulled it from a stack last night was because I didn't recognize the face or the name, and because his face was so close to the camera. Right away that's a bad sign, possibly meaning no photo of him in game-play action, or the batting cage, for that matter, was taken (though he's wearing a left-handed batting helmet). Even the signature (from his Topps contract) emblazoned across his neck is hurriedly scrawled, as if Doherty, too, was surprised by the dumb luck of his being called up. The game's history is filled with "cup of coffee" guys. For some players, that means one inning of mop-up duty, or a few games as a fourth outfielder. For others, it's parts of a few seasons, or an exceptional first season followed by a disappointing second. And then nothing. We will remember Stephen Strasburg, no matter how he performs in the majors, just like we remember Clint Hurdle and Brien Taylor. But John Doherty? All I can say is, Who?
There are tons of "how to apply for academic jobs" write-ups out there; this is not one of them. It's been four years (egads!) since I began my job search and there are lots of things I think I did well and lots of things I wish I had done differently. When I entered grad school, I was fairly sure that I eventually wanted a university job. During high school, my career goal was to be a high school math teacher. Then I went to college and realized that, no, I wanted to teach math to undergraduates. Then I was an advanced undergraduate and realized that I wanted to teach grads and do research. Teaching was always very important to me, though of course I fell in love with research later. It was unfortunate that it took so long for me to actually get involved in research, but my excuse was that I wasn't in CS, where REU-style positions are plentiful and relatively easy to come by (system development, anyone?). However, the more time I spend in grad school, including an internship at MSR with Eric Brill (but during which I befriended many in the NLP group at MSR, a group that I still love), I realized that industry labs were a totally great place to go, too. I ended up applying to basically everything under the sun, provided they had a non-zero number of faculty in either NLP or ML. I talked (mostly off the record) with a few people about post-doc positions (I heard later than simultaneously exploring post-docs and academic positions is not a good idea: hiring committees don't like to "reconsider" people; I don't know how true this is, but I heard it too late myself to make any decisions based on it), applied for some (okay, many) tenure-track positions, some research-track positions (okay, few) and to the big three industry labs. I wrote three cover letters, one more tailored to NLP, one more to ML and one more combined, three research statements (ditto) and one teaching statement. In retrospect, they were pretty reasonable, I think, though not fantastic. I don't think I did enough to make my future research plans not sound like "more of the same."
There is a cool view of the whole non-parametric Bayes thing that I think is very instructive. It's easiest to see in the case of the Pitman-Yor language modeling work by Frank Wood and Yee Whye Teh. The view is "memorize what you can, and back off (to a parametric model) when you can't." This is basically the "backoff" view... where NP Bayes comes in is to control the whole "what you can" aspect. In other words, if you're doing language modeling, try to memorize two grams; but if you haven't seen enough to be confident in your memorization, back off to one grams; and if you're not confident there, back off to a uniform distribution (which is our parametric model -- the base distribution). Or, if you think about the state-splitting PCFG work (done both at Berkeley and at Stanford), basically what's going on is that we're memorizing as many differences of tree labels as we can, and then backing off to the "generic" label when memorization fails. Or if we look at Trevor Cohn's NP-Bayes answer to DOP, we see a similar thing: memorize big tree chunks, but if you can't, fall back to a simple CFG (our parametric model). Now, the weird thing is that this mode of memorization is kind of backwards from how I (as an outsider) typically interpret cognitive models (any cogsci people out there, feel free to correct me!). If you take, for instance, morphology, there's evidence that this is exactly not what humans do. We (at least from a popular science) perspective, basically memorize simple rules and then remember exceptions. That is, we remember that to make the past tense of a verb, we add "-ed" (the sound, not the characters) but for certain verbs, we don't: go/went, do/did, etc. You do little studies where you ask people to inflect fake words and they generally follow the rule, not the exceptions (but see * below).
Depressed isn't the same as sad. It's worse than sad. Depression lies closer to numbness. How do people who do not, by the most wonderful roll of the genetic dice, suffer from depression? And, further, how much do they understand about those of us who do? There's been so much talk about depression on television and the internet that I'd have to guess that the average non-depressive person has a better idea of what the story is than was the case decades ago. Big Pharma has spent enormous sums of money "explaining" to people who suffer from clinical depression that it's not their "fault." Typically, the ads contain a quickly-shifting series of micro-vignettes, showing the various forms depression can take. You know them: they show men and depressed women wallowing in misery. Staring off into space. Toying with their food. Ignoring the obligatory, confused and sympathetic golden Labrador. Veiled hints about a lack of connubial bliss. Pitying, confused, resentful glances from co-workers. (Please forgive the absence of my usual parallelism in the preceding phrases. I'm not thinking as clearly as I do most of the time. Wait! Maybe I'm depressed!!! Holy guacamole, Batman.) Awright, awright. Here's the gist of what I'm muttering about. "Depressed" isn't the same as "sad." It's worse than sad. Sadness is a relatively active state, in that you're feeling something. Depression, in my vast experience, both first- and second-hand, lies closer to numbness. When I'm really getting beaten up by my chemicals, I'm not sad. I'm a complete zombie. I'm not afraid, either. My head keeps hearing, or saying (I'm definitely not together enough to start an investigation of the issue of duality) "Don't be sad, don't be frightened. Maybe the frost will work a big piece of a Palladian pediment loose and it will fall on your head as I'm strolling up Madison Avenue, and then you won't have to worry about being sad or frightened, right?" It's truly pathetic how comforting this possibility can be. That's it for now. Depression has its icy hands wrapped tightly around my larynx. But I'm not sad. You want to see sad, watch someone who finds out that his golden retriever is terminally ill. That's sad. I'm just sitting here like a rutabaga, trying to find the strength to go to tai chi.
Today I baked alive at Brimfield Flea Market in Brimfield, Massachusetts. If you've never been there, it's 17 open fields strung along Route 20, which for three weeks of each year are crammed full of leathery-skinned antiques dealers, junk collectors, hoboes, drug addicts, and certified weirdos. And a good time is had by all. This year I went twice (July and September), each time filling up on weird stuff. July's big score was an uncut sheet of Wacky Packages from 1979. This time around I brought home a safe deposit box from an old bank, which coincidentally is the perfect size for holding baseball cards. I also scored on miscut cards. On top of the major haul from Scott in New Jersey (more on Scott's Haul in a later post), these cards are helping make miscuts my next big 'thing.' And just my luck, all three of the miscuts I found today feature Hall of Famers.
...For now, anyway. I missed the end of the Senate Appropiations meeting, but according to an article from YourWestValley.com and a couple of Facebook updates, the measure failed in committee today by a 3 - 5 vote. It could be brought back later via another striker, so it won't be completely dead until the end of the legislative session. However, it's an election year, and all members of the lege are up for reelection in November and very few want to be viewed as someone who thwarted the will of the voters on this topic. So for now, enjoy this small victory, perhaps the only one the average Arizonan will see until the November elections when they'll have the opportunity throw out the ideologues who have worked so diligently to undermine Arizona's future. Later...
Machine learning as a field has been very convex-happy for the past decade or so. So much so that when I saw a tutorial on submodular optimization in ML (one of the best tutorials I've seen), they said something along the lines of "submodularity will be for this decade what convexity was for the last decade." (Submodularity is cool and I'll post about it more in the future, but it's kind of a discrete analog of convexity. There's a NIPS workshop on the topic coming up.) This gives a sense of how important convexity has been. There's also a bit of an undercurrent of "convexity isn't so great" from other sides of the ML community (roughly from the neural nets folks); see, for instance, Yann LeCun's talk Who's Afraid of Non-convex Loss Functions, a great and entertaining talk. There's a part of me that loves convexity. Not having to do random restarts, being assured of global convergence, etc., all sounds very nice. I use logistic regression/maxent for almost all of my classification needs, have never run a neural network, and have only occasionally used svms (though of course they are convex, too). When I teach ML (as I'm doing now), I make a bit deal about convexity: it makes life easy in many ways. That said, almost none of my recent papers reflect this. In fact, in the structure compilation paper, we flat out say that non-linearity in the model (which leads to a non-convex loss function) is the major reason why CRFs outperform independent classifiers in structured prediction tasks! Moreover, whenever I start doing Bayesian stuff, usually solved with some form of MCMC, I've completely punted on everything convex. In a "voting with my feet" world, I could care less about convexity! For the most part, if you're using EM or sampling or whatever, you don't care much about it either. Somehow we (fairly easily!) tolerate whatever negative effects there are of non-convex optimization.
I'm sure you've heard of extrasensory perception (ESP). Well, what I have is EAP, or extra-allergy perception. When you have allergic-asthma as long as I have, this is a skill you develop. Okay, so I suppose you're wondering what EAP is. Well, it's the ability to know when something around you is one of your allergy triggers. It's the ability to know what places you need to avoid. Actually, it's quite a neat skill. As far as I know, I'm the only person alive with this skill. I'll give you an example. As I enter another person's home, I can "sense" as soon as I walk in if that person has a dog. And I know I need to either get out, or prepare myself for an allergy or asthma attack. As I enter my dad's cabin, for example, I can sense that there are a lot of dust mites and molds, and that I must not stay long. I also get this feeling as I enter certain homes. My EAP is pretty accurate too. For example, when I went to Florida a few years ago, my wife wanted to spend the night at her cousins. Well, as soon as I entered that house I had this feeling I was going to have trouble. I told her I was going to have a rough night. "Oh, you'll be fine. It's all in your head," she said. Voila, at bedtime, my allergies and early warning signs showed their ugly faces. I was puffing on my inhaler all night, and I was tired the entire next day. When I got to my parents home the next day I received no such sensation. I knew I'd be safe during the rest of the vacation.
Cool post! When doing research on deseases that can benefit a human body I was unable to find much. However after thinking a bit more, I came to the conclusion that common deseases such as colds can make you less vonarble to other deseases. This is not due to the cold it's selfe but to the reaction your body has due to the cold. One of the reactions you body has when it detects a cold is nasal congestion, which helps keep other viruses away. Altough many do not apreciate nasal congestions, it is essential when it comes to keeping your body healthy. Here is some more information on nasal congestion.
I've been held captive by the 1953 Topps Eddie Mathews Mystique for years. It's officially my favorite card, and I've put off buying it until I had enough money for one in near-mint condition. But then something strange happened. I began to really love miscut cards. And it turned out that there are a plethora of miscut cards from the 1953 Topps set. Needless to say I jumped on this one as soon as I found it. Here's where it gets really great. That other card that's along the bottom? It's the lower tenth of Roy Campanella's card, who's my other favorite player from Mathews' era. I think it's interesting to note that, using this card and the one of Clem Labine I posted previously as examples, Topps seemed to line up their cards one row up, one row down on their uncut sheets. Because the design featured a black box along a portion of the bottom of each card, you'd think that this set would've had a ton of miscuts.
Some of my first thoughts were: How severe will it be? Is Ella going to be diplegic, hemiplegic, quadraplegic? How will she cope? How will we cope (both together and with Ella)? What happens to her when we're gone (not too soon hopefully!) Some thoughts were purely selfish; we're only human. Some thoughts were misdirected rage, looking for someone or something to blame etc., some were of despair. As the time passes, it's becoming easier. I'm fine! … why am I moaning … I don't have CP. I suppose it's because we all want the best for our kids, and CP doesn't fit in with that. Of course it doesn't. But one thing resounds every time I look at the both of them: As 26 weeker preemies, it's a miracle they're even here. 5 months of hell in NICU, with doctors telling you that your kids are unlikely to make it through the night is enough to put your personal angst well and truly in place! Most of the thoughts you begin to realise are selfish ones, and it certainly starts to put other aspects of your life into perspective. It's Ella who counts at the end of the day, and we owe it to her to do whatever we can to make her life as happy and enriched as we can. Unfortunately, Ella was also classified as severely deaf along with her brother back in May. This made things even worse when I found out about her CP diagnosis. I will never forget the moment when I asked the following question at one of their review clinics: “If Ella is deaf and she has CP, how will she be able to communicate?”. He simply replied, “The worst case scenario is that you're looking at life long care in a wheelchair”. He told it how it was, but it really was the worst case scenario, and the truth is, you just don't know how it will pan out until they're around 18 months+. Even then, it's an unwritten book. At the time, I went white, felt sick and the room consisting of my wife and 5 of the community help team went deathly silent. That's the only way I can describe it. My wife asked another question and we moved on. 4 months on, Ella is now showing signs of recovering from her hearing loss, and she's making great strides improving on many of the things she was unable to do. We only suspected CP when she was lagging behind Max in her developmental progression. At the end of the day, she's showing an overwhelming desire to overcome the problems that hinder her, and it's this that we will help her strive to achieve.
Something is wrong with this picture. Yes, there is no actual team depicted on this team card, but perhaps more importantly, there are no fountains beyond the outfield fence of Kauffman Stadium. It's one thing for a terrible team with no discernible national star (Mark Grudzielanek and Emil Brown, anyone?) to downplay a 100-loss season. But it's another thing entirely to rob a sure-to-be-boring card of its one potential highlight. When they don't even bother to turn on the fountains, you know they've given up. It's almost like the Royals were trying to slip by undetected for the year. It's a bold move, one that I'm not sure I agree with, but an interesting tactic nonetheless. Let me see if I've got this right: if you don't put out a team photo, nobody will remember how much you sucked.
to rndssis: I have early onset PD, was diagnosed in 98, and am progressing very slowly. The reason for that, I believe, is that I primarily treat my PD with anti oxidants, including CoQ10, and Cranberry Extract. Also, I delayed taking Sinemet as long as possible, and if I were you, I'd get off it right away! It makes the symptoms better but helps the disease progress because it metabolizes into a chemical that actually kills off the mitochondria in brain cells with oxidative stress! If I were you, I'd try Comtan (slows down the breakdown of dopamine) and one of the dopamine agonists (I take Mirapex, tried Requip but it made me sick). Even though your neurolgist won't like this (If he won't do it, get him to prescribe Sinemet too, and just don't take it), beleive me, you will progress a lot more slowly!
Good news. I'm just back from my 6 monthly appointment with my rheumatologist. When I arrived the nurses asked if I was settling back into Lincolnshire life after that famous holiday. They wanted to know where I'd been to do so much to my liver and were so amused that i had been staying in a convent in Jerusalem. Cue jokes about communion wine. They asked if anyone had commented on last weeks blood test and I said "No not yet". So she looked it up and said that it wasn't really good news because the liver results were a little bit higher yet. Good job she'd taken my blood pressure before telling me that. But when I saw the consultant he wasn't bothered at all. He has agreed that I can reduce the methotrexate to just 4 per week and is happy with how my joints are looking. I specifically asked about the liver results and he said he thought they were more likely caused by the diabetes. When I had last weeks blood test I also had the tests for my annual diabetes review and apparantly my cholestral is raised. He didn't comment on the rest of the diabetic tests so that is a joy I have for next week when i have the review. I have never taken my diabetes seriously because I've always had enough to worry about with arthritis but now that is under control I know I'll have to think diabetes. I've only stopped eating chocolate because of the wish to lose weigh and the weght loss blog so you can see I have to rethink quite seriously. Maybe it's time I also joined the diabetes blog!!!! Well I'd have an extra glass of wine to celebrate but it's weigh in day tomorrow so have to watch the calories!
One of the basic tenets of the Tao of McGriff... Be consistent. Example: Fred McGriff performed in post-season play the same way he did during the regular season: consistently well. Or, I consistently get my hopes up, only for it to result in heartbreak. Staying up late to watch the Red Sox crush the will of the Anaheim of Los Angeles of Interstate 5 of California Angels has given me ample time to contemplate Vlad Guerrero and the importance of post-season performance in the eyes of Hall of Fame voters. For all that has been said about Guerrero's post-season drought, I am completely convinced that, when he is first eligible for the Hall of Fame, he will be elected with one of the highest vote percentages in recent memory. I'm thinking in the neighborhood of 92-94% on the first ballot. I'm not entirely convinced that post-season exploits should weigh that much in the mind of the voter. Sure, it will help McGriff's case that his career postseason batting average is over .300 and he's socked 10 post-season home runs. Post-season success will also help someone like Curt Schilling. His performance with the Diamondbacks in 2001 and with the Red Sox in 2004 and 2007 will bolster his resume in the eyes of the HOF voters. But really if there's anything that should push Schilling into the Hall, it's his character; his playing through pain in clutch situations. I, for one, don't think I could walk around with a tendon stapled to my ankle, let alone pitch. (Well, I guess I could if I was allowed to bring a folding chair to the mound and pitch to Little Leaguers. And I was high on morphine.)
I give you 1968 Topps #38, Tony Pierce, with razor-sharp sides and corners, and I-swear-it's-original-gloss. It's well-centered on the front and the tid-bit of fantastical info on the back is incredible (Tony once struck out 5 batters in one inning at high school). But best of all, you'll go blind looking at it. This particular piece of cardboard badly misaligned when it was time to hit the blue rollers in the printing process, resulting in an almost 3-D effect on the team name and missing ink in other areas. It all feels like a waste, too, since the photo is so boring (it looks like the photographer asked Tony to take his hat off and gaze stoically into the distance, like a tired farmer at the edge of a field). If only this had happened to a card featuring a more dynamically posed player... but this was 1968, so I guess that rules out Vicente Romo doing jazz hands (1970), or Dock Ellis thrusting the ball at the camera in an attempt to get the viewer as high as he was (1969).
The representation put forward for this story is something like: (1) negative-for-John (the car won't start), which leads to (2) motivation-for-John (to get it started, which leads to (3) positive-for-John (it's started), when then links back and resolves (1). You can also analyze the story from Paul's perspective, and then add links that go between the two characters showing how things interact. The rest of the paper describes how these relations work, and how they can be put together into more complex event sequences (such as "promised request bungled"). Again, a high level representation of how stories work from the perspective of the characters. So now I, W, hope that you, R, have an increased belief in the title of the post. Why do I think this is interesting? Because at this point, we know a lot about how to deal with structure in language. From a machine learning perspective, if you give me a structure and some data (and some features!), I will learn something. It can even be unsupervised if it makes you feel better. So in a sense, I think we're getting to a point where we can go back, look at some really hard problems, use the deep linguistic insights from two decades (or more) ago, and start taking a crack at things that are really deep. Of course, features are a big problem; as a very wise man once said to me: "Language is hard. The fact that statistical association mining at the word level made it appear easy for the past decade doesn't alter the basic truth. :-)." We've got many of the ingredients to start making progress, but it's not going to be easy!
This has nothing to do with asthma, yet I'm going to report it off to you anyway. I had a 2-year-old kid I was just scheduled to give a breathing treatment. He was actually diagnosed with pneumonia, and doesn't need the treatment, but that's beside the point. The reason I mention this here is because the kid, when I entered the room, was crying. He kept saying over and over, "Mommy! Mommy!" Yes. He wanted his mommy. He wanted the one person he is most attached to. And yet, she was no where to be found. Once the child was admitted, she went home. So, after I gave my treatment, I sat with the kid. I put on a cartoon on the TV, and I talked to him. It took a while, but I eventually had him calmed down. Then I sat with him for a while, as he snuggled with his little stuffed puppy. This kind of reminded me of when I was two and my parents left me in a hospital all alone. Yes, I was 2 years old in 1972, and my parents left me alone. There was a policy back then that parents weren't allowed to stay in the hospital after hours, so once visiting hours were over, they had to go home.
Backed by a 4-0 week, Scarlet Knight junior Pat Biserta earned Rutgers' first weekly baseball award of the season as he was tabbed BIG EAST Player of the Week. Louisville junior righthander Neil Holland was named BIG EAST Pitcher of the Week. Biserta hit .550 with three home runs, three doubles and a triple to drive in 13 runs and score nine in a 4-0 week for Rutgers. In the three-game sweep at Florida International, he hit .529 with nine hits, including three home runs and three doubles and drove in 13 runs while scoring seven in the three games. In the series finale on 3/14, Biserta hit a grand slam to give Rutgers the lead late in the contest. In the series opener against FIU on 3/12, Biserta went 5-for-7 with three doubles and a home run to drive in six runs and score four in the contest. He had multiple hits in all four games on the week. Holland had another impressive week with a win and two saves as No. 10/11 Louisville went 3-1 and improved to 14-1 on the season. Holland earned a save in the Cards' mid-week win over Indiana, a win in Louisville's 6-1, 12-inning win at No. 18/17 Ole Miss on 3/12 and a save in the 10-8 series-clinching win over the Rebels on 3/14. He is 2-0 on the season with three saves and a 0.54 ERA in 16.2 innings. Holland also has 22 strikeouts, has allowed only two hits and one earned run.
Every Wednesday my school takes groups of students out and you have options where you can choose to go. The options this week where Swimming, walking and gym. I decided to go to the gym. When we got there a man had to show you around and tell you how to use the equipment, I didnt want to talk to him so I stayed with my teacher in the hall. In the gym it was very loud music and a lot of people so I didnt go in, I just stayed in the hall. Then my teacher took me for a walk for a few minutes. I am not going there next week . thanks for reading, bye.
A job I've always enjoyed is planning. In college I did the advertising and promotional planning for my school's campus movie theater, and one of my responsibilities at my old job was media planning for a variety of the firm's clients (media planning refers to deciding where and when an ad will run). In my new job I'll be doing more of the same, which is fine by me. There's just something about planning an event and then sitting back and watching it be a success that is exciting to me. I guess I've got a behind-the-scenes streak. You could make an argument that McGriff's career was all about excelling behind the scenes. Before winning the 1995 World Series as part of the Atlanta Braves, McGriff's defining achievement came in 1990, when he was traded by the Blue Jays to the Padres (with Tony Fernandez) for Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar. That was, without a doubt, one of the premier trades (if not the trade) of the early Nineties. And it wouldn't have happened without Fred McGriff.
It's that time of year … The kids have had a bad run the past couple of weeks with yet more chest infections and colds. The problem is always amplified by their chronic lung disease from being intubated for so long in NICU. A new born baby is defined as having chronic lung disease if they have been oxygen dependent on a ventilator for at least 28 days from birth. When infection gets into Max and Ella's lungs, it hits them for six, and they cough for England. In the past they've needed additional help with extra O2 when having a coughing fit, but they are getting stronger and stronger at being able to fight it on their own now. We're just grateful that we finally got the go ahead last November for their Synagis shots (palivizumab) to protect against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). RSV usually causes mild cold-like symptoms in adults and children. But it can make premature babies and children with certain other medical conditions very sick. In England, 28 per 1000 hospital admissions in children aged under 1 year are attributed to RSV each year, and in the US, about 125,000 infants are hospitalised with severe RSV infections. It is the leading cause of infant hospitalisation and is a significant problem for high-risk babies and children. Full term babies get antibodies from their mothers during pregnancy, and these help to fight RSV and other viruses. But babies born prematurely often do not get enough antibodies before birth. Each dose of the Synagis vaccine gives them enough RSV-specific antibodies to help fight RSV infection for about 30 days, but at £4,000 a course, it's not cheap! Doctors have to get special sanction from the Primary Care Trust Board to give the go ahead on every baby that needs it. Madness! Anyway, their vaccinations seem to be working at the moment as they've not had anything more than the colds/chest infections (touch wood). Sleep has obviously been a problem, and it has been a big struggle helping them to settle at night. Ella has usually been the one to have problems with sleeping, but for a few weeks now, she has been taking Vallergan (an anti-histamine with sedative properties). Seems to do be doing the trick at the moment … Think I may try some tonight!
After reading this post, I decided to check out how many heterozygote advantages actually exist out in the world. I found a PLoS ONE post about heterozygote advantages that exist in sheep, but the information was a little hard to digest. Maybe someone else can understand it. http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000125 I later found another site that explains three more examples of heterozygote advantages, including a gene that exists in flies. This gene gave flies improved viability, but it made them very weak. When a fly had a gene combination that included this viability allele and a regular allele, the fly was slightly weak but had improved viability. The advantages have outweighed the disadvantages though, so the viability allele has spread through fly populations. The site also includes information about how having one cystic fibrosis allele can prevent death from dehydration diseases like cholera. Last on the site is the debate about wether or not Tay-Sachs disease has a heterozygote advantage in preventing tuberculosis.
I'm the father of an 8 y/o boy with a learning disability. He has seen a child-psychologist and a neurologist. The neurologist saw my son when he was 6 years old and was very careful not diagnose him. He was under the impression that my son had Dyspraxia and now 2 years later the more we (my ex wife who is a family physician and I) learn on it the more we think our son has it. He is now in grade 2 but his reading and writing skills are at least 2 years behind curriculum. Our son show's no signs of hyperactivity and can concentrate very well when doing tasks such as building LEGO spaceships or Bionicles. He can sit still in front of the television and watch a program or movie for a long time. His mother has been wanting to try and put him on Ritalin in order to help his concentration at school. In light of the very latest news about Ritalin (CTV Canada AM: Tom Kennedy on rejecting Ritalin http://watch.ctv.ca/news/latest/rethinking-ritalin/#clip95418 ) I'm wondering if we really should try medication as the last option for our son and for now to really try to do classroom accommodations and try to see what we could do in order to maximize his learning. My ex also wanted to put our son on bio-feedback but I feel that he really would not understand the principles of bio-feedback at his age in order to make the best use of it. I'm just afraid that his mother might be trying to desperately seek anything that she might think might be useful for our son. I want to try to avoid the panic attacks and go methodically and slowly at what might work best for our son. Also I was wondering if Dyspraxia was a Sensory Integration Disorder. Your input would be greatly appreciated.
OMG, I would have never known that CTS was related to the spine cause I always thought it was localized to the wrists and arm. Thanks for the reference to Pain Free at Your PC by Pete Egoscu. I am pretty young right now and I don't show/feel any symptoms but I try to keep aware of these things as it would affect my career in computers in the not so distant future. Thx!
Junior right-hander Jose Macias (Bronx, N.Y.) threw a no-hitter on Monday afternoon to lead the No. 14/20 nationally ranked Franklin Pierce University baseball team to an 11-0 victory over Saint Michael's in neutral-site, non-conference play at Santaluces Sports Complex. Earlier in the day, junior third baseman Derek Ingui (Sterling, Mass.)clubbed a two-run home run as the Ravens rallied from a 4-2 deficit to defeat Nyack, 5-4. With the wins, Franklin Pierce improves to 9-1 (0-0 Northeast-10) and extends its winning streak to six games. In the second game of the day, Franklin Pierce scored the only two runs it would need in the bottom of the first inning. With two outs, junior left fielder Mike Munoz (Bronx, N.Y.) reached on a single and immediately came around to score on a double by senior right fielder Phil Hendricks (Pittsfield, Maine). Hendricks in turn scored on an RBI single by graduate student first baseman Mike Augustine (Kingston, N.Y.). Later in the game, Franklin Pierce would score three runs in the fifth, two in the sixth and four in the seventh to create the 11-0 final. Munoz knocked a two-run single in the fifth, while Ingui drove home a run with a single in the sixth. In the seventh, freshman center fielder Nick LaCroix (Grafton, Mass.) had an RBI single, freshman shortstop Dan Kemp (Sturbridge, Mass.) clubbed a run-scoring double and senior second baseman Cody Kauffman (Blue Bell, Pa.) hit an RBI single as part of the four-run inning. Meanwhile, Macias was sparkling on the mound for Franklin Pierce. He allowed only three baserunners on a first-inning error and both a hit batsman and a walk in the second. Thanks to a pickoff, he faced 29 batters, only two over the minimum, during the game, issued one walk and struck out 12. He struck out the side in order in the fifth as part of five consecutive strikeouts and later struck out five of the final eight batters of the game. It was the sixth no-hitter in Franklin Pierce history, as well as the fourth thrown by the Ravens against Division II competition. It marks the third no-hitter in four years for the Ravens and the second year in a row with a no-no for the program. Last season, Mike Adams and Kyle Vazquez combined to throw a no-hitter for Franklin Pierce at Dowling on Feb. 21. Before that, Andrew McNulty did the deed against Bloomfield on March 16, 2007. Senior right-hander Mike Robert started on the hill and took the loss (0-1) for Saint Michael's. Over 5.1 innings, he was touched up for six runs on eight hits and issued a pair of walks. In the first game of the day, Franklin Pierce found itself trailing 4-2 heading into the seventh inning. Kauffman led off the inning and started the rally off by working a walk. Ingui followed and drilled a two-run, game-tying home run, his first round-tripper of the season. Sophomore catcher Mike Dowd (East Bridgewater, Mass.) followed, was hit by a pitch and moved around to third while Munoz reached on an error. Dowd would then score the eventual game-winning run on a sacrifice fly by Hendricks. After freshman right-hander Rob Blanc (Sandy Hook, Conn.) worked a scoreless eighth inning to run his relief appearance to 2.2 shutout innings, junior right-hander Rob Nicholas (Southborough, Mass.) pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to chalk up his third save of the season. Senior right-hander Heath Wasylow (Rehoboth, Mass.) started on the hill and did not factor in the decision for Franklin Pierce in the first game. Over 5.1 innings, he allowed four runs on eight hits, did not issue a walk and struck out five. Blanc picked up the win (1-0) in relief, as he allowed three hits and one walk over his 2.2 innings. Sophomore Kevin Earlie went the distance on the mound and took the loss for Nyack. The Ravens return to the field on Tuesday, March 16, when they travel to Nova Southeastern for a non-conference contest. First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m. at NSU Baseball Complex in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
I suppose my biggest piece of advice for applying is (to the extent possible) find someone you know and trust at the institution and try to figure out exactly what they're looking for. Obviously you can't change who you are and the work you've done, but you definitely can sell it in slightly different ways. This is why I essentially had three application packages -- the material was the same, the focus was different. But, importantly, they were all true. The more this person trusts you, the more of the inside scoop they can give you. For instance, we had a robotics/ML position open (which, sadly, we had to close due to budget issues), but in talking to several ML people, they felt that they weren't sufficiently "robotics" enough; I think I was able to dissuade them of this opinion and we ended up getting a lot of excellent applicants before we shut down the slot. Related, it's hard to sell yourself across two fields. At the time I graduated, I saw myself as basically straddling NLP and ML. This can be a hard sell to make. I feel in retrospect that you're often better off picking something and really selling that aspect. From the other side of the curtain, what often happens is that you need an advocate (or two) in the department to which you're applying. If you sell yourself as an X person, you can get faculty in X behind you; if you sell yourself as a Y person, you can get faculty in Y behind you. However, if you sell yourself as a mix, the X faculty might prefer a pure X and the Y faculty might prefer a pure Y. Of course, this isn't always true: Maryland is basically looking for a combined NLP/ML person this year to compliment their existing strengths. Of course, this doesn't always hold: this is something that you should try to find out from friends at the places to which you're applying. For the application process itself, my experience here and what I've heard from most (but not all) universities is that interview decisions (who to call in) get made by a topic-specific hiring committee. This means that to get in the door, you have to appeal to the hiring committee, which is typically people in your area, if it's an area-specific call for applications. Typically your application will go to an admin, first, who will filter based on your cover letter to put you in the right basket (if there are multiple open slots) or the waste basket (for instance, if you don't have a PhD). It then goes to the hiring committee. Again, if you have a friend in the department, it's not a bad idea to let them know by email that you've applied after everything has been submitted (including letters) to make sure that you don't end up in the waste bin.
In NIPS 15, Jon Kleinberg presented some impossibility results for clustering. The idea is to specify three axioms that all clustering functions should obey and examine those axioms. Let (X,d) be a metric space (so X is a discrete set of points and d is a metric over the points of X). A clustering function F takes d as input and produces a clustering of the data. The three axioms Jon states that all clustering functions should satisfy are: Scale invariance: For all d, for all a>0, F(ad) = F(d). In other words, if I transform all my distances by scaling them uniformly, then the output of my clustering function should stay the same. Richness: The range of F is the set of all partitions. In other words, there isn't any bias that prohibits us from producing some particular partition. Consistency: Suppose F(d) gives some clustering, C. Now, modify d by shrinking distances within clusters of C and expanding distances between clusters in C. Call the new metric d'. Then F(d') = C. Kleinberg's result is that there is no function F that simultaneously satisfies all these requirements. Functions can satisfy two, but never all three. There have been a bunch of follow on papers, including one at NIPS last year and one that I just saw at UAI. If you think about these axioms a little bit, they kind of make sense. My problem is that if you think about them a lot of bit, you (or at least I) realize that they're broken. The biggest broken one is consistency, which becomes even more broken when combined with scale invariance. What I'm going to do to convince you that consistency is broken is start with some data in which there is (what I consider) a natural clustering into two clusters. I'll then apply consistency a few times to get something that (I think) should yield a different clustering. Let's start with some data. The colors are my opinion as to how the data should be clustered:
