I can't help it. I have a fascination with dogs that are larger than their owners; it makes me laugh every single time. This isn't the best photo that I took yesterday at 89th St and Park Ave. ... but I think you can see that the lady in the picture can't be much taller than five feet while her pet, standing on its hind legs, would probably be about a foot taller. She could ride him home! Jimmy Fallon ( who gave me a high five once ) and his family were asked to leave Posto Pizza (at 18th and 2nd in New York City) after they interpreted a public statement made by Fallon as a slight against their establishment -- Fallon clarified he likes the Pizza, he just felt they did not belong in the competition he was discussing because their crust is super thin as opposed to the others. Regardless, he and his family got the boot as the owners laughed and laughed. Via Jimmy Fallon's Twitter When I first started writing popular cuture I used to write "Top Ten Lists" of prominent actors' back catalogue of films. I think the first one I wrote was Tom Cruise -- as kind of a tongue-in-cheek joke I selected one of his more infamous movies as number one. This guy takes that same movie to a whole new level : (psst: I think it's The Natural . Yes, definitely The Natural .) From Mouthpiecesports via The Will Leitch Experience I have no idea if he was a comedian, but someone died in New York today. Here's the deal: I get terrible reception on my cell phone in my apartment, so, on a day like today when I have an interview to conduct, I venture over to Carl Schurz Park -- which is between the East River and East End Avenue around 87th Street. While I was there today all hell broke loose. Apparently, someone jumped into the river and a large portion of the NYPD arrived by land, sea and air. Along with the Coast Guard, FDNY and the Justice League of America. Yes, I watched. Did I feel bad? Not really. Did I feel like I was in the movie Stand by Me and was about to see Ray Brower's body? Yes. Well, they never found the body, he his apparently still floating down the East River somewhere. Here are the photos of the action before everyone got bored and went home. Hey guys: I will be tweeting my ass off about the SNL visit tonight. So, good time as ever to sign up and follow, right? FOLLOW MIKE ON TWITTER Two quick points: Carter Bays, this week, who is one of the creators of How I Met Your Mother , told Entertainment Weekly that, "At the end of the season, we will address the title of the show." Well, then. I'm not sure what to think of this. I'm sure it's just a tease but think of how many shows drop in quality after a revel (which I will go on record saying will not fully happen this season). Remember those old Burger King ads asking who Herb was? The only person who had never tried a Whopper. Remember when they revealed Herb and how successful Herb was to the Burger King franchise? Me either. Regardless, is this a good thing? Also, I'm not going to mention who, but, a certain SNL featured player -- who will forever be known in my apartment as "Most Awesome Person Ever" -- invited me to watch this upcoming Saturday's show from the writers room. And yeah, Tracy Morgan is hosting; I'm sure it will be a subdued affair. My god, this may turn out to be the greatest experience of my life. Hey, I'll be tweeting that day . (At least a couple, I've been to television tapings before; cell phones are frowned upon.) If you haven't yet: sign up and be one of my six followers ! Remember that episode of Seinfeld when Kramer mistakenly gets called into a business meeting even though he didn't actually work there. I think I may be hoping this somehow happens to me. "Hey, we need something right now ... come on, get in here, what are you waiting for?" I don't quite understand it, but yes, I'm now using Twitter . Perhaps this will be a solution to my lack of original blogging; perhaps not. Regardless, if you so choose to follow me , please do at your own risk ... I have no idea what I am doing.
