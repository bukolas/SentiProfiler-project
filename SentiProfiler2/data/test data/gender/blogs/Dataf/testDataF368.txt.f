Looking forward to the Travellers’ Tales Festival in London this week; an excellent opportunity to network with fellow travel writers and photographers. The 3-day agenda seems quite mouthwatering. Friday’s lineup includes photography and writing programmes, creative tutorials, panel discussions with editors from the UK National press as well as networking opportunities. Saturday and Sunday will bring a variety of lectures and more goodies. Will keep my nose to the ground for stories worth telling and will be on the lookout for those photographic moments. Finding unique angles and takes on one of the most photographed cities and sights in the world will be my challenge for this weekend.
