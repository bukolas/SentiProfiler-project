What a great day it was today. Yes, I went riding. I was gonna meet some friends for breakfast this morning, but Mom seemed so depressed, I thought to ask her our for breakfast. We then went exploring in her car...I found a cool new road,right here in my home town. Less than a mile from my house, it went on for about 10 miles...twist's and rises...and lots of farm land. Mom perked up. I brought her home, and pulled my bike out. Put on my leathers, my scarves, sunglasses, light gloves...and went for a ride. I checked my gas tank, half full...odd...the odometer says 36 miles. Half a tank should read around 50 miles or a bit more...mmmm ah well...get gas later. I'm in the saddle and I stop at Sycamore Shoals for the encampment going on there. That encampment reflects the 1700's. I left the Fort and headed North. I found SR 400 and headed South for a time. As I twist and turn on this road, I decide to chase a small side road called Piney Flats Road. I've never been on this road, but it is a fine road. I twisted and turned through some wonderful little hamlets and loads of farm land. I was on the Quilt Trail for NE TN. I found a couple of great barns with quilt designs on them... Stopping to photograph them, I also discover this grist mill farmstead. Got some decent pictures... Left the Mill and started to head west on another undiscovered road. I've covered thirty miles now...and forgot to get gas. I realize from the miss I now feel in the engine, I'm running out of gas. I get myself turned around so I can coast downhill toward some buildings off to the North. I got a good enough run before the gas gave out, to get me down to this place. It was some long forgotten "salvage" yard. I called my brother, he came to my rescue with a gallon of gas. I passed the time by taking pictures of the salvage yard! (My reserve don't work, it hasn't worked since 2005.) Mark came with the gallon of gas and I'm ready to go once more. It's already time to go home. I continue to head North toward home. Stopping at Green Hill Cemetary to photograph the headstones there. Most have been there since the Civil War. I'm done...and going home...thanks for coming... I've read Saxon Motorcycles got some big young guy to ride one of their bikes around some planned portion of the country. I hear they filmed it...and showed it on one of the cable channels. I'm wondering, why they don't call me, ask little ole me (5'4") to ride their bike around the country shooting photos and meeting great people who love to ride. I would be a great spokes-person for Saxon...showing how short people, females and the over 50 crowd could easily ride their bikes on long distance rides...Man...I REALLY REALLY LIKE THE SAXON. I really like Saxon Motorcycles. Of all production bikes...these bikes are my favorite! Things like scour the internet to help satisfy my craving for adventure. Things like this help. WOW...the last part...ya gotta watch what these people do! My heart would be in my mouth! I've had it with fricken WINTER.&nbsp; I'm done with snow. I'm done with the damn rain.&nbsp; I'm done with the mud, with the frozen ground...THis sucks. My optimism has dried up.&nbsp; I've nothing to say about riding, except I miss it so much.&nbsp; I've made plans for future rides.&nbsp; And tonight, the Presidents State of Nation Address is going on.&nbsp; So nothing to watch on tv. &nbsp; I swear, I'm dyin here....if not for a challenge made by a friend I would wonder, what's the point?&nbsp; These past couple weeks, I've been taking pictures and posting my pictures to a new blog.&nbsp; It's a blog that posts one picture a day.&nbsp; I am challenged to get out daily and take pictures of mundane stuff...and make it interesting.&nbsp; So I'm gonna post a few of the pictures that didn't make it to my daily blog here, while we wait for better weather.&nbsp; Sorry it's not motorcycle related...I just can't keep up the cool thoughts anymore.&nbsp; I need a long ride. Don't you? My blog is called 365 Degrees, Photos From Each Day http://chessiesphotos.wordpress.com/ Took Shrek to the Vet's office today...the bird was there...and we also went to the doggie store... OK I've also gone and visited the Veterans Admin.&nbsp; It's many acres, with a National Cemetery where our soldiers are buried...&nbsp; I took a picture of a building that boasted this strange "gargoyle" kind of thing.... Don't ya just love this shot of Buffalo Mountain shrouded in clouds? Now this next shot is one that seems to be very popular on my photo blog. I call it "Stairway To Heaven". Now this next shot is of a spring of dried flower...or I guess it's actually weed. I like this one too...it's a piece of honeycomb sitting in a Mason Jar of golden Smoky Mountain Honey. Don't it look like... ohhh ...I could beg for some of this. This building is too cool. It's in Downtown Johnson City. There are more shots of this on my photo blog. All bright and damn nice... Now this isn't going into my photo blog, cuz I took these last year. But I love em so I guess I'll show them off to you. These came from one of my most memorable rides....GOD I WANT TO RIDE NOW The wolf and the masked bandit...cute guys.... This parrot allows me to dream of the Islands...What Islands? I DON'T CARE, JUST BE SURE THEY ARE TROPICAL (Singing) Hail, Hail...the gangs all here...what the hell do we care? What the hell do we care?... Well this is about all for now. Go Check out my photoblog... Harley-Davidson reps announce trike production will be moved from Lehman Trikes, based in Spearfish, S.D., to the Springettsbury Township plant in York County. "Our decision to move trike assembly is based purely on the restructuring of Harley Davidson's York operations, which now provides the opportunity for us to build trikes in house and streamline trike assembly and distribution," says Julie Chichlowski, director of Trike Platform at Harley-Davidson. Production of trikes at the Springettsbury Township plant starts this summer, when work on 2011 models begins. It's been reported on Fox 43 out of Harrisburg PA. that Harley is recruiting about 400 "casual" workers.&nbsp; This announcement was made on the 13th, while the announcement for the in house trike builds was widely reported on January 18th. &nbsp; Harley, rather than calling back and rehiring the hundreds of worker who have been laid off over the past 12 months, invited hand picked ex-workers to come back and interview for the "casual" work slots.&nbsp; The casual worker is not entitled to any employee benefits.&nbsp; So it's not going to be any secret how they are going to save money doing the job in house.&nbsp; The Casual worker will not be able to acquire 40 hours a week, but they will receive $16.75 an hour in compensation. &nbsp; I'm happy for Harley Davidson of York.&nbsp; Some of you maybe aware, I lived in&nbsp; Lancaster County PA for about ten years.&nbsp; I'm proud HD has found a way to stay in business and recall some of the laid off workers...even if only as casual part time workers.&nbsp; I believe the labor union may have something to say about this...depends on how smart HD was in the restructuring of the company. &nbsp; I have a feeling the Union will have a hard time getting their way...most unions are pretty ineffectual these days. It's too dang cold to ride....everyone is in the grip of an arctic blast. This has been going on now for what you guys?????? TWO WEEKS? Come on already! Time to get the heat blast burning...don't you agree? In the mean time, today I took Mom's car out, there is ice on the roads around here...so I took Mom to church...and then went in search of photographs. I really didn't go to far at first...here is Mom's church! I leave the church yard and head for the covered bridge once more. This time, I don't have anybody with me checking his watch...wanting to get back home to his comfies....this time...I'm to myself, and I love it! A couple of days ago...while doing things I sometimes do without my bike, I stop to take pictures of a chrome bumper grave yard. Or perhaps I guess these guys would like to think this is simply a "resting" place until someone in the country who is rehabing an old automobile...calls as says..."Do you have a front AND rear bumper for....???" Well yes my son, we here at Elizabethton Chome have anything you desire....as long as it's a chrome bumper.... I also have been to my favorite cheese section of the grocery store in town: And finally....a brutal ice scene. I've been wondering what to do here for a couple of weeks. I haven't been on any rides that made me want to get off the bike and shoot pictures. I haven't had a camera, or it's just to darn cold/wet/icy/crappy to do any riding. It's 17 degrees outside as I write this. It's almost 1PM. I don't have a heated garage, just a car port. I went outside a bit ago, thinking I wanted to see what it would take to start the old girl up. Forget it she told me. "ARE YOU FREAKING OUT OF YOUR MIND?" I think I should have wrapped her engine in an electric blanket...kept her jugs warm, her oil from turning to sludge, her gears from shrinking, compressing, and seizing up. I should have been more thoughtful toward the old girl. She is out in the elements alone, cold, and almost forgotten. Almost forgotten?I do think of her daily. I just don't baby her. I don't even put a battery tender on her, though perhaps if I did, I wouldn't have to remember to run out and start her on the warmer days here in North East Tennessee. But if I did that, then perhaps I should just put fuel stabilizer in her fuel tank, hook her up to the tender and forget about her till it really warms up, and the rest of the regions riders are out in force? No, I think not...I think my girl will continue to be ridden when possible. I think I will continue to rush out on days when the temps are above 32 degrees shoot some starting fluid into her lungs and crank her alive...push those fluids through her belly, into her heart, her crank case...warm up those piston and gears,move those flywheels around and around, push rods shootin oil into the heads, ...smell the exhaust, revel in her sound, her smell...in the way she always comes alive for me...pleasing me...bringing me smiles and good cheer. I don't do anything really in preparation for spring. To do so would be too much planning for me. The only planning I do in the winter, geared toward my warmer weather riding, is to open the atlas, and try to figure out a route to a major ride I am planning to take. I have good intentions. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortuitously...I often forsake the routes I've chosen for something that appears to promise a better adventure. As long as it takes me in the general direction of my original ending place...and the time is not going to be a large factor, I always tend to take roads I hadn't seen on the big map. Following the smaller State Roads, County Roads, or secondary highways that just didn't make themselves plain to me while I was sitting here at home....planning. Planning? No...I think I'm actually day dreaming...filling the holes in time until I can get back on the bike and be whole again. One thing I do need to do before I spend any time on the bike is buy a tire for the rear. Dang thing is dangerous. So that's it for today...I've rolled the bike out of the carport to take pictures...dang it...I'm so cold, my fingers hurt for a while afterwards... You all be well, stay warm, enjoy your lives...I'll dream of the desert of Mojave...and I'll crank my Little Girl up a couple times a month...ride her to build her cranking power up...and bring her home under the carport to await our next ride...short as they are. &nbsp; Hi everyone, What a year it was!&nbsp; Yes, I started this blog on Jan 10, 2009.&nbsp; No followers...but loads of thoughts, ideas, and my camera. You all know I love motorcycles, writing, and riding.&nbsp; Now it's photography that is catching my attention. It was recently brought to my attention the new decade won't start till next year... so I guess my actions in 2010 will be practice for the new decade.... So here it is folks, for you, I wish for you health better than last year, wealth enough to keep your smile on and the wolves away, but most of all, I wish all of you know and have the best of any love out there....
