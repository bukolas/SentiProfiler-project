Thank God that the USA and Canada are the last bastions of the white man.  But 
they gotta stop worshiping the black man in sport.   I don't care about no Tiger 
Woods because it's the Korean in him that's the golfer, and when I watch Monday 
Night Football or the NBA?  I only watch the white players. 
It's people with pink skin like mine who invented all those things we use, so I 
claim their accomplishments as my own becaues they're pink like me. 
My pink skin must entitle me to something but I don't know what that is so far 
because I'm too lazy to look for a job.
