I admit that I fall for girls pretty easily. And that has been the cause of many of my relationship downfalls. I think that many women believe that when I open up my feelings that strongly to them that such things aren’t sincere, that this is a product of loneliness. I can’t really blame them. I too have been skeptical of such things when directed at me. And a look at the myriad of different personalities of significant others of my past and I begin to even doubt my own sincerity.

But I believe what it really is about me is that I have a tendency to look deeper into the person, to sympathize with their shortcomings, and to fall for the person that I know is in there. I feel that with an open-mind, I can grow to like or love anybody with time. Maybe that's my inner counter-culture flower child speaking. It doesn’t help my situation though. I easily make friends and lovers but I can’t keep an intimate companion for the life of me.
