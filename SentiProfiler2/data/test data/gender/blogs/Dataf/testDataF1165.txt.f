Today's menu: Pepperoni pizza, milk, baby carrots, multi-grain apple mini-crisps, fruit cup. Our first repeat meal! I strongly dislike the pizza so for me this one was a rough. I got excited by the "mini-crisps" because I thought they might be dehydrated apple slices, but unfortunately they were rice cake-like disks. I liked the baby carrots, but I asked one of my students if he ate them and he told me, "No." The fruit cup was partially frozen. I did attempt to eat it. NOTE: The second picture is a decent shot of the mini rice cakes. Also you can see the pizza in the background. It's got a glassy film on top, which is called cheese. The cheese has separated into two layers, the "saran*wrap" layer and then the under layer. Yum.
