Originally Posted by truffaut if the objective is to prove that not only Muslims can kill, massacre, loot, bomb and terrorize, then it is a rather modest objective just think in statistical terms : if we kuffar constitute 80% of the world's population, it seems to me that it would be only fair for us to account for 80% of killings, massacres, lootings, bombings and terror then you Must Concur that the Majority of the Terrorist atrocities over the World were done by the Kuffar. however threads such as these aim at proving that the proportions are somehow different.... But this objective is totally idiotic. As are all the absurd statistics involved. The Objective is to be Realistic and to identify the Real Terrorists, the Major Culprits, who happen to be the Kuffar, Not to make Excuses for them. sad that people like you are constantly dismissing them ... Evidence proves to the contrary though ...
