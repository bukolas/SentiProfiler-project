I have been losing chunks of memories. I have been experiencing it much too much lately and so I went to see a psychiatrist who told me that achalasia or my anemia could be part of it. He told me to see my primary care physician and ask him to recommend a neurologist. I am going to do it. I have an appointment to go see my Doc this afternoon. In the meantime I did some research and here is what I found. Read the entire article. Warning: You may need a medical dictionary to decipher some of the article. The following quote is just a very small bit. But it is important to read the whole thing and maybe one of you readers can tell me what you got out of it. Maybe I misunderstood it."The corollary to this is that loss of argyrophilcells may have the same clinical effect as totalneuronal fall-out."
