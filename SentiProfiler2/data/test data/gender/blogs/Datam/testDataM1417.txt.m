Ya true that she doesnt spend a lot of time with me talking but there was this magical time in the bus ride from kulu to simla,wen we actually started talking ,ill vote it as my best moment with her cannot forget that never ever,Really got to know her as a mature , a bit more stable and strong head dudette then from the rather clumsy, always cheering ,gleeful self that she seems the rest of the time... Beware she is nothing as she projects herself to be the beautifull dimpled smile can have a lot of meaning he he he .
She's got a lot of policies governing herlself but that doesnt keep her from enjoyin life to max... seriously!! she is one whose absense will dampen any group's mood.And as for ur warning against me not keeping in touch u don have to worry abt it i aint gonna do the same mistake of letting time wit u slip away as i did earlier.
Keep smiling u will always be same jayashree tat i know ,cos there is nothing where u can improve u're so perfect .... Keep smiling Rok on... U better keep in touch :)
