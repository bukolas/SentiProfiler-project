I am a volunteer at a local hospital. This started as a way for me to get hours for my nursing application. I have since completed the hours needed for that application, but I have stayed on, both as a means of experience and as a set amount of time each week that I can have freedom from the little girl and she can have independence from me. But I digress. I have much enjoyed my volunteer time, feeling both valuable and productive in the world. Today (though I did feel both those things) I experienced what I had not been missing from the working world: coworker irritation.

There is a particular clerk who has asserted himself quite clearly as superior in any circumstance he can. While it's true that he has been accepted into and been attending the nursing program that I, myself have applied for, I hardly think this qualifies him as superior. For starters, he lacks tact, compassion, and approachability, and these are not just by my own judgement. There have been instances (beginning the day I met him) that I found him less than courteous, but I'll focus on today.

I had been instructed by another clerk that I could log in to the computer system with their password, and as I had been asked to watch the desk today, I did so in order to have access to the most current patient list for incoming phone calls or visitors. When the previous clerk above returned to the desk, he proceeded to reprimand me for this in a tone that was accusatory and derogatory. I am not opposed to criticism per se, and I would certainly want someone to inform me if I should use a different method, etc. I am a volunteer and don't presume to know everything, but I am appalled at the tone and judgement of this clerk. He is just downright rude. And let's face it, I'm working for free. Doing his job. How about a little gratitude!
