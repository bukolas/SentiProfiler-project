Men and women who have excess fat deposits and loose skin in their abdomen and who find it difficult to lose the excess fat through pills, exercise and dieting opt for abdominoplasty. Women who have had multiple pregnancies and stretched abdominal muscles and skin and are unable to return to their original shape can also choose abdominoplasty.Women planning to become pregnant should not go for abdominoplasty, as the muscles in the abdomen would expand during pregnancy. People who have had any type of abdominal surgery should not opt for abdominoplasty.
