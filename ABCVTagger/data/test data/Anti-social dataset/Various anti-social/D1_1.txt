Muggings are rife ,old folks scared
murder is common, issues are flared
alcohol rampant, drugs are abused
jails full of people guilty, accused.

Shopkeepers terrified, windows are barred
faces all torn ,ripped or scarred
children are hanging around all night
facing all people ,often they fight.

Anti- social behaviour alive in our day
people are nervous and dare not say
Police are overstretched, taxes are high
does anyone care? except you and I?
