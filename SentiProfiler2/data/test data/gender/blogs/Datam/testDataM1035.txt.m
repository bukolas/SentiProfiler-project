Not everyone will encounter it, and not every soul will feel it as strongly as another soul might, but there is a period of trial that in it's depth can almost strangle us. Mother Teresa felt it acutely like a sense of abandonment from God. And others have felt it as a confusion and a deep sense of unknowing. Job encountered it when he lost everything, absolutely everything and sat naked in the ashes with his wife telling him to "Curse God and die!".

I have known some of it's sting when lonely and down I have felt like heaven is closed and my prayers are no longer heard. This is the long dark night of the soul. We are not taught of it in Sunday school where all the answers to the questions are "Jesus". We don't talk much of it in bible school where the times are good, and the friends are near. God is just around the corner and we are creeping closer all the time. But now out in the world we find it. It isolates, and hauls us off into the places where we would have never thought that we would go.
