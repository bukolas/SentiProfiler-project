My birthday seemed to forever continue this year. . . but now things seem to once again be settling down a bit. Thanks to everyone for the calls, the texts, the facebook messages, and the presents. It has been a great week!

On Tuesday night, a group of girls I know through church took me to Red Robin for dinner- YUM! One of my favorite places ever!

On Wednesday, my actual birthday, Mom and Dad had cookies delivered to my school (another YUM). The kids loved it!

That night, my friend Nephi took me to dinner at PF Changs, then on Thursday, my friend Michael took me bowling and to TGI Fridays. (No pictures :( 

On Saturday, for my actual present, Nephi got me tickets to the Travis Tritt concert down at Stateline. 
Upon taking our first picture, he discovered that the recent scratch on his face was noticeable on the picture which he did not like, so we had to take a new one. :-P
