In 1996, in Bob Cringely's documentary Triumph of the Nerds , Steve Jobs said: Picasso had a saying, he said "good artists copy, great artists steal". We have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas. Here's the video : Today, Apple's press release says: “We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We’ve decided to do something about it,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.” Apple has suffered through many patent trolls over the years, and should understand how software patents limit innovation, indeed their consistent position on supporting Open Source Codecs in HTML5 has been that they are afraid of patent lawsuits. So this action can only be seen as an attack on innovation. I wrote a post last year about Twitter theory , and presented on it too so I thought I'd compare how Google Buzz fits in with them or not. Flow Buzz is a flow but it does show an unread count, and it's in your email inbox so the implicit pressure to read is there. You're not cued to dip in and out. Also, all replies come to your main inbox, privileging them over the flow from those you chose to follow. Faces There are faces of people next to the root Buzzes, taping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads, but not by the replies, making those 'comments from strangers' even more alien. Phatic The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there, but at the launch there was much talk of Google 'hiding the irrelevant' so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine. The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially. The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the 'naked in the school lunchroom' nightmare. Following Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your Buzz in gmail and Google Profile pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in Google Contacts , but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups. The overall effect makes it feel more like a Mornington Crescent server than Twitter. I made a Mornington Crescent Buzz account; it seems to fit. Publics Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. The subtlety is that the publics are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return. Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The tragedy of the comments ensues, where annoying people can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow. This is the YouTube comments problem yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays. Mutual media By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the listening Web to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way. If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work. Small world networks Social connections are a small-world network locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse model of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed. Buzz's promise is that it builds on Activity Streams and other open standards , so it could help encourage others to do this better. Mike Arrington wrote a plea for better social software on Sunday: The online social landscape today sort of feels to me like search did in 1999. It’s a mess, but we don’t complain much about it because we don’t know there’s a better way. Everything is decentralized, and no one is working to centralize stuff. I’ve got photos on Flickr, Posterous and Facebook (and even a few on MySpace), reviews on Yelp (but movie reviews on Flixster), location on Foursquare, Loopt and Gowalla, status updates on Facebook and Twitter, and videos on YouTube. Etc. I’ve got dozens of social graphs on dozens of sites, and trying to remember which friends puts his or her pictures on which site is a huge challenge. What enabled Google to solve the search problem was a common standard for expressing pages and the links between them, so that they could index the webpages and derive a metric for which ones were more important. They didn't do this by replacing the web with a structured database that they curated, they worked with the standards in use to make sense of it. To solve the social conundrum we need the equivalent - agreed standards in widespread use so that we can generalize across sites. Fortunately, we have these. We have OpenID and OAuth for delegated login; we have XFN , other microformats and Portable Contacts for public and private people connections; we have Feeds and Activity Streams for translating social actions between sites. This enabling social infrastructure means that we'll be able to have a new generation of sites that enhance our web experience through social filtering without our connections being centralised in a single company's database. Once we get used to the experience of being able to delegate login, personal connections and activity updates, we'll look askance at developers who insist we create yet another profile and invite all our friends by email to experience their site; it'll be like a website without links. What I wanted from the iPad —a very high-pixel-density HD screen in a small device—didn't happen. But in the commentary of my techie colleagues like David , Alex and Tim , I'm seeing another disappointment. They're saying 'this isn't a computer like I grew up with'. It's not the generative machine that can be bent to our will to do anything, it's a display device. Now this is true, but it reminds me of programmers complaining about the Web, as opposed to native applications. The Web is something that started out as a display medium, but is now the platform we all expect to build our applications on, precisely because it is an abstraction that comes between us and the particular hardware our users are running. The web is an agreement on how to phrase things. The iPad picks up this agreement and delivers on it in a new form, but exceptionally well. When the iPhone was launched, I said that the web was the one standard even Steve Jobs can't ignore . This is reinforced by the iPad - it opens with web browsing, and the Book format adopted, ePub, is built on HTML. I would prefer it if anyone could distribute native apps for the iPad, but we all can create websites. The big difference the iPhone brought, and that the iPad builds on is the pervasive ability to zoom in and out easily. I think that this will lead to a change in how we think about user experience, with the deep zooming experience we are familar with from Google Maps and now Prezi becoming natural in more and more apps. The chaps at Mozilla, Christopher Blizzard and Robert O'Callahan reopened the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; debate yesterday, with a spirited defence of their decision to support only the patent-unencumbered - Ogg format and Vorbis and Theora codecs in Firefox releases as part of their HTML5 support. Now, I understand their motives here - back when I was at Apple, I spent a big chunk of time trying get permission to add support for Vorbis to QuickTime, but didn't manage to get it past Apple management's fears. However, all the browsers I use now claim to support HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; , so I thought I'd try it out. I made some simple test pages using mp3, .au and WAV files, to see how they were supported. What I found was a bit disappointing - it seems that the way that the spec is written, you can support &lt;audio&gt; but no file formats or codecs at all (my Droid does this), and if you can't play the file you're not supposed to show the fallback HTML contents This means that Firefox, Droid won't show the link to the audio file below: Looking Up From Dystopia though browsers that don't support &lt;audio&gt; at all will. Here's the markup: &lt;audio src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" controls&gt;&lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt; Looking Up From Dystopia &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt; However, if I use a direct link or an embedded &lt;iframe&gt; , Firefox will use available plugins to play the file (both Flash and QuickTime happily play mp3's). Thus using &lt;audio&gt; give me less compatibility with current browsers. On phone browsers, odder things happen - iPhone gives a clickable button for the &lt;audio&gt; , but auto-loads an &lt;iframe&gt; ; Droid ignroes iFrames, Palm Pre doesn't have &lt;audio&gt; but &lt;iframe&gt; behaves like the iPhone. Smarter behaviour with declarative audio would be nice here. -Submarine patent trolls keeping periscopes down may exist. Kevin Marks Originally uploaded by O'Reilly Conferences Last week at Web2expo I gave a 10-minute keynote on the new vocabulary needed to understand where the web is going - most of this comes from sociology and anthropology. If you've been following my blog, you'll recognise this inculdes ideas from my Twitter in Theory post, from the Flow Past Web , from one on Digital Publics and of course from the Tummler post. Here's the video: And here's the presentation, which uses Prezi 's mindmap-as-presentation software: This weekend, Adam Penenberg wrote a post at Techcrunch Let’s Kill “Viral”: It’s Time For a New Word in which, after being ridiculed by radio hosts over the title of his book 'The Viral Loop' he says: The problem, I think, is the word “viral,” which comes from biology and was retrofitted to cover the phenomenon of word-of-mouth—or on the Web, so-called “word-of-mouse”—dissemination of ideas. I propose we kill it and replace it with something better. Now this is a topic I've spoken and written about before, but I think Adam is missing the point again. As I said then, if you behave like a disease, people develop an immune system. I don't think changing the name is enough - we need to change practice too. Viruses are exploitative - they hijack normal reproduction to propagate their genes at the expense of the host. This is an accurate metaphor for the kinds of scammy social applications that Mike Arrington described in his Scamville: The Social Gaming Ecosystem Of Hell post this weekend, aimed at the same app developers I was talking to originally in 2008 . When I read Adam's interview with Caterina Fake it was obvious that Caterina's expert Tummling was key to Flickr's growth, and it didn't fit Adam's 'Viral' framing. Caterina says: But a game built for adults, where communication could come more freely, would mean the social interactions would be much more fruitful . They also have this exchange: Penenberg : There's both a good and bad side to virality. Products with viral hooks that are so strong they coerce people to sign up--in order to achieve a huge initial viral rush--are obviously bad. Not only do they alienate users, they don't lead to a sustainable business. On the good side, you have organic growth, which comes as a natural byproduct of something that spreads simply because people like it--eBay, Hot or Not, and Flickr. I can't think of an antonym for it. Fake : How about brute force growth? Penenberg : That's good. Maybe we should trademark the term. Clearly Adam is struggling with his stale metaphor here, trying to come up with better terminiology. When I mentioned this on twitter, Caterina responded with Things on the internet grow fungally, not virally. The metaphor is completely wrong. and I was a former member of the SF Mycological Society. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of mycelia, underground... Which fits perfectly with my organic reproduction metaphors. So lets keep the term 'viral' for explotatative applications that violate trust to reproduce against the interests of their hosts, and we can use organic terms like 'fruitful', or if we insist on alliterative euphony, 'virile videos', 'fertile films' and maybe even 'philoprogenitive photographs'. Almost 800 years ago in 1215, a group of Barons pinned King John down and got a written list of rights, some of which are still British Law. This week, by contrast, Baron Mandelson plans to revoke rights by government fiat. Lets compare. Magna Carta : (20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his merchandise, and a villein the implements of his husbandry, if they fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood. (38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it. (39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. (40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice. (61)[...]We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own efforts or those of a third party, anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished. Should such a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will at no time make use of it, either ourselves or through a third party. The Digital Economy Bill is not so clearly written, but: (1) This section applies if it appears to a copyright owner that— (a) a subscriber to an internet access service has infringed the owner’s copyright by means of the service; or (b) a subscriber to an internet access service has allowed another person to use the service, and that other person has infringed the owner’s copyright by means of the service. (2) The owner may make a copyright infringement report to the internet service provider who provided the internet access service if a code in force under section 124C or 124D (an “initial obligations code”) allows the owner to do so. Which sounds like it's 'own unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it' to me. 124H Obligations to limit internet access (1) The Secretary of State may at any time by order impose a technical obligation on internet service providers if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate in view of— (a) an assessment carried out or steps taken by OFCOM under section 124G; or (b) any other consideration. Not 'lawful judgement of h
s equals or by the law of the land' or 'proportional' or 'assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood', just 'any other consideration' the Secretary of State feels like. 302A Power to amend Part 1 and this Part (1) The Secretary of State may by order amend Part 1 or this Part for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet, if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur. [...] (5) The power may be exercised so as to— (a) confer a power or right or impose a duty on any person; (b) modify or remove a power, right or duty of any person; (c) require a person to pay fees. Again, the Secretary of State can make anyone do anything, or pay anything, without due process, preserving livelihood, lawful judgment. It's the exact opposite of the 'anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished' being 'null and void and we will at no time make use of it' clause. I'm not a lawyer, but I'll take the drafting of Geoffrey de Mandeville and the other 24 Barons from 1215 over Peter Mandelson and Sion Simon.
