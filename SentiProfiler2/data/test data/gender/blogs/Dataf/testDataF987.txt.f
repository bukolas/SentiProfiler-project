woke up in a bit of a grumpy mood this morning. I think because I had an absolute craptastic nights sleep due to excessive worrying and stressing over a friend in trouble at the moment, money issues, an ex that’s upset me and various other things that seem to nag and niggle at my brain when I lye down to try and sleep. It’s frustrating how at the very time you want to be relaxing, all these things start running around in your head and causing chaos. I think if anyone could actually read my thoughts they would get exhausted just listening in, I know I do. 

Isn’t it bizarre how you can be lying there doing absolutely nothing however the over thinking and analyzing leaves you feeling utterly exhausted. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier if I’m honest with myself, because I tend to care way too much about everyone and everything that is going on. Most of the time though it doesn’t effect my sleep because I make myself daydream about wonderful things which then blocks out the stress and lulls me to sleep. Lately that hasn’t been working and I’m kind of at a loss of what to do.  Last night I read for three hours straight until I finally drifted off to sleep.  If anyone has some ideas on how to help do let me know.

But anyways, on a happier note I’m really enjoying blogging. According to myspace my blog has had 70 views this week. That’s kind of cool. Pity there hasn’t been much of the way of comments because I would really love to get feed back from who ever is reading it, and from fellow lovers of all things creative. But then again I’m doing this for me, not for anyone else so either way I’m happy, it’s just a lot of fun.
