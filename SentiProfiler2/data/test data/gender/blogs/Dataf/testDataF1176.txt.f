If you lined up all the teachers and staff in my school in a search for who might possibly write a blog like this, I would be one of the last chosen. In my professional life, I don't make waves. I avoid conflict. I'm a "yes" man. I do what I'm told, but I love my job so it's not hard. In my personal life, I'm more opinionated and although I'm a deeply private person, I tell my friends and family exactly how I feel. Few coworkers have crossed over into the actual "real life friend" category. So it's very easy for me to compartmentalize. Before this project happened. Now I'm feeling majorly exposed. I could absolutely lose my job over this. In just the first ten days of school lunches I've gotten a bigger response than I expected. It makes me nervous. Most teachers do feel the same way that I do about the lunches served in the building. So that's reassuring. We've all discussed the lunches and how bad they are in passing. Then we go back to teaching. No one has done much. I'm not a hero, but I am a whistleblower. But instead of calling a "tip line," I've shouted it to thousands of people. Oops.
