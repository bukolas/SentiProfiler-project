I don't usually write reviews on products but I have to say that this is one product that actually works.  I've taken centrum and one a day vitamins without noticing any difference in how I felt.  Lavada is exactly how every article described it.  Small and potent with intimate health benefits where women need it most. I recommend Lavada to all of my girlfriends not only because its a great multivitamin, but because they support breast cancer awareness research.  It's nice to see a company that actually supports these causes.
