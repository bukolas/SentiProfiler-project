It's been a bit rough lately. With the economy in the tank and people not wanting to spend any money, I've had great hope that some places were continuing to move forward with their urban rail plans. But the opponents fight harder than ever because they see the threat or people don't plan things enough to go forward with any confidence. Just today, the list of articles that show how hard we have to keep working was a bit much for me to handle. Houston - The Mayor questions whether there is money to pay for two lines of the new five line light rail expansion in the city. Austin - The Mayor decides its not time to have a bond election to pay for a future urban rail line. Scotland - The company building Edinburgh's tram wants to delay 30 months after the rough ride they have already had. Tampa - Ballot issue for rail dead for now due to lack of decision in how much of the funding would go to the rail project. Bellevue : The city council is a bunch of morons there and don't want to run the line through a dense employment center. There is a ray of hope out there. The Mayor of Los Angeles made me feel a bit better recently when he decided that he was going to ask to get things done faster. Ask for a loan so you can save billions in construction costs and have something built for your money faster. I would like to think that is how we work in the United States. But sometimes reading all the news I do just gets so depressing. At least someone has suggested a way forward . Whether we follow it or not is up to us. Wire Feed Every year I feel like I harp on this because I think that outside of these people with fancy gowns, there are a lot of folks including press that could get there via the subway. The first year I noticed this was the year that Al Gore won for An Inconvenient Truth. It's somewhat unfortunate that people aren't hopping on to make a statement. They might even get to the show faster. February 27 2007 - An Inconvenient Truth February 22 2009 - Oscars Lame Again Wire Feed Opening up cities to new media . ~~~ Where there's a bad freeway, Norquist is trying to tear it down . ~~~ The tension between growth and saving industrial land is at the leading edge in Oakland . ~~~ Why the Lagos bashing asks Next? ~~~ Wire Feed In an attempt to go a little deeper into the previous post I went looking for more pictures of Rotterdam and Houston and found even better comparisons and interesting views than the photos I posted before. It should also be said that I don't mean to discount the devastation of war to people and property. There is a difference between choosing to build parking lots and having your life and possessions destroyed. First Rotterdam: This from scientific psychic: And this from the special collections of the Wageningen Library: Next Houston: Clearance of housing to build US59 via TexasFreeway.com , an amazing resource if you want to see how freeways were built in Texas. Also via TexasFreeway.com, a view of Houston from the same angle as the previous post's shot: This is from Aerial viewpoint . A historic shot from 1945 compared with today. Notice the freeway intrusion. Also notice the downtown getting taller. Finally, where Union Station used to be is where highway 59 rockets through on the east side of downtown and Minute Maid park now exists with a token train filled with oranges. Wire Feed More! That's the scream of merchants and others who believe that a downtown without an endless sea of parking is not worth going to. But once the whole downtown turns into a parking lot it's not really worth much anymore is it? Yet we still see the discussion of parking dominate without an eye for the destruction that it can cause a downtown if left unfettered. Before Portland's miraculous return as an urban Mecca, it too was once infested by parking. So was the city of Houston, where parking lots took over most of the downtown at one point. Via Mike Lydon &amp; Transit Miami (Via the book City Shaped) Perhaps you can say how different this is from Rotterdam after German bombing... It's unfortunate that we didn't see what we were doing to our wonderful cities in the name of cars first. Europe had war, yet we dismantled our cities in a similar way in the name of progress. So much parking though, what has that done to the city's value? What has it taken away in terms of tax revenue from land and greater employment agglomerations? A study by Anne Moudon and Dohn Wook Sohn showed that offices that were clustered had greater values than those that weren't in the Seattle region. In addition to the spending on highways that expanded our regions to their current far reaches, how much real estate value did we destoy? Greater value for downtowns was lost and in the process we saw places like Hartford, as found by Dr. Norm Garrick at UConn lose population, employment, and their character. Not just the loss from parking, but from the gutting of the city by the Interstate System. Here are some slides from Dr. Garrick showing the destruction. When he toggled through the first time, the room I was in audibly gasped for air. Hartford Pre Interstate Hartford Post Interstate So what's the damage? The amount of tax creating employment did not grow and parking spots skyrocketed. So in aggregate what did this look like? The red shows it all: Lost revenue, lost agglomeration, lost value. Will these examples teach us a lesson about too much parking? Perhaps Wire Feed Another issue with free parking. Isn't there a market based way to take care of this issue around Mockingbird Station? Wire Feed More and more I think we're going to see assessments on property owners to pay for infrastructure. This specific example comes from a Grand Boulevard in Salt Lake City moving from downtown towards the airport: The street beautification, intended to blend with the planned airport TRAX line, would include new lighting, landscaping, multipurpose sidewalks, decorative walkways, bicycle paths and public art. Of course people are going to complain about another tax, but I wish people didn't feel that everything should be provided for free. Improvements cost money. Wire Feed I'm a bit late posting this one ... One persons station access is another persons time added to the commute: This north-side resident found the light rail underwhelming—the train chugs along at street level at a modest speed, stopping 10 times, even stopping at times for traffic lights. It’s still faster to take the express bus from downtown. So it was interesting to hear a south-side community organizer speak Wednesday about working during the light-rail planning process to get precisely the things that annoyed me. “We [told transit planners] we wanted more stops and we don’t want intersections cut off,” said Yolanda Sinde , I suggest reading the rest of the post as well as it delves into gentrification and smart growth as well.
