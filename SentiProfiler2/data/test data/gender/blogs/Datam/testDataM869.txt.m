While more of a performance tweak than an actual sequel, Rock Band 2 is still the best music game on the market today. The game comes with over 80 songs on disk and 20 free songs with a special code in the instruction booklet. The game is also compatible with nearly all songs from the original Rock Band with the purchase of a minimal licensing fee. New songs are made available for download each week. The song selection is widely varied spanning multiple genres from country to black metal.
