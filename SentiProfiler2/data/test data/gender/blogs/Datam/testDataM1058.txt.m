Have you ever been in a situation that was bad for you but at the same time you could not leave? I was in that situation for almost five years. The good news is though, i got out of my situation and can now tell the world about what it was, how i got out of it, and where I am headed. 




  As this myspace shows, i was in a relationship for almost five (5) years with my now ex-girlfriend. We broke up because the love died, the relationship failed to make both of us happy, and we were left wondering with whom we were to be with in the distant future. So she left me, at first it was hard for me to accept. After being with someone for almost five years, all off a sudden its taken away from you. You begin to realize in the beginning of a long term relationship that when it ends it feels like a drug. You feel like you need THAT PERSON just to be happier. I was faced with something I had no control of. It was not like I could go buy her off the streets...no....it was over and that was it. I began to morn my loss. Until my friends and family began to morn because they felt like they lost me!!!! As soon as I realized what I was doing to them and myself I realized that I need to pull through so they could pull through. I IMMEDIATELY snapped out of mourning, and all my life energy went into being there for everyone who "couldnt do it without me" so I choose to choose life for myself first, life for them second. 


  In choosing life I realized life without her was not going to just happen I had to do some of the work. Even if that meant getting out with my friends (and making new ones if you know what I mean ;-)...) Before I started going out solely to meet someone new. We had a first (and last) date to start things off right. It didnt feel right though, you see....we started over so it was supposed to seem (and feel) like we never knew each other. But she was too comfortable around me, and made it seem like we were far from over. I was left at the end of our date thinking "so where did we end?? How are we supposed to do this??" It did not feel like we ended however my heart knew and felt otherwise. I had already done my mourning so I got over it in a sense. Our date did not make it help for this respect it just made it worse. So I decided I was done playing her games. I was not going to listen to her anymore. I was and am going to live my life the way I want to. Although I now hate her for those years wasted. There was some love there too that made it all worthwhile. Im going to remember this life lesson and use it for when I find someone else. Nothing in the world is more powerful then that. 


  The end of a long term relationship is one of the hardest things to let go of if its not good for your well-being. The lessons learned from this though will help me for when god decides to give me a girlfriend (or maybe a wife.) We all have the ability to control our destiny, sometimes though fate has the final say with or without its sense of irony.
