A while back, I wrote a post that described how trading dreams come true. Since that time, I've seen many traders fall short of their goals, and I've seen a good number find success. 
An unusual number of those that succeed do so in part because they find opportunities for mentorship. I'm not talking about the seminars, classes, and other events that offer "education" for traders. Rather, I'm describing a professional relationship in which a more senior trader models proper trading for a junior trader; offers timely feedback to the junior trader; and helps the junior trader structure his or her learning process.
