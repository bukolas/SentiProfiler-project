If you have a portable computer I'd recommend using Avast Anti-Virus with Windows Defender (install by default on Vista & Win7). Also make sure you keep update date with all system patches by using Windows Update (if using windows), or using the updater provided with Mac or Linux. You can get ClamAV for Linux, I don't really know what you could use for , I'm sure someone else could recommend for Mac :). As for a firewall I just rely on Avast (Free) to block intrusions on my laptop, normally picks them up well especially with its new silent firewall. Both Avast and ClamAV have free versions. I like the free Avast as well as it's not too intrusive in the way that it tries to advertise its paid versions unlike other AVs.
