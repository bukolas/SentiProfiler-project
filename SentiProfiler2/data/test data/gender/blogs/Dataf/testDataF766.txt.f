ve had problems in the past with contacts due to dryness and the hassle of always taking them out when I sleep.  With Acuvue Oasys soft contact lenses I've had more comfort then ever.  The dryness is gone.  I can wear them longer.  I can even sleep in them and not have to take them out every night.  I just put in drops when I wake up and I'm good for the day.  It's an ideal product for someone who is always on the go and has no energy to do anything but go to bed in the evening.  At an affordable price you can't beat them, especially when you use up a new box less often.
