I have had the honor to smell the trash bins first hand. Let me ensure you it is a pleasant way to jumpstart oneâ€™s morning. Yes we should all have the great pleasure in taking out our garbage in the morning, like good little tenants trying to stave off small vermin and cockroaches, and get hit with a wall of putrid tang nastiness. Yes we should all have that pleasure. Further, I have previously matched the stench of the rubbish bin's odoriferous emanations to the ones festering behind your own kitchen door. Though I am not a creature with specially-honed olfactory cells, I ensure you that the special brand of stench you create is unmistakable.
