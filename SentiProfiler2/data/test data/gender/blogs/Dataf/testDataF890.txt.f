Rafael Omar Hernandez jr. Can't believe how time flies by just to think that it felt just like yesterday when I found I was having a symbol of mine n omars love. I remember seeing you through that black and white screen wondering about your sex. Miss when daddy and I use to sit around talking about you. 24/7 and watch my tummy move when you'd hear daddys voice. My life has changed completely when you entered this world.my heart grew .. What I'm saying is I can't believe how much your growing I get amazed on everything you do I wanna protect you on anything and everything that can harm you. don't want my baby boy to grow to fast even though its part of life and that's the routine.. I love you mi Gordo n your always gonna be my little boy just wish I could hold time and not have it go so fast. Love to treasure every moment with you hate that daddy is away at times to witness some of the things that makes my day and puts a smile in my face. Even though your such a daddys boy I know I'm in your heart. I love you Omar jr and words can't express what you mean to Me. Your my oxygen my heart and I couldn't survive a minute without that. Youâ€™re my angel! Te quiero mucho mi vida! With love always mommy!
