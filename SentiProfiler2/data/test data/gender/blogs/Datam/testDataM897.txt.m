So, I have now seen about 9 Enterprise episodes. I am actually really enjoying this show. It does have a different feel than many of the Star Trek shows. I feel the characters are more realistic in their human reactions. We have also watched half the first season of Gary Unmarried. This is a pretty funny show. My wife says, except for his life situation, I am very much like the main character. Apparently sarcasm and a biting wit are how I communicate. No argument from me, I guess....
