Hello :) Trusting you had a safe and happy Easter. I had a few relatively relaxed days, which was nice for a change. Got to the Easter Show which was good. Classic quote of the day came from Miss 7 as we were exiting one of the pavilions & she caught sight of a display. “Bricks? What’s so artistic about bricks?”. I laughed & explained they were fruit cakes (while imagining the wrath of dozens of scorned cake makers, for whom I daresay the competition would be a highlight of the year). The display looked something like this. Image courtesy of James O’Brien. The relaxed long weekend also gave me the opportunity to update my sadly neglected Top 100 list.  I just realised yesterday was the 2nd anniversary of my first attempt at a top 100 list. So there you go. You might notice a new little button in my sidebar. I’ve never been a fan of the whole donation, buy me a beer kinda thing, but Duncan suggested it & I figured “heh, why not?”. Maybe someone out there appreciates the time that goes into the list… So without further ado:Congratulations & thanks again for your suggestions of blogs that might be eligible. You know you’ve been out of the blogosphere for a while when….. you drop into Karen’s blog to see if she’s had any luck falling pregnant yet, only to find she’s not only been pregnant - but has actually had the baby! Congratulations :) And on the downside….. you venture to read one of your favourite bloggers & a Most Awesome Chick only to find out she’s had a minor stroke. Hugs Kelley & glad to hear you’re on the mend. Dear Mr Isherwood You know today I had a really crap day. I’m sure you couldn’t care less. At the end of a long, frustrating day the last thing someone feels like is fending off spam emails like the ones you are sending. I just received the sixth copy of the emailed press release entitled “Storm Financial a case for an Australian Pecora Commission”, and all were addressed to customised condolence email addresses (which are intended to convey condolence messages to the families of deceased people).  I have come to the conclusion that you are nothing but a two bit spammer amongst the ranks of sellers of pharmaceutical products I will never have the need for and replica watches I will never buy. Furthermore these email address could only have been obtained via raking (scraping email addresses from websites). Which indicates to me one of two things. Either you are buying crap email lists from a disreputable source and couldn’t care less, or you are engaging someone to obtain these on your behalf. Frankly, I don’t particularly care which - the net effect is the same. SPAM. I responded as such to the fifth email you sent, but I’m sure it will get lost amongst a sea of abuse.
