Never bunked like he used to, cared a lot abt attendance.
After telling so much abt hari, if i don't mention abt his walk & smile-its a cardinal sin:-))
There r many fans for d way he smiles & walks. Many try 2 imitate him rather with no success. 
An ardent fan of Vijay. However worse d movie is, watches it 1st day 1st show (ena koduma sir ithu?)
Then he is a flutist & knows karate (ithelema avane sonathu, none has seen him in action)
keeps singing one song r d othr during class hours (mayb tats d reason many lecturers leave d class asap:-p)
joined a gym recently & improved his strength immensly (tat was 2 kick guys like me, i guess-was lucky nt 2 get kicked thouhgh) wears tight shirts & t shirts (u know y)
Anyway this just a glimpse of what Hari is! L try covering him, maybe later sometime
It was wonderful knowing u man:)
