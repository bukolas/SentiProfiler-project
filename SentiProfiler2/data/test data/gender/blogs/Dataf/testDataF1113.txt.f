Marisa Meltzer is the author of Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music and the co-author of How Sassy Changed My Life: A Love Letter to the Greatest Teen Magazine of All Time. She is a contributor at Slate and the Daily Beast, where she reviews books and movies, and writes about gender in popular culture.

Girl Power, which Courtney posted about a few months ago, is about the evolution of the feminist message in music during the era when Meltzer was coming of age. In the process of writing her book, Meltzer, who was a fan of Kathleen Hanna and Sleater-Kinney as a teen, travelled around the country attending music festivals, revisited the records of her youth, and even got a chance to meet and interview some of the women who made those records. But she also confesses that in order to write Girl Power, she had to watch the Spice Girls movie. Meltzer seems to have pretty much the coolest job in the world - Spice Girls movie aside.

Feministing readers who love music, movies and Sarah Haskins should check out Meltzer's archive of writing for the Daily Beast. Feministing readers who secretly love the Bring It On franchise should wait until no one's around to see their browser tabs and then go read Meltzer's analysis of the series.

And now, without further ado, the Feministing Five, with Marisa Meltzer.
