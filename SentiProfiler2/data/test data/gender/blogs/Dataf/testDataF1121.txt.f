It's always such an encouragement to see other families dealing with SID. My son (6yrs) was diagnosed with SID with speech/language delay when he was 2. We've been in heavy (and expensive) therapy since then. Before kindergarden, when we were seeing very little improvement from the OT, he was also diagnosed with ADHD. As what I felt was a last resort, we chose to try medication (a patch–Daytrana–that administers meds only when on). I was so concerned about how he would be able to function in a classroom setting. For you doctors and researchers out there, I think this is worth noting: My son's speech was pretty bad. Low understanding of language, and an often flipping of phrases–almost as if every sentence was a word scramble with conjunctions rarely used. Within 3 hours of administering his first patch, my son began talking at lightning speed, AND FULLY CORRECT! It was as if a knotted ball of string that once was his words and thoughts had been pulled straight. IT WAS AMAZING ! And he seemed to know that he was speaking correctly. He talked for about 8 hours straight. For the first time, words were coming out the way he meant them. The medication hasn't been a cure-all, but it has enabled him to focus on his work and sit still at school, follow complex instructions from parents and teachers, and helped him with social interaction. I know that's not what some of you want to hear, but I think research needs to be done on how ADHD meds can benefit SID kids.
