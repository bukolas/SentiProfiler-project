Pelosi's office said the CBO score is now expected Tuesday instead of Monday.Once they have a bill, Dems need to post it online for at least 72 hours for members to review before a vote. They could post this Monday, but more likely it'll be Tuesday. And it'll probably be continuously tweaked as the bill is examined for potential Byrd Rule challenges, CBO scoring conflicts and other rules hiccups. This is not a House rule, but rather a Democratic caucus pledge, one that has been broken in the rush to vote in the past, so it's up to the discretion of the leaders if they want to observe it. But, given that they need as much time as possible to whip votes it seems likely that the full 72 hours will be observed.
