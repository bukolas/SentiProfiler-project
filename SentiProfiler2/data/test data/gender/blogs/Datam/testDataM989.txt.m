About a month ago or so I went on trek to Sinhagar fort near Pune. I was so excited about the trek (as usual) because I had heard so much about the place. But I couldn’t make it to the fort in last five years. Well in retrospect, I must say that it was good that I didn’t go visit the place. WHY? Okay. Let me be sure that you are asking me why I think so? Please have a look at the following pictures.


But at the same time I am ashamed to share these pictures with you all. Shivaji Maharaj – a name every Indian feels proud to be associated with, one of the most clever emperors in Indian history – had never thought of this kind of treatment to his picture that too in his own territory. Well, I don’t want to exaggerate it any further. Just have a look and let me know your opinion about it.
