t is only those who believe not in the Signs of Allah, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars.” ( Al-Nahl: 105) All praise is due to Allah, and may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon all his family and companions. To proceed: Whenever we see the Mujahidoon increase their strikes against the enemies of Allah, we see the pain and suffering associated with these strikes turn to fables and false hopes floating about in the ranks of the Crusader leaders and their aides, which then take the shape of lies and fabrications which they broadcast right and left in order to hide the huge losses they are suffering on the hands of the lions of Tawheed. Since the announcement of the Islamic State of Iraq, TV channels and newspapers from time to time holler out some information that some leader of the Islamic State of Iraq has been killed or arrested. The latest piece of news was the announcement of some Iraq TV channels the Leader of the Islamic State, Sheikh Abu Omar Al-Baghdadi, may Allah protect him, has been captured. For this reason, we in the Islamic State of Iraq would like to clarify that the news announced by the apostate Qasim ‘Ata is false, and the person whose picture was aired on Iraq TV stations is not known to us at all. All that was aired in this regards was mere theatrics written by the keepers of the "Black House", played out by the media of their aides. We bring good tidings to the Islamic Ummah that the Leader of the Believers, Sheikh Abu Omar Al-Baghdadi, may Allah protect him, is well and fine. We would also like to give good tidings that victory is looming over the horizon, Allah willing, and that [the Ummah] will pulverize the throne of the enemies of Allah, whether it be through honor or humiliation – honor which Allah grants Islam, or humiliation which Allah casts upon disbelief and its adherents. And Allah is the Greatest.] “But honour, power and glory belong to Allah, His Messenger (Muhammad), and to the believers, but the hypocrites know not.” (Al-Munafiqoon:8) The Ministry of Information/ The Islamic State of Iraq Source: Al-Fajr Media Center
