I am 13 and my boyfriend is 15, we have been dating a few weeks and I've only seen him twice because he lives an hour away. I have had boyfriends before, and only kissed and made out with one and we dated for nine months. I haven't kissed my current boyfriend yet, so after I gave him a hug when I was leaving I went to give him a kiss, like a little peck but then he was going for more so I kinda backed away because I don't want to make out yet. So what do I say or do with out him getting mad or things being awkward? Please help!
