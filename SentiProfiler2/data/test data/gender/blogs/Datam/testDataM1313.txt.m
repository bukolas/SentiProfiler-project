I had a great idea a few years back: get baseball players and other celebrities to autograph my high school yearbook. How cool would it be to open your yearbook and have, amongst notes from your old friends, Fred McGriff's autograph? Or a 'Best Wishes' from Jonathan Franzen? I'm all about autographs in unexpected places. If I weren't so shy in real life I'd do it. Or at least have an autograph book, filled with neighbors and other people I've met. McGriff hit 34 home runs in the strike-shortened 1994 season. He was on pace for 48, had the season gone the full 162 games.
