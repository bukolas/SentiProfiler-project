As the company credited with practically inventing the Netbook category, it's no surprise Asus makes some of the most popular mini notebooks around. Top among these is the Eee PC 1005 series. Combining low (but not the lowest) prices with great battery life and good overall design, the 1005 has become the Netbook reference design for the entire industry.

The newest version, the $379 Eee PC 1005PE, is the first Netbook to reach our labs with Intel's new Atom N450 processor--the long-awaited sequel to the Atom N270 and N280 CPUs found in nearly every other Netbook.

This new 1005 model, thanks to the re-engineered Atom platform, is extremely efficient, and ran for more than 8 hours on our grueling battery drain test. That's extremely impressive, although the N450 was more of a mixed bag in our performance tests, beating other Netbooks in some categories, but matching or falling slightly behind in others.

Beyond that, the 1005PE eschews most of the recent trends in Netbook design, sticking with a 10-inch 1,024x600 pixel display, 1GB of RAM, and Windows 7 Starter. We've become accustomed to the high-def 1,366x768 pixel resolution screens found on 11-, 12-, and even some 10-inch Netbooks, so this lower resolution feels cramped and dated in comparison. Nvidia's Ion GPU is also becoming a go-to part for upscale Netbooks, but is not included here.

The Eee PC 1005PE definitely scores points for being the first laptop out of the gate with the new N450 CPU, and its battery life is nothing short of amazing--making this a very useful system for serious road warriors. But we would have liked to see a 1005 that was more fully upgraded across the board.
