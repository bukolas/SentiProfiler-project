You should absolutely NOT stop eating. This could result in horrible things that are far worse than getting fat. Just try not eating large portions, not buying so much junk food (or if you live with your parents, tell them not to buy much). Maybe try eating on a diet like the acai berry diet, or even just choosing healthy foods. If you eat a lot of smaller meals throughout the day, and eat very slowly, you''ll feel full faster. When you feel the temptation to eat in between a 'meal', drink water. It fills you up, and it''s very good for your body. But please, don't stop eating, you need to eat, your body needs the fats, and sugars for energy. If you stop, your body will start to actually break down your muscles for it's nutrients, and you'll turn into a living skeleton!! :) I hope I helped you, I really do!!!!!
