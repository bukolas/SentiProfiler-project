Being Back...!!! So I am back...

Though I dont know why !!!
After having deleted my approx. 15 posts I thought I did a mistake.
For the few posts were really good enough not to be created again.

Yes few people belong to the catagory :Think & Think before committing.These people do nothing much
in life.Another class consists of people like me who do things in an emotional rage and repent for long if not entire life time as to why did they commit the "unwanted" act.I am still not sure as to which class is more blemish.Well let us not dwell into that.

Time has come to look things positively.I could easily end up my entire life in cigerrate smokes.But that is not the reason I am here for."Cigerrate can ruin you", have already been proved by few fanatics.

At the end of my life I may end up with a healthy bank balance, few friends ,and few relationships that do not exist as of now.So whats the big deal...???There are lacs of men who end up like that.....Got to make a difference in my life...
Spendind time in thinking over myself and my relationship with the things around me....

Got to write about this "exile" at TI-Banglore.There is no "Bang" and no "Glore" here.I long to return
back to my friends!!
This time I wont let the blogging habit dominate me!!

Distance make people grow fonder OR out of sight out of mind.Well differnt people have just vomited what they felt about various occasins in life....Never believe or follow any such stuff strictly.Use your own natural possessions!!!
