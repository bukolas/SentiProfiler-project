Do women really have more severe arthritis than men? Are we more open or honest when answering questionnaires? Or are we just more likely to complain? Those are the questions raised for me by a research study published in the January issue of Arthritis Research and Therapy (and the many subsequent news articles written this week). It's long been known that more women develop RA than men, in fact, 70% of people with RA are women. Other gender differences have also been noted. Both men and women have relatively equal disease activity (number of joints affected), damage to joint structure and deformities. However, while men generally have a higher incidence of rheumatoid nodules, higher mortality rates, and are more likely to be RF positive; women generally are more likely to have RA, have more severe symptoms, higher erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) rates and report greater rates of functional disability and work disability. Other studies have found that men are more likely to have periods of remission. Men have also been shown to have higher response rates to biologic drugs; but on the other hand, they also have higher rates of adverse events and serious infections with those drugs.
