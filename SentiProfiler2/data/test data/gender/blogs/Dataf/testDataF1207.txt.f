The train ride was smooth. Although there was more room at the second floor, where the dining lounge could be found, I opted to stay in the lower section with Marylou. I later found out that the lower part was reserved for senior citizens and the physically incapable. But there I was with Marylou, and the train conductor checking the tickets didnâ€™t mind me at all, even when she got off at Hanford.
