His teacher told me that Adrian was “bright” and “caught on to things really quickly” two things that honestly, I thought I would never hear from a teacher about Adrian. His teacher is fabulous. I really wasn’t sure about her but now we’re so impressed and excited. She truly seems to really like Adrian, he cuddled with her when I was there and she smiled at him. She is very good at sticking with things and finding out exactly what works for Adrian no matter how long it takes. She used the word “excited” several times when describing how she felt about Adrian’s progess. Adrian is moving on to “normal” kindergarten math activities and working on some 1st grade writing stuff.
