Below is an article that I found printed in the Jerusalem Post. Please read it. It is clear that the kuffar have decide which side they are on ( Shaytan ). Why is it still so difficult for certain brothers to realise what side we are on? “O you who believe! Choose not My enemy and your enemy for allies. Do you give them friendship when they disbelieve in that truth which has come unto you..?" [TMQ. 60:1] Three Ways to Defeat Islam uday tate hUNTINGTON WV USA (14 May 2002) sumersinghrana@yahoo.com After 9/11, it has become evident that the civilized world must confront and fight Islam. Islam is the cancer and not necessarily people who follow it. We must fight it, contain it, or better yet, eradicate it. Until then we must battle Islam on three fronts. Certainly, military actions, such as those by USA, UK, Canada, and Israel are a must. The golden rule is: take it to Islamics and they will run away and hide behind women and children. Isn't it evidenced in homicidal bombings by Palestinian children and young girls? Secondly, we must fight Islam via public relations and publicity, i. e., we must win the battle in the global media. This is one battle ground where Islamics have become a bit more sophisticated recently. We must defeat them at their game by having our own dissemination of information on Islam and its true nature. That leads me to a third area of fight. We must educate the world, including Arabs and Muslims, about Islam and its violent and criminal teachings. For this purpose, please post the following URL. It is very educational, rational, and factual site. The URL is: www.freedomfaith.org. In sum, the civilized world, under the leadership of USA, UK, and Israel, must plan and execute three battle fronts to defeat Islam, better yet, eradicate it for good.
