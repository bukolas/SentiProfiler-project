those 25 minutes of my life!  hi all,
This time i am writing my blog after a long time. Its not that i was out of content. Its just that i was little busy in a lot of stuffs. But this time i am out here to tell you a story that every engineering student tells when moving out from college and being a part of corporate world. That is campus placement.
So TCS was the 1st company to visit the campus as usual. I wasn't willing to take chances so sat for the very 1st company. Aptitude test was a cake walk. 80 min 35 questions. That too all logical and quant. :) :) But people scared me so much about upper cut off that i decided to score around 70 percent to be safe from both upper and lower cut off. One could have easily attempted all 35 questions and revised the paper for at least 5 to 10 min if wanted. But there was no upper cut off this time. When results came out all those who did more than 30 questions got through. I did 26. 25 were absolutely correct and 1 was pure fluke without even solving the question.

Next was the interview. The thing for which i was most under prepared i guess. I didn't even know about revenue, goals and other details of tcs. Some people were mugging those also in the morning before going for interview. I preferred not to take any pressure and thought of going rather blank for the interview. You can think of my preparation by the fact that i took printout of my resume 3 times each time after adding or removing something in my technical skills and area of interests. One more big confusion of being overqualified for the job was already out of my mind after aptitude. Many people first advised me not to mention my all 3 projects in resume but i decided to put them on the 1st page itself. Because i was very comfortable with them. So i thought if my technical interview goes on these then i will be very comfortable. Of all the interviews posted on net that i have ever read so far had been perfect may be people write it only when it goes perfect. Even though mine wasn't a perfect one i still took some courage to write it. So now i take you to those 20 to 25 min that i spent inside the interview room and let me know how will u rate it..............
My resume and form was asked and after 3 to 4 min a lady came. She called me in. I went inside the room and closed the door behind me and sat down on chair comfortably.(good start didn't fumble i thought in my mind) and yes i greeted them good morning before sitting. There were 3 people 2 technical guys and one lady (hr) who wasn't attractive but i am used to of it being in an engineering college(There is a proverb "all good girls go to heaven and bad ones come to my school")(exceptions may be there though). They asked my name. I told. Then came the first question. Tell me about yourself. I spoke only for 2 minutes. A nice full toss i missed. ( dam me why didn't i speak much. I spoke for 5 to 6 minute when my room mate once asked me same question one day acting as interviewer. )
They tried to ease me by asking how do i feel here. About language problem and food problem they asked. I had to somewhat lie for this question and said people here also speak hindi sometimes( now how many times i have met someone speaking hindi in tamilnadu :)). i like the culture. Food and language are also not a problem. I also added here people are like this that blah blah...... I don't think i ever lied so beautifully ever before. By seeing their faces on this answer i could tell they were not south Indians as they were not overwhelmed. Then he picked my resume and turned to page 2 of it. He asked Why haven't you written Java in your programming skills(i wrote C,C++ and C#.NET). I explained that i know it but i am not very comfortable with it. So he asked 3 to 4 questions from java. Out of them 1 i couldn't answer properly but he was satisfied so moved on to what i had written in my resume. I answered every question very well except one. He asked me what is the difference between c and c++. I don't know what was going wrong with me. Again another full toss and i missed. I told only about how classes work and how structural programming works. Didn't use words like data encapsulation, inheritance etc. Then they came to area of interest in that i had written game design. He asked why have you written this. I explained him that i like computer games a lot and so i thought why not to design one by myself. So i got the chance to explain my project and what was the idea behind it and everything. I told him that i got first prize in Microsoft for this project. They asked a lot of questions on this project. All of them i answered very well.(some of them were very good exaggerated stories). They were impressed. Then he asked me what was the problem i faced in this project. I told them that as it was a strategy game i had to make it very interesting and throw a lot of challenges for players to enjoy it. Again they were impressed by my way of expressing. But one silly question i couldn't answer. My game was on bhopal gas tragedy. So he asked what was the name of the gas released in that tragedy. (f**k..... i was searching this on wikipedia one night before the interview but couldn't see because college wifi was very slow. college wifi sucks i thought.)
They saw other projects and asked some questions on them. I answered very well i believe. Finally they asked what was the thing i learned from these projects. I told them while doing these projects i realized that if we do the analysis and designing part sensibly then we can save a lot of time and work. I explained them how and this one was somewhat right also. ( some times you can speak truth also in interview :P).
So finally my technical interview was over. Now the lady who was observing me from past 15 min spoke for second time. (first she asked in between weather i do these projects by myself or are they part of curriculum. hobby projects of course :)) she asked a lot of questions about me being posted this part or that part of the country. i said i will work anywhere. I thought of saying i can work even outside India but then i thought it would be being over smart. So i kept quite. Then when everything was almost over she asked you are very soft spoken is it because of interview nervousness or you are normally like that. I fell for this one and said I am normally like that. Now she started some chin music and i couldn't have dozed those bouncers as i agreed that i am soft spoken. She said i wouldn't be able to survive in the company and take work out of other people. ( now the only thing i could have done was to hit those bouncers out of the park and that is what i did.) i explained her that how being soft spoken has helped me a lot in my life with some examples. I told her that what all i have done and how i have been part of organizing body of some events and how i have managed to win some prizes on stage performances. They asked some questions on whatever i said. ( i actually made up for that tell me about yourself by telling everything about me in this). She asked me if i faced any problem during organizing these events. I made one nice fake problem and told how i managed to solve it. ( good story in no time i was impressed by myself :P). They were also impressed thinking it to be true one. So they were happy in the end. I too was happy. I boosted every candidate on my way to exit. I never took the smile out of my face during the interview and was at high energy level. :)
So this is how my interview went. After coming out i thought it could have gone much better and i believe it was 60 to 70 percentage of what I should have done. But still if anyone gives his 60 to 70 percentage in an interview it would always be a decent shot.
Next day when after final selection i called home. ( i didn't tell anyone in home before about placement etc until i got placed ;)). Everyone at home was happy for me. My mom asked which one is the next company. I told infosys then my mom said why did you sit for this company then. You should have waited for infosys or waited until someone even better comes. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. :))
