It really was just a bag of bones on the catwalk. Young bones. Good looking bones. But bones nonetheless. Living skeletons strutting their stuff in the name of fashion.

Why is it that fashion designers use shapeless, skinny women to show off their wares. They were there in Paris Fashion Week, last week and there they will be in all the other fashion weeks in Europe, and I have no doubt it is the same in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto and anywhere else where expensive women’s designer clothes go on show.

Clothes for the rich are not, apparently, made for normal women. Women who are woman shaped, with waistlines, boobs, legs. Women like you. Not living skeletons who live on crackers and lettuce leaves.

I don’t actually know any women who look like that and, frankly, if I did I would be tempted to stuff a few good burgers into them along with several portions of fries. Ok, so its junk food but if you are that skinny you need something to bulk you out a bit.

More seriously, of course, is the fact that too many teenage girls on both sides of the Atlantic view these women as role models. They envy their status. They envy their earnings and they envy the glamour.

They don’t care about the cut-throat nature of modelling, or just how difficult it is to become a Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell or Cindy Crawford. They just see the glamour.

And if the way to a glamorous career is to be slim, so be it. And that is the trail they go down. Missing meals; an obsession with weight; starvation; even to the point of lying and cheating to conceal the fact they are not eating.  

Inevitably the result all too often is one of the slimming diseases that need medical intervention. Sadly, even that is sometimes too late and girls and young women die.

Die in the name of glamour, of being cool and slim.

Die because the fashion industry persists in showing women that are completely untypical of women who walk the streets, hold down jobs and bring up families.

It is time to celebrate real women – woman who are egg-timer shaped. Women with appetites. Women who are proud of who they are.

Which is not to say that being overweight is normal or cool either. It isn’t. We are talking about extremes here. Both are bad and both are potentially life threatening. 

I should know because I was somebody who was overweight because of giving up smoking. This week I am celebrating losing a total of 47 lbs to bring me to 210lbs – still overweight but I am getting there.

It is time to start a campaign for ordinary women. Maybe T-shirts or badges proclaiming “I am normal”. It is certainly time the fashion industry began showing normal women on the catwalk and maybe even making clothes that the girl in the street is likely to wear rather than the bizarre creations they sometimes come up with.

You must have seen them on TV.

Garments you would not be seen dead in – even at a fancy dress party. Certainly not clothes you would go to work in - not unless you want to make a name for yourself.

So let’s hope our young women find themselves new role models to admire. Women who have achieved things in life; in business; in sport and not on the catwalk.

Most of all it is time to relegate the bag of bones to the cupboard of history.

Which is where they belong.
