Sorry, kiddos, but this blog has gone the way of the dodo. We've moved the blog over to our home site at ComicFoundry.com . So click over, continue reading and update your RSS feeds. Cya there Hey all! Changes are a coming for this site. Namely that it will be defunct quite shortly as we've relaunched ComicFoundry.com . Say goodbye to the users and portfolios — as much I loved having them as part of the original site it's not really what Comic Foundry is about any more. So say hello to a streamlined site with our integrated blog, story archive and issue excerpts. You can also now buy issues of the magazine and subscriptions through the site! So head on over to the new site , update your links and update your RSS feeds. See you there! (From a story on DIY costumes in the October issue of Complex) You're all probably excited about seeing Battlestar Galactica: Razor, right? I can't wait to see a TV movie about the Pegasus crew that debuts on Nov. 24th. Really, I can't wait. That's why I was so glad that registration on this site just opened for advance screenings in select cities on Nov. 12th! The lucky cities include: • Boston • Chicago • Dallas/ Ft. Worth • Los Angeles • New York City • Philadelphia • San Francisco • Seattle Hurry and register before they're out of fraking seats. Mark Millar just posted that he got turned down for writing the Superman movie sequel because he was too associated with Marvel: Well, sadly, I'm a Marvel guy and we were surprised to find out that WB couldn't hire me for a DC property. They were incredibly nice and superbly apologetic about it, but when they discussed the matter seriously DC explained just how associated I am with Marvel Comics at the moment and it's against company policy to hire the competition. It's absolutely nothing personal. I spoke to some friends at DC and they explained this has happened with a couple of big Marvel writers in the last couple of years and I absolutely respect that. My question is: How is that different when super-DC guy Geoff Johns wrote and produced for the Blade TV series (a Marvel property)?

The first online issue, by Steve Niles and Bill Sienkiewicz, is available here . Personally, I'm not a big fan of flat art that's later animated, but I'm not going to poo poo any attempt of comics moving ahead with more progressive media ideas.
