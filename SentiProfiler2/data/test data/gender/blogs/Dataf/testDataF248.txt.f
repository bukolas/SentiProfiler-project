Yesterday was the first day of third grade for Ethan. He was very excited and we're very optimistic for the school year. He's got a great teacher and he has four friends from previous years that have been in class with him. He said he had a good day and that they were going to be learning lots of new things this year. He had a lot of fun over the summer and I also spent time working with him on his cursive and his reading comprehension. The biggest issue right now is making inferences and I plan to do some research to see if there are any techniques for helping children on the spectrum learn to make inferences and predictions. (Besides simply doing practice worksheets w/reading a questions, etc.) I'm looking for something that's more of a systematic program to help build skills for creativity, imagination, and most important: making inferences and using deductive reasoning. In other cool news, there's this nurse practioners website that likes to create various lists of internet resources for all sorts of different medical resources. They recently put out a “Top 50 Autism Support and Research Blogs” and my little blog here is listed #2 (not a ranking just a happy coincidence of listing). Check it out.
