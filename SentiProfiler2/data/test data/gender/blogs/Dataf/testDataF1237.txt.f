Should have the gallery up in a few days. Not sure how I’ll photograph Vienna since the last time I was there, every boring angle of statues, buildings, and museums was duly captured on film. Yes, the property was lavish, attention was paid to every single detail, and the staff was extraordinarily warm so trying to pick apart the hotel and keep digging for negatives when there were clearly no significant misses would be an injustice on my part – personal preferences aside.
