To start off, this thing is basic when it compares to other portable music players on the market.  It doesn't have all the thrills and frills that some portables have.  It doesn't have the video capability, it doesn't have touch screen.  What it lacks in aesthtics, it completly makes up for in funtionality, ease of use, portablilty, as well as over all relaibility.  The size first off always amazes me that something so tiny can hold so much.
