If trying to write a grammatically correct sentence in German is a huge feat in itself, (sentences that are a little more complicated than the ones in German1 or 2) speaking a grammatically correct sentence amidst all the stuttering and stammering is a whole other thing! My oral exam is in two weeks – that’s right – Zwei Woche ! Writing in german is easier because you know the rules and you have time to apply them happily, and you can make use of the famous tips they give in class ! For example, while forming questions you know that the verb goes in the beginning of the sentence and so you can write it in assertive first and then change it. Like… you have a book. Du hast ein Buch. As a question that becomes Hast du ein Buch? I know it seems really simple now, but trust me with Praesens, Praeteritum, Praesens Perfekt , Akkusativ, Dativ,Praepositionen und so weiter … es ist schwierig( difficult). But speaking has to be more spontaneous and there is obviously lesser time to process what you want to say, to search for the most appropriate word , to check the golden grammar rules. Whew! Ironically one of the methods to improve your writing and speaking skills apart from practising dialogues,Reaktionenubungen, etc… is by reading and writing more. And so, as an effort to actually write/speak at least 3 correct German sentences in a row, I am now blogging in Deutsch (or so it seems).
