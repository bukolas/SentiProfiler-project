the job entails responsibility, sacrifice and phenomenal communication skills. Being a leader comes in handy from life's smallest events, from organizing playground games in elementary school, to grand events when you're older. Some people are natural leaders, some are quiet, wise leaders, some are charismatic and others have the ability to persuade and lead people. However, these characteristics aside, I think what sets apart a good leader from a great one is vision.
