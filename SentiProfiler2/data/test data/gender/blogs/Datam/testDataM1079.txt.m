But I can still react.
Paris is Burning is not a good film. Now someone's said it; I said it right there. It's just not. Livingston grabbed a camera, threw it on her shoulder, and made sure the lens was open as a number of nonwhite, transgendered people talked and vogued. I won't get started on intentionality, but I have to say this: Jennie Livingston didn't know what she was doing!
And, believe it or not, that's part of what makes it fascinating to talk about. Because we co-sponsored the event with Honors Humanities, the night's focus was on the film's characters and culture, and (I believe) less about it as a film.
To show you why I think it's an important movie to show, but without taking a long time to elaborate, I've instead listed a literal block of film-related questions you might think about the next time you see Paris is Burning.
What kinds of contrast do the scenes of white people walking around the city provide? Does the overlayed music somehow influence the audience's reaction to these scenes? How does the film's structuring privilege certain characters, or does it at all? In what way is Dorian Corey portrayed in the film? Does this influence the audience's reaction to her? How can the audience include Corey, the lone critical voice in the film, as they consider the movie's framework? What do the white on black introductions mean for the audience's understanding of the film? Do they provide a coherent structure? How else might everything have been organized? Should audience members be concerned that Venus Xtravaganza's death seems glossed over at the end? What does that mean for how other characters are treated in the film?
