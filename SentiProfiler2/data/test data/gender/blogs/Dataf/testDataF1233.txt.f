We were at the Union Station by 6:30, an hour before the designated schedule. We walked over the counter to show my online reservation. I asked the guy manning the counter if I would have any difficulty with my luggage or if I need to check it in. He took one look at me and my bags (there was a trolley bag, a backpack, and a shoulder bag) and shrugged, “you’ll do just fine.” He also explained that there was one leg in my itinerary wherein checking in my luggage wasn’t an option, so it would be best if I would just carry them with me. Anyway, there would be baggage compartments where I could deposit my things.
