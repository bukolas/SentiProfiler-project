To me, one of the most enjoyable parts of a baseball card is not so much the player, but what's in the background of the photo. It's especially fun when an old advertisement takes a prominent spot, like this one of Bill Fahey from 1973 Topps. (In fact, 1973 Topps may contain the greatest photo backgrounds of any set, ever, but that's a topic for another post.) In plain sight to the left of Fahey there's an ad for the fine dining and cocktail options available at Harris' Imperial House in Boca Raton, Florida. The card also features an ad for Fowlkes Chevrolet, which, judging from information available on the Web, may or may not be related in some way with Mayes Chevrolet, which had been on the former Storyland Park property in Broward County, Florida (Pompano Beach: A History). Next time you're going through your cards, find a good one with a prominent ad in the background of the player photo and post a scan on The Baseball Card Blog's Facebook page. I bet we'll get a great gallery going.
