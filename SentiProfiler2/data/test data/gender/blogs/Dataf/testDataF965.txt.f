On a happier note, It's Snowing!!!! I know, I know, you think I'm crazy, and your right. Normally, around this time of year, I would be complaining about snow. I would be wining and crying about how cold it is and how much I wished it were spring. The problem is, we haven't had any good snow storms this year. If it is going to be cold there better be snow on the ground, and I don't mean a dusting of snow either. If it is going to be cold I want it to be cold and blizzarding (which apparently isn't a word). I want to curl up on my couch with a hot cocoa and watch movies all day. I want to go sledding or cross country skiing (not like I'll get off my fat but and do it, but I want the option). I want to make snow forts and throw snow balls at my husband. Unfortunately, this winter has been devoid of snow. The roads have been fine. There has been no excuse to stay indoors and do nothing (besides the "it's too cold" excuse). 

I'm sorry all you DCers, but I wish I was you right now. Life is boring here in the cold, windy, not snowy Chicago. Unfortunately, this "winter weather" we are having right now isn't even going to give us a foot of snow, so I'm out of luck this year. So, I'll take what I can get right now. Maybe next time.
