Todd Haynes, who has already mastered this genre with Far From Heaven, directs and has adapted James M Cain’s novel. Sounds intriguing — and it’s also proof of Winslet’s ability with mature roles. Crawford was 41 when she got her Oscar; Winslet is just 34.

He’s been dead for 30 years now, but Alfred Hitchcock is currently the most fashionable of all film directors.

In Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese clearly tips his fedora to Hitch repeatedly. The Ghost Writer, directed by Roman Polanski, another devotee, positively throbs with Hitchcockian suspense. On April 2, to mark the 50th anniversary of its release, Universal re-releases Hitchcock’s suspenseful horror classic Psycho.

Also released that same day is the curious Double Take, which uses archival footage of Hitchcock (mainly from the set of The Birds). This filmed essay relates a (dubious) story of a meeting with his double, and pauses to contemplate the Cold War, paranoia in modern life and TV commercials from the Sixties. Playful, elusive and mysterious, it’s directed by Belgian Johan Grimonprez. One feels Hitch would have approved.

Could silent film, like 3D, be about to enjoy a surprising comeback? It’s entirely possible. One of the spring’s coolest events is a tour of that creepy expressionist masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1919). It will be screened in 11 cities (starting in Bath tomorrow) between now and early May.

The twist is that a “re‑scoring orchestra” has composed a soundtrack, and play live at all the screenings. They sound unmistakably modern, but capture the film’s disturbing mood perfectly.   Sad news about Kate Winslet’s marriage break-up last week – yet in the wake of The Reader and Revolutionary Road, her ability to snag juicy film parts remains undimmed.

She has taken the title role in Mildred Pierce, a remake of one of the greatest “women’s pictures”, which earned Joan Crawford an Oscar in 1945. This time round, it’s a multi-part series for HBO, with Winslet cast as the single mother with huge ambitions for her ungrateful daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).
