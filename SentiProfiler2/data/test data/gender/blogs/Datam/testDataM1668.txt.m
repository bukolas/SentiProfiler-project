I like birds, especially woodpeckers and MOST especially the huge Campephilus woodpeckers.  Four years ago I started a photo group on Flickr called Ivory-billed Woodpeckers and Others in the Campephilus Genus by posting a few photos that I took of a Pale-billed Woodpecker in Belize. 

The illustrious Ivory-billed Woodpecker is a member of the genus.  There are many others too, with far smaller claims to fame, with words like Cream-backed, Crimson-crested, Magellanic, Powerful, and Robust in names that suit their unique brilliance.  Our group recently surpassed 1,000 photos contributed by many individuals - a real milestone!

Now this site becomes another way to celebrate these birds.
