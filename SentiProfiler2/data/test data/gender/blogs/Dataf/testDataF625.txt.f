Her process incorporates a mixture of traditional and modern tools as well as a blend of European and Japanese printmaking technique. She draws upon history, nature, religion, dream, and vision for inspiration. How did you get started in printmaking? I needed some more "secondary craft" credits as part of my degree requirements. Printmaking caught my eye because it was taught by Brian Shannon and I was curious about the process. Little did I know I'd be lured away from my primary craft (metals) and into the world of print. Describe where you work. I do my sketching anywhere and everywhere, I make sure to take my sketchbook whenever I might have some quiet time. Most of my carving is done in my home office on a small desk. I prefer solitude for carving and need to take periodic stretch breaks, being at home gives me plenty of other small tasks to break up the work and still feel productive. My office is a bit cluttered, with a full bookshelf, CD rack, two computers and desks, a rolling steel rack loaded with supplies, and a tank housing our pet mice. For the actual printing I'm a member of Atelier Meridian . The Atelier offers plenty of work space, several presses to chose from, and good company. What's your favorite printmaking process? Woodblock with oil-based ink. I'm particularly fond of reduction printing, though I've primarily focused on single-color prints this year. I enjoy strong solid colors and thick papers that take embossing. What's your creative process for any given print? (eg. sketch first? Pre-planned or free-form?) My process varies. My thesis, The Four Portlanders of the Apocalypse , was highly planned. I spent months developing the concept, taking photos of locations around Portland, drawing, and testing out the sizes of various elements on photocopiers. The finished designs were transferred to the blocks using carbon paper, and then I carved all four concurrently. My current series, the Iunges , has been much more free-flowing. I start directly on the block, spending time looking at the grain, then sketching the outline of the Iunge. I make a few guidelines as the carving progresses, but for the most part the details are not drawn out first. I've found this technique very liberating since woodblock tends to be a very rigid medium. What do you enjoy most about printmaking? I love being able to make two-dimensional art using three dimensional means. I've always been more comfortable with mediums that require a certain amount of force and control. Metalsmithing was actually the focus of my education and taught me a great deal about precision. Ultimately though, I found the prospect of making the same pieces of jewelry over and over again unappealing. Printmaking has the advantage of allowing the production of editions without the same level of tedium. What's your least favorite part of the process? Cutting paper and mats. It is exacting and not very exciting work. I also have trouble photographing my own work as well as I'd like to, and job that out whenever possible. What are your inspirations (other artists, people, places, events, etc.)? As a child I went through the period of fascination with dinosaurs most kids seem to go through, but then I also got into ancient Egypt, the Aztecs, Hopi and Zuni lore, and natural history. My interest in historical art and cultures has continued on through adulthood, so it can be a bit difficult to pinpoint my influences. Some of my earliest print works are clearly influenced by particular cultures, but as my work has continued the connections have become less apparent. Dream has also been a very large part of my creative life. I remember my dreams from every night, so the often non-sensible scenarios and beings I encounter within them are to me, normal. As important as rational thought is, I believe it is important to maintain a sense of wonder and awe. This will be a sad world indeed if we ever succeed in banishing all of the angels, devils, and bogeys from our minds. How has your work changed and evolved since you started? My first prints as a student were technical exercises. Not terribly creative, but very exciting to me as I could see the door to a new world of art opening up. Technically I see great improvement in my carving, even from the work I did a year ago. Familiarity with the tools and techniques of woodblock has allowed me to start experimenting more. I've been letting go of some of my rigid notions of how things "must" be, and allowed myself to work more freely. How do you get past creative slumps? When my cup of ideas runneth over, I lament my lack of time to pursue each idea fully, and sketch them out for future dry spots. When concept begins to weigh me down, I let myself just have some fun. Not every piece needs to have a deep meaning behind it. When I'm feeling a bit lost, trying out different block sizes has also proved fruitful. I followed up the largest blocks I've ever carved with the smallest I've yet carved. The transition from large to small was a fantastic mental exercise. How do you promote your work? I keep my business card in my wallet and car so I've got it to hand out any time I run into someone interested or interesting. I also apply for juried shows and send show announcements to my alma mater. Art and craft events can be good for creating visibility, and conferences have proven excellent for making professional contacts. I use Etsy, Facebook (via a fanpage and a personal page for friends), and my website. I also have a blog but I've not really set it up yet. I'm not fond of sitting down to write long entries. I much prefer sharing photos with little bites of info. Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints? Take a survey class if you can. You never know what technique you might fall in love with until you try it, and a bit of hands-on guidance can make intimidating processes more approachable. Be prepared for some failures, but don't let them stop you.

How did you get started in printmaking? Studied printmaking in college as a minor, I was a painting major. Describe where you work. I do my etching work at Pittsburgh Center for the Arts where besides teaching, I monitor the Wednesday night access studio. I do my screenprinting work at my shop, usually when the commercial work slows down a bit. What's your favourite printmaking process? Currently I'd have to say etching. What's your creative process for any given print? (eg. sketch first? Pre-planned or free-form?) I use a photo-transfer process for my etchings. Starting with a photo which I've taken, I scan it, and print it out on my laser printer, then using a solvent, transfer the toner from the paper to a zinc plate. The toner acts as a resist when the plate is etched in nitric acid. After the initial etch, traditional etching techniques such as aquatint, scraping and burnishing, etc. are used to complete the image. What do you enjoy most about printmaking? I enjoy the mystery and surprises that come about from the indirectness of the process. Acid does what it will do, and sometimes can't be controlled. However you can change it after it's done its thing and mold it that way you want. What's your least favorite part of the process? An image or a plate that refuses to work its way to completion. Happens sometimes. What are your inspirations (other artists, people, places, events, etc.)? I'm a landscape artist and I'm inspired by my visions of nature, and how we humans have interacted with it, and the effects of time and weather on natural and man-made objects. I've been inspired by the prints of Whistler. He was known as kind of a rebel in his time. He was also the first printmaker to start signing his prints in pencil. How has your work changed and evolved since you started? I like to think it's gotten better. But I think I've evolved from a straight landscape artist to one that's making more of a statement about the natural environment as well. How do you get past creative slumps? I get a bunch of plates and start beveling them. I usually try to have my next 5 to 10 images planned out in advance, so I usually don't have slumps. How do you promote your work? I sell in galleries as well as online. I must admit the social networking phenomena has been helpful in getting the word out. I think teaching helps, also I do a lot of demos and lectures for museums, and art groups as well. Getting into juried shows also helps. Anything to get your work and name visible certainly can't hurt. Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints? Try starting with monotypes, which is kind of a hybrid of painting and printmaking, then venture into one of the other processes. Take a class or two to get your feet wet.

How did you get started in printmaking? I took printmaking courses throughout college and was hooked at the start. I was introduced to German Expressionist prints early in my academic career and I still cannot get enough of the work...absolutely powerful. Describe where you work. I work in my home studio. I like to be surrounded by my tools and be able to work on my artwork at any convenient moment. I print on a Dick Blick press which I love! It is very empowering to own your own press and have the opportunity to print whenever you want! What's your favorite printmaking process? I really enjoy intaglio. There are so many techniques that can be utilized to create the final print. I enjoy charting a course on how I want my prints to look in the final stage and then implementing the steps to make it happen. It can be a very time consuming medium but is very much worth the effort in the end. What's your creative process for any given print? (eg. sketch first? Pre-planned or free-form?) I usually begin by writing down ideas that are inspired by a number of stimuli (books, nature, people watching, tv, radio). I then develop my ideas in sketches to work out compositions and subject matter. I also sketch in pen and ink to practice my mark making which I then transfer to the copper plate. An attractive quality to printmaking is in the creation of multiples, so I like to create series of works to further explore the multiple and cover my ideas from different angles. What do you enjoy most about printmaking? Pulling the first print off the press is very exciting. Even though a plate has been worked over for several hours and you have a pretty good idea of what you may get, there are always surprises revealed once the plate is inked and printed. It is really a magical moment. What's your least favorite part of the process? The process of printing an edition of several impressions can be monotonous and time consuming. I am usually at my wits end after cleaning, inking, wiping and printing five impressions of the same image. At this point I walk away, rest and approach the edition with fresh eyes because focus is needed to create a consistent edition. What are your inspirations (other artists, people, places, events, etc.)? Observation of urban and rural nature, people, video, radio and reading books always provide inspiration. Visiting museums and reading about other artist's work and methods of production is also great for fueling the creative fire. How has your work changed and evolved since you started? The quality of idea forming through observation and more playful execution of techniques has increased over the years which has really elevated my work to a more challenging place for me and hopefully the viewer. How do you get past creative slumps? I recognize them and enjoy them. I try to avoid being frustrated and understand that the well will once again fill up. I find these to be great times to look at other artists work, or just take a break and not think about art-making at all. How do you promote your work? I just recently started selling my work on Etsy! I have a website which features my finished works and a blog that I update with sketches and works in progress. I enter competitions once or twice a year and have gallery shows about once every couple of years. Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints? Printmaking can be accomplished with limited means. There are several books out there that illustrate great printmaking techniques that can be accomplished with a few household tools. There is no excuse for not printing! The best thing about prints are the multiples that you can trade for other artist's works! If you could curate a museum show of a printmaker who would you exhibit? I would love to curate a comprehensive exhibition of Goya's prints. The show would include various states of specific prints (if they exist) and original plates, tools and a reproduction of a press that he may have used. Oh yes, and there would be printmaking demonstrations throughout the duration of the exhibition. What printastic museum would you recommend other printmakers to visit? THE REMBRANDT HOUSE MUSEUM They have the MOST comprehensive collection of Rembrandt prints. The house, which Rembrandt owned for many years, has been restored to reflect how Rembrandt lived in it in the 17th century. It is a remarkable experience.

I’ve worked with companies like Marriott, Swissair, Land Rover, the Smithsonian, and Seventeen Magazine, helping to grow market share, increase revenue, and adapt to the ever-changing realities of the digital age. But we all know what they say about "all work and no play..." 
n my spare time, I explore a variety of creative pursuits, including cooking, writing, photography, and printmaking. For more than three years, I assisted classically-trained chefs in teaching recreational cooking classes at L'academie de Cuisine in Bethesda, MD. I’ve also co-authored a number of books and articles on topics ranging from online pricing and distribution models in the music industry to business use of technology, contemporary American politics, travel, and product development. For th e past few years I’ve worked with artists at Washington's Corcoran College of Art + Design to explore photography, typography and graphic design, printmaking, and drawing. I’ve earned a BA in Political Science and Spanish Language/Literature from the George Washington University and an MA in Communications from Georgetown University. HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN PRINTMAKING? Almost completely by chance, actually. I’ve worked in advertising for a long time and have been fortunate to work with extremely talented copywriters, designers, producers, and programmers. The bulk of my experience is in creating interactive and print campaigns and products for hospitality, travel, automotive, and consumer products companies in the US and Europe. And while I’ve always been co mfortable collaborating with brand managers and market researchers and account executives, I ’ve often felt that working with my design teams was harder than it needed to be . I’m not sure if this was due to my lack of hands-on design experience, not sharing the same vocabulary, some fundamental gap between left-brain and right-brain personalities. But as the guy ultimately responsible for the quality of our work , I was determined to find a way to improve my interaction with my designers. My approach was to take classes at the Corcoran College of Art + Design, everything from Photoshop and InDesign to drawing, photography, lighting design for interiors, and graphic design. A few years back I replaced a can celed class with screenprinting and was absolutely amazed by the powerful emotional and physical connection I felt in the studio . The physicality of the process, infinite opportunities to follow traditional techniques or to experiment with new approaches, the joy of creating multiples, it all had me hooked right from the start. DESCRIBE WHERE YOU WORK The bulk of my printing happens in the print studio at the Corcoran, which is in the basement of a really old, former public school building in DC. It’s a great space to learn the basics. It’s on the smaller side, so you learn quickly how to work in close quarters with other printers, how to move carefully between printers as you carry your prints to the rack, how to be aware of those moving around you with prints or pots of ink or the random sharp, pointy object. Our equipment is anything but fancy – wood and aluminum screens clamped to work tables – no cool vacuum tables or anything like that. And it certainly isn’t new – our racks and floors and tables and washout room are layered with spots and smears of ink, scratches, rust, dents – a subtle reminder that there’s history all around us, the collective creativity and sweat and effort of all the students and masters who’ve printed before us. T hat makes the space inspiring , and as cramped and frustrating as it can be , it feel s like home. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PRINTMAKING PROCESS? Screenprinting, definitely. I studied intaglio many years ago with master printer Scip Barnhart, which was really a great experience. But as much as I enjoyed the process, it's so much slower than screenprinting. And much more dependent on my ability to draw, which is probably one of my least-developed skills . So while I enjoy it, most of my intaglio work would probably be stick figures interacting with other stick figures. Screenprinting, on the other hand, well, that’s a whole different ballgame. My creative process for screenprinting is fueled in so many ways by my photography , through abstract designs or compositions in Photoshop or Illustrator, or more traditionally through non-digital processes. I’m able to envision an d create much more effectively – and I think at a higher level – through screenprinting than I would with any other process. WHAT'S YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS FOR ANY GIVEN PRINT? (EG. SKETCH FIRST? PRE-PLANNED OR FREE-FORM?) My best prints - or at least the ones I feel are the most successful - start out from my photographs. I try to travel to interesting places, though recently (thanks, economy!) those places have been much closer to home. P laces like Philadelphia , shooting well-known but very interesting places l ike Eastern State Penitentiary or Smith Island, Maryland, which is home of the many-layered Smith Island Cake . I’ll even drive for hours and hours to places like Centralia, PA, which is what’s left of an entire town destroyed by a coal mine fire. Places with history, with a unique story, with some kind of beauty and meaning. I then pul l everything into Photoshop or Illustrator to experiment with texture, tone, balance, all the little t weaks needed to pull together an exciting composition. Sometimes there’s a lot of manipulation involved, as with my print “El Gran Gallo,” where the original photograph is substantially transformed into a graphic print. Other times the digital work is very minimal, as with “ Gull , ” where Photoshop was used merely to create CMYK separations, the print clearly reflecting its photographic origins. Finally, it's into the studio, where I try to challenge mysel f with each new project, working with new color palettes, techniques that are new and unusual, or sizes or aspect ratios that I haven't worked with before. WHAT DO YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT PRINTMAKING? The night before I go into the studio I'll spend some time doing a mental walk-through of my battle plan, about everything that needs to be done, about the best timing, order, where things can go wrong. I try to anticipate problems and how to keep them from happening. So by the time I get into the studio, I have a fairly good idea of what needs to happen, when, and how I can act and react if anything funky happens. What I love about printmaking, then, is when I get into the studio and the day unfolds much like I've visualized it. I'm in the zone, everything is breaking my way. My film looks just like I want it, the emulsion isn't too old and is holding the detail of my images nicely. There's plenty of room to work, I'm getting my inks together without much hassle. And when the printing begins, it's almost on automatic, pour, flood, drop, pull, lift, flood, repeat. I spin gingerly on one foot and carry my prints to the rack, the other printers in the studio moving deftly aside as I scoot by. There's a harmony, a synchronicity between us. My head's down, I'm doing good work, the rhythm and pacing are spot on. Can’t get enough of that feeling. WHAT'S YOUR LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THE PROCESS? I hate picking colors for my prints. I am woefully unschooled in color theory, though I do generally know a good color combination when I see one. But my knowledge and skill in this area are very rough, unrefined. I’m certainly not delicate when it comes to color, and often default to bold colors because I just don’t trust myself outside of this comfort zone . I've been aching to take a color theory class for years, but haven’t had any luck so far . Fortunately my instructors Manuel Navarette and Carolyn Hartmann have been extremely gracious in sharing little color theory insights with me , suggesting better combinations or directions for particular projects. But I'd very much l ike to take color theory so I can embrace this part of the process more fully, make it more my own. WHAT ARE YOUR INSPIRATIONS (OTHER ARTISTS, PEOPLE, PLACES, EVENTS, ETC.)? In the last 15 years or so, there are three artists who have really inspired me to embrace artistic pursuits. First is Scip Barnhart , my intaglio instructor , who gave me my first taste of the technical skill and creative processes required to create something meaningful, beautiful, fulfilling. More recently are two New Orleans artists, Matt Rinard and Robert Guthrie . I've been collecting their work for years and have been surrounded at home by their prints and originals and bits of sculpture. Each time I catch a glimpse of their work , some little emotional part of me think s fondly of New Orleans and an overwhelming sense of happiness wash es over me. L et me make it clear that I'm absolutely in no way comparing my work to the awesomeness these guys create, but knowing how happy their art makes me, I thought it would be really, amazingly cool to see if I could find something within m e , some creativity, some passion, that could give a bit of that happiness to others. And it goes without saying that I’d be absolutely nowhere in any of this without the attention, support, and dedication of my instructors Carolyn and Manuel. HOW HAS YOUR WORK CHANGED AND EVOLVED SINCE YOU STARTED? It’s important to understand that when I walked into the studio that very first day, I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. None. Yeah, I’d had that intaglio experience with Scip years earlier, but wow, such a different process, diff erent tools, different mindset. So I was really starting from scratch. My first year or so was spent focused on the basics, developing the muscle memory of the right way to pull the squeegee across my screen, developing a fluidity of movement in my personal printing process, becoming familiar with the temperament of the inks and acrylic base, how they change based on environmental circumstances, how to coax them into doing what I want them to do with a little bit of airbrush cleaner. My prints in this time were very traditional, straightforward examples, pretty much just ink on paper. But throughout that first year, I did two important things. First, I asked questions, a lot of questions. I’m sure I drove my instructors a little nuts. Second, I searched bookstores and galleries and the internet for more information on screenprinting , but also generally about all types of printmaking. So over the course of that year, I learned, for example, about metallic powders and glass beads and me coflock and the use of adhesives. I learned about very interesting techniques using wax and oil paint to a d d depth and dimension to my prints. I discovered how important it can be to pick the right paper for an edition, because some papers simply won’t accommodate an artist’s vision for a particular project. I also developed a sense of the projects I should (and shouldn’t) be tackling. My dad was an artist, and I thought it would be a neat homage to his work to create a print of one of his paintings. It was hard as hell, to be honest. Not only technically, because perhaps my skills with Photoshop and as a printmaker weren’t quite yet up to that level of reproduction, but also emotionally because I was putting lots of pressure on myself to do justice to the original piece. Add to that some difficulties with new inks that I was using, and a few other hiccups, and we had the recipe for one spectacular, colossal failure. I still think it’s a good idea to challenge yourself, obviously, but perhaps I’d piled on too many expectations, too much pressure. I’ve found that I work better and am much more satisfied when I’m focused on my personal vision for my pieces, with their genesis in my photography or drawing or whatnot, because I only need to be true to myself, my vision, my creativity. In the past few years, all of this learning, experimentation, successes and failures have definitely influenced my work , changed it – I think – for the better . As much as I still love the straightforward ink-on-paper approach, I’ve also embraced some less traditional processes. Images that are c on c ealed by 15 or more layers of multi-colored inks, then sanded to carefully reveal parts of the obscured subject. Images printed in clear acrylic base, with acrylic glazes or wax and oil paints used to provide color, depth, dimension. All this experimentation comes at a price, though. If I’d been sticking to simpler projects using more basic skills, I’d have a much broader, deeper portfolio by now. Instead, I have a handful of finished editions that I love, combined with drawers and portfolios full of pieces in various stages of completion: waiting to be sanded, waiting for an epiphany to recover from an experimental misstep, pieces that I’m just not sure how to finish. I’m okay with that trade-off, because it’s my belief that I need to spend a whole bunch of years up front working on technique so that later on I can print larger editions, more complicated editions flawlessly and with (relative) ease. HOW DO YOU GET PAST CREATIVE SLUMPS? Check back with me in a few years, I’m still trying to figure that out! I've definitely hit a few walls so far. One way I’ve attacked t he problem of becoming frustrated with my skills development is by changing instructors. Which is absolutely not a knock on one instructor or another, but I think it's important to learn from different people, to be pushed and encouraged and challenged by people with unique perspectives, paths, approaches. When I get stuck creatively, in terms of what I am going to do next, it’s sometimes good to just be in the studio printing, even if I’m not working on my next masterpiece. Because I have a day job, my studio time is very limited. And I often find myself trying to maximize my productivity by printing complicated pieces, sometimes with funky techniques or levels of detail that maybe , maybe I shouldn’t be embracing quite yet. And when things don't work out exactly as I'd planned, I'm especially hard on myself. So lots of practice, especially with less meaningful subject matter, is key. Get in the studio and just print some squares or squiggles, but aim to make all the right choices: paper, composition, colors, technique, bringing everything together so you print the best darn squiggles you can. HOW DO YOU PROMOTE YOUR WORK? I'm just st arting to figure that out . Like I said, most of my best prints start out as my photographs. "El Gran Gallo" is an interpretation of a picture I made of a rooster at the Great Frederick Fair in Frederick, MD, which lent itself to a particularly cool transformation into a graphic print . But sometimes my photos just need to live as photos. So if you visit my E tsy shop or flickr photostream, you'll see I have photos as well as prints available. My approach so far has been very basic: have a bit of a presence on my personal site , post photos and prints to flickr and to lots of flickr groups , and try selling some pieces on E tsy. It's frustrating, I don't yet have a good sense of where best to promote my work, or how to best price my photos and prints. I don't want to overcharge, but I also don't want to low-ball. After all, camera lenses and studio time don't come cheap. Other printmakers at my studio say they've had good success on eBay, but honestly, a 12% cut of a sale seems a little excessive to me. Maybe that’s penny-wise and pound-foolish , I don’t know . I'm also starting to explore print exchanges and submitting my work to shows, but I don't yet have a sense of the return that will have for me. Right now I’m just throw ing everything against the wall to see what sticks. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR ADVICE FOR OTHERS WHO WANT TO TRY MAKING HAND-PULLED PRINTS? Trust your gut. Whether it’s screenprinting or intaglio or litho, you’re going to know when you’ve found a process that’s a good fit for you. Struggling is part of the technical and creative learning process, so you shouldn’t use a little difficulty up front as an excuse to give up. But there’s certainly a difference between becoming proficient with a particular process and discovering you have a passion for it.
