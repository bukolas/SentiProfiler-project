Â Today's menu: peanut butter and jelly graham cracker sandwich, apple juice, fruit cup (peaches), milk I could barely eat this meal so I didn't. And then I was deliriously ravenous driving to get my little one. And then it got worse. I got sick when I got home. I can't say what exactly did it. Whether it was the lunch (I ate only half of one sandwich) or the not eating enough (also family history of vertigo) or taking a vitamin towards the end of the day without much in my stomach or just plain getting sick.... I feel better now. I probably didn't eat enough. You know, I think I'm going to pack a lunch for tomorrow. In general I don't look at the lunch menu for a extra "surprise," but I can't do it after this night in the bathroom. I can't make my husband do all the work two nights in a row. Until I feel better I'm doing the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) and I'm sure none of those foods are on the menu. I noticed a LOT of kids with packed lunches today. Maybe they knew something I didn't. *** Earlier in the day I asked the kids what they thought of the lunch. Some ate it and said they thought it was "good." A couple kids did not eat it. Tons of packed lunches though. Maybe 20%? Trust me, that's a lot. I asked a couple kids if they ate the peaches and they looked at me strangely and said, "no." I don't think they even opened the packages. *** I took a photo of the nutritional facts. Each sandwich was 318 calories. Because the other food items haven't listed the calories, I never knew. Looking at the calories made it hard for me to choke this one down.
