For those thinking about long-term travel, this is a great "how to" guide that will help you with the process. For those who prefer to live vicariously through other people's travels, this book is just one more way for you to enjoy yourself. Either way, you should check it out at www.aroundtheworldineasyways.com. Once there, you will discover a blog feature on this site and it is here where I will continue to blog. So come visit my new site and if you have particular ideas of what you would like me to blog about, leave a comment on a blog post or send me an email via Contact the Author. I would love to hear from you.
