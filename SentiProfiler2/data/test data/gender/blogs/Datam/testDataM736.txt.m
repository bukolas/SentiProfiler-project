Are you like me? Unsure? Read on, and find out! Are you tired of all these self proclaimed self help books that discourage you from living in fear? Are you tired of being told that going out, doing things, and meeting real people, is for some reason, objectively better than your natural inclination to stay in every night? Are you tired of being made to feel like your desire to never leave the house again is wrong? Did you answer yes to one or more of these questions, but are afraid to admit to people that this is how you really feel? If so, good news! You are like me! And it truly is great news, because I've written just the book for me. Since also you're just like me, it's almost like you wrote this book, for you ! It's kind of sad that we're pioneering new ground in the "self help" industry by putting the "self" back in "self help". But hey, let them worry about it. I've entitled the book "I'm Afraid I'll Stay the Way I Am, Thank You Very Much" and between its' covers, you'll find all sorts of words, which I have arranged in a specific fashion,to empirically and conclusively demonstrate that what we may loosely define as "mental illness" is a quality to not only be embraced, but celebrated. I invite you to journey with me, from the first page to the last, and bear witness as I dispel some of the age old myths like -Real friends are better than imaginary ones -Healthy love involves at least two people -Talking is more than just noise -There's no reason to be afraid of spiders -A penny earned is a penny saved In addition, I will show you several secret techniques on how to: -Build a working E-meter -Construct an 'anxiety free zone' in the comfort of your own home, using only string and a pair of safety scissors -Take out your frustrations over your own ineptitude on moderately relevant acquaintances in meticulous plotted attacks -Instigate mass hysteria Listen. The only way they can keep you down is if you're playing their game. So do yourself a favor and stop it. Make your own game and play it instead. There's no reason that you should be afraid to be yourself. Fear change instead... it's way scarier. HI HI HI it is your old frend Joachim Jaeger here to make your new years with even more smiles. I am to be tasked with updating of this blog for entire year of 20 08, so let see how it go! Today It is wensday and that is meaning comics books day of the week. This week is very special comics books day because it is meaning Hulk #1 is for sale!!! Yes friends the hulk is return but all new, different than previous. Now hulk is red. yes red, like the colour you see. It is similar to orange, but not quite as yellow. What could happen to make such strange circumstance, you ask? It is fortunate you wonder on this for all you shall find here is solutions to your own imaginings. And it is this. The hulk is not the hulk. Brace Bannerman is locked up in arrmys aquarium. So who is to be this new hulk who burns with the fires of a thousand chernobyls? It is shitbag, rick jones. They dont SAY, but they say. It is mystery but I solve, okay? Overall, i do not buy.

Since all possible types of fancy eggs were listed, this is the subject about which the most is known. However, it was decided, at the last minute, that the categories would be arranged for an aesthetic sense of "most to least", rather than another arrangement based on some meaningful or informative criteria.
