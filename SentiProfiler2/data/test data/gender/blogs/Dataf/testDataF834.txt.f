As the name suggests, melanoma occurs in the melanocytes cells. Melanocytes contain a substance called melanin that are responsible for skin pigmentation (skin color) and also help protect the skin against the UV rays of the sun. When you go out in the sun, the melanocytes produce more melanin for protection and thus the skin gets tanned. Melanocytes sometime mutate faster than other normal skin cells; as a result, they accumulate together and form tumors. Malignant tumors can also affect the healthy tissues and further give rise to new tumors in the body.
