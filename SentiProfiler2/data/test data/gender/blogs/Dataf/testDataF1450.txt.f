so i've come to the dark side. well not really but i've bought my first dc comic. and anyone who knows me will tell you that i'm a marvel girl all the way. well i have gone and bought power girl. and i must say that i love it! it's really well written. the only thing i don't like is that they draw her with really big boobs. i mean really big boobs. but other then that, i really like the comic. it is on it's 10th issue this month and i would really suggest everyone to go out and read it. for once there's a good female comic. they give her attitude and don't make her this dumb blonde. she can defend herself and she has some spunk to her. she looks good but man she has some punch behind her. so i guess i'm kicked out of the marvel club house (i have borrowed that statement from the nerdy bird) but i'm ok with that. power girl is a good read.
