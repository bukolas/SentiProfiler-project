commercialized us!!!! How many of us in today's world have time to think just for a second how commercialized the world has become or rather we have become? Are v now what we really wanted to be? Are we synchronized with what we have studied and what we are doing?Let me place myself as an example. I have studied electronics and instrumentation but i am sitting for placements for a software company. Ok lets say thats what life is. But when we know thats what life is then why do we have many other options other than comp.science and the IT??? If what everybody wants is money then yes software is the right field but 10 years from now where would u get ur computers if u r programming down der? Who would teach ur children if ur friends are along with u?? Everybody wants the IITs and IIMs but how many of them work for INDIA?? Friends just sit back and think where did your journey start what was YOUR goal are u reaching for the one u started ur journey?? Many of us think our aim is to earn and keep the family happy. But how many of us are happy in the process. A family always supports what you do if it is right. A happy mind is necessary to keep the family happy right? Job satisfaction is most important i feel rather than money. But very few would agree with me because the world is like that. Comp.science students no hard feelings. This blog is dedicated to all the hardware STUDENTS. I would say ENGINEERS coz i dont know how many of us will really work as hardware engineers.
