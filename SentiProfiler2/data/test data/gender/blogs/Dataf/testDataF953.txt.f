Father and Grandmother are coming back from the Univ hospital. They wanted to donate their body after their death and they were in hospital.
Actually I felt complicated about it in my mind. We had no choice. It's their decision. We had to succeed their will whatever.

Father was incredible man. I’m really proud of him. 
He was tough, laid back and warm-hearted. 

He worked for Japan defending air force and was placed at Okinawa base alone at a time. I was at the age of puberty and avoided seeing and talking with him. When I got my ears pierced in my high school, teachers had warned strongly and asked stopping cuz such attitude was against the moral of the school then bothered other students. Mother also nagged me and slapped my cheek hearing from them; however, Father was on my side. 
He said "it doesn't make sense your behavior makes other students annoyed. it's too conservative. A thing for only sure is that you hurt your ears by yourself. You just have responsibility for yourself." I've never forget it and I won't.  
He was really really great man.
I've spent whole spare time with him at his end of a year following him anywhere it's even rugby school. He loved rugby and I figured out he encouraged many kids to be just as they are. At the same time he took a note small things like A could pass the ball to B etc. then he gave kids their possibility and complement. It made them fun to play rugby. 
He changed much.
When I was in Canada a few years ago, he had written to me to say sorry cuz he was strict during my childhood.  
He had a second thought about the way to raise children while he was coaching kids to play rugby.
He was thoughtful, changeable and modest. 
Anyway, I miss father so much. Then I want to give him my appreciation and apology for much thing.

I can't help crying. I imagine he would try to act, fight and tackle like playing rugby in the next life.  I'm sure.
Then he always keeps watching me. I'm sure. 

I'm sorry that I couldn't see his body burned.
 
Can I say that? Dad was given the medal by the Emperor but I'm sure he wouldn't feel nice but must've been happy 30 kids’s visiting him at the day of his death. 

When he was diagnosed cancer, he had reported to his friend he was happy for getting cancer cuz his 3 children came back to him. After his death when I found such an e-mail I couldn't help laughing and shedding my tears. How funny it is!! Right?

My best friend told me that only good memory would be left in my mind in the future. I wish I would. Mostly I feel like that. That's why I feel sad. I hope we talk about him smiling with my family left. 

It's kinda my mourning work.
