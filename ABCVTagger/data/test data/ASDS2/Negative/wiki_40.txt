History

Subang Jaya was originally a township of Petaling Jaya. However, due to the high amount of population and fast rising developments, it has earned its own municipality[citation needed], the Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya. The city was developed by Sime UEP Berhad, the property development arm of the Malaysian conglomerate Sime Darby. The site was formerly an oil palm plantation called Seafield Estate under the municipality of Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya. Construction work for the development of Subang Jaya began in 1974 and was concluded in 1988. Upon the completion of Subang Jaya on the same year, Sime UEP began clearing land for the development of UEP Subang Jaya.[citation needed]

In 1997, Subang Jaya was granted the status of a municipality.[citation needed] Hence, the local authority was transferred from the Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya (MPPJ) (Petaling Jaya Municipal Council) to Majlis Perbandaran Subang Jaya (MPSJ) (Subang Jaya Municipal Council). The MPSJ holds local government authority not only in Subang Jaya, but also USJ, Putra Heights, Batu Tiga, Bandar Sunway, Puchong, Bandar Kinrara, Seri Kembangan, Balakong, and other parts of Petaling district.

In 2005, Subang Jaya experienced a significant rise in dengue cases. [2]

On 28 September 2011, a major explosion occurred at Empire Subang in SS16 at 3:45am. The fire department suspected that the explosion was caused by a gas leakage. [3] Four people were injured. [4]
