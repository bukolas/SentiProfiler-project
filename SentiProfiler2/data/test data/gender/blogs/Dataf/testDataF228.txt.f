Next week begins the 2010 Human Capital Summit in Arizona; here's sneak peek at some of the things I'm most looking forward to!  Remember, Joy, Amy and I will be live blogging (www.hci.org) throughout the event for all members who can't join us in-person.

Also, as an industry first we are providing our keynote presentations globally via video webcast for you to access live. While there is no substitute for the networking and peer to peer collaboration that happens at live events, budgets are tight and travel has been reduced fore many. Register here!

Monday will be the kick off, with welcome remarks by Michael Foster, Chairman and CEO, Human Capital Institute and  Michael Gregoire, Chairman and CEO, Taleo.  Next up we can't wait to hear from Geoff Colvin, author of Talent is Overrated, as he discusses "The Upside of the Downturn".  The session view is that top performing leaders reject the common view that slashing costs and firing employees are all that matter in tough times. They see downturns as rich opportunities to reinvent their organization and lay the groundwork for future growth. What a way to kick off the Summit!

I'm also really interested in the next two speakers, Blake Mycoskie, CEO, TOMS Shoes and Jim Carroll, International Futurist, Trends & Innovation Expert, Author of Surviving the Information Age.  Their sessions are titled The New Rules for Tomorrow's Business: Moving Towards Passion vs. Payoff and 7 Things You Need To Do Right Now: Aligning the Fast Future to Your Current Strategy .  I like that all of these sessions have a great "forward moving" feel-- let's get past the downturn and look at what human capital can be doing to build for a great tomorrow.

I'm going to stop there on discussing sessions because there are over 50 great meetings and you can read about them right after they happen in my blog. Looking forward as well to lots of time to network and reconnect with HCI members-- and of course for the Around the World Wine and Tequila Tasting.

See you in Arizona!
