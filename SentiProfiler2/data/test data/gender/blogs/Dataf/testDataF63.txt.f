looking back…  It's been a year since my life changed for the better...since i joined Art of living...Life has never been the same...Life has been a celebration ever since...I did my basic course last May.Still remember the last day of the course.it was drizzling whn i was returning home.I kept singing 'Jai jai radha raman' on may back...the raindrops falling on my face...the world never seemed more beautiful!!! The very next month i was lucky enough to do advance course with Meghal bhaiya. those days of silence are amongst the most beautiful days of my life.Also i met some really wonderful people there who have become real good friends now.There's no looking back since then.so many courses with so many amazing teachers....new experiences,new learnings...and with each course,life takes a new turn.It's been a wonderful journey so far which has enriched me in terms of knowledge,spirituality and even my daily interactions with others.One year of bliss and what better way to celebrate the anniversary than an advance course with Guruji himself !!! Am on my way to ashram next week for advance course in the divine presence of Guruji.It's my first visit to ashram and am so excited about it :)
P.S -Life is nothing to be very serious about. Life is a ball in your hands to play with. Don't hold on to the ball. —Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
