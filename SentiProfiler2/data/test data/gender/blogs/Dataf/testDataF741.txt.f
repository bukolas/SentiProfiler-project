By April 1st...I will be living in Houston, Tx. I never liked change but I am embracing it. I know God needed to get my attention. I was doing things my way, not reading my bible, not calling my mom, and just completely disconnected from God. Me and my life were simply a MESS!!! Within a month...I finalized my divorce, got fired from my job, found myself in-between apartments, AND gained 6 pounds!!!
