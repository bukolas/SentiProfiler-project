Having to deal with the Fall weather isn't just limited to the rainy season and the onset of cold weather. It also brings with it a lot of wind, which will pick up the dust, and virtually fling it at your eyes. It is very similar to walking during the summer and having specks of pollen get into your eyes. The discomfort is enough to drive you crazy every time, and anyone who has even had something in their eye knows the feeling all too well. When this happens, you run the risk of scratching your eye if you are not careful on how you deal with it.
