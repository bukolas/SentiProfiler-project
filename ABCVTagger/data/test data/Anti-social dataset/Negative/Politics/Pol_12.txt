I appreciate the action taken by the commissioner in instituting an inquiry, and, although we have not yet had an opportunity to study the report, in no way do I criticise the conclusion that was reached and the action that was taken. However, does not the right hon. Gentleman feel that, in view of the growing public disquiet about such incidents, he should state explicitly, on behalf of the Government, his view that incidents of this nature should henceforth be the subject of an independent inquiry?
I have said that we are looking into the police complaints inquiry procedure. However, I still maintain that this particular inquiry was extremely detailed and, in its criticisms of various aspects of the conduct of the operation, extremely frank.
