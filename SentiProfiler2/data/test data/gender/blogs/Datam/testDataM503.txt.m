The 72 hours run out from when the bill is posted online. Now, as to what they'll be voting upon. As Kate points out TNR's Jon Cohn outlined three possibilities on Saturday. On Sunday, the White House declared its preference for options one or two when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declared on Fox News Sunday, “We'll have the votes when the House votes, I think within the next week. And I think whoever sits here this time next week, you all will be talking about health care reform not as a presidential proposal but as something that will soon be the law of the land.” In other words: they don't want to wait for the Senate to act – which would take another week minimum. They want President Obama to sign a bill into law before he leaves for Indonesia and Australia – this is, after all, why he postponed his trip. So this leaves us with options one and two. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is doing her best to save her members from one – a vote directly on the Senate bill – as she doesn't want to further burden them with all the Senate sweetheart deals that are going to be stripped out in reconciliation any way. Which leaves option No. 2, the most likely one House aides told me.
