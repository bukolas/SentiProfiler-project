People all over the blogosphere -- OK, some people -- have been asking about the mayor's leadership in the Google Fiber race. "Where's the mayor?" they ask.

Amanda at Inside Scoop checks in.  Knight said he supports the idea, but has left the issue to council members like Zack Matheny, who can speak about it more proficiently that he can.

I guess that makes sense. OK. so where's Zack? 

I think what people are really wondering is who is the city's voice? Why are the elected officials -- whether they are from City Council, from the county commissioners or are Rep. Howard Coble -- so low-key on this issue, particularly when many other cities are hanging it all out there. Examples: renaming highways after Google; renaming cities after Google; urging firstborns to be renamed Google Fiber; and swimming with sharks for Google. 

It is OK to have fun, isn't it?  

We brought home a passel of awards last night from the AP and the N.C. Press Association. Several items worth noting:

• Betsi Robinson won her second statewide editing award. Since 2003, Betsi and features editor Susan Ladd have won the editing award five times.
• Lorraine Ahearn won three awards in three different categories.
• Jerry Wolford won the photographer of the year award, continuing a darn good year.
• Tim Rickard has won awards in seven of the last 10 contests.

Most significant to me is that five of the awards were efforts by our entire staff.
