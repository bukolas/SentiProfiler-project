So I had another odd dream.....

I enter some unknown town and am waiting in line with my mom.  This kid says to me "what are you doing here?"  Then I look up and my brother also says "aren't you banned from here?"
My mom responds saying "She's invited by me so she has permission to be here"
I turn and see my step dad coming down the escalator and I kiss my mom on her cheek and say "thanks, but I'll be right back"
As my step dad turns to me I go out the door and into my car as the rest of his party begins to chit chat w/him.
For the first time my mom defends me, it's in a dream.  How likely.This is a good story and is true, please read it all the way through until the end!
I am a mother of three (ages 14, 12, 3) and have recently completed my college degree.
The last class I had to take was Sociology.
The teacher was absolutely inspiring with the qualities that I wish every human being had been graced with.
Her last project of the term was called, 'Smile.'
The class was asked to go out and smile at three people and document their reactions.
I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway. So, I thought this would be a piece of cake,
literally.
