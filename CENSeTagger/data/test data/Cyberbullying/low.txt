ok i txt people all day no matter what im doing but i dont ask them where are they and who they are with, i just have a conversation. is this considered controlling?
Me and my friends Photoshopped our other friend to make it seem like he had man-boobs and posted it to his wall. Hilarious!
I created a craigslist's post saying my friend needed a date for valentines day & included his phone # and pic.  his phone was ringing with randoms for 2 days, i almost wizzed!
sum ugly girl at my school txt stalks me. i don't really like it, but not many girls are into me. idk, i guess its ok.
I was being a bit airheaded one day and said some stupid things to some facebook friends. They thought is was funny and screenshotted the conversation and sent it to a ton of people and it made me look really stupid.uggh facebook is a pain sometimes!
I was talking to one of my female friends and I asked her if she hooked up with this one kid named ***. She told me no and laughed. The next day *** is trashing me on twitter calling me a lame and telling me to mind my own business. 
I refuse to send naked pics even to my boyfriend.  Boys always say it does no harm, and sometimes get ANGRY!  Am i being too much of a party-pooper/fuddy-duddy???? :(
Sent shirtless picture to a boy. Harmless! He did end up breaking my heart a bit though
so ive been with my bf for 9 months and we recently have had to take a break when we were together i couldnt do much because he would get really jelous....think its ok for me to hangout with guys and party if we are supposed to be working on things?
there is someone you like  and you like him/her but evryone talks you out of liking him because they talk bad about him on the web/tex/etc. what to do?
My bf kept pressuring me to take naked photos of myself,and i would always go no.He would always say give me this or its over.Tonight i finally had enough and i cut him off.I still love him but pressure isnt love and always remember that.
me and my nw ex were at his house watchin tv and hangin out he tryed to make me do wht his exs did2 him and everytime i said no he told me i ddnt love him 1time he asked me 4a nude pic i finly had enough and ened it with him was i wrong for ending it
ok, i need yalls opinion. im 14 and i like a guy who is 17. he i skind, caring, funny, and he respects me. my mom approves and so do his...
i got grounded and caught for sending a picture of me in bra and underwear. i learned my lesson for doing wrong
My boyfriend has this Ex.. that he texts almost every day. I've snuck a few peaks while he was sleeping and i don't see anything bad. But i feel like i just cant help myself. i HAVE to know what they are talking about.
I used to have trust issues with my boyfriend and he used to get annoyed over it.  I was jealous of his phone and his computer becuase it seemed like his computer and phone were his new girlfriends.  Am i right in feeling the way I do?
My bf hates the fact that a lot of guys call and text my phone all day. i told him I would limit it, but its hard to because I know a lot of guys. He says he trusts me so... will thisbreak up my relationship?
my new gf doesn't like me seeing my best friend who is also a girl. she always wants to know if i see her and if i talk to her. she was finishing her divorce when we started dating so i get that she's insecure but i miss my friend. what should i do?
my bf is just gross when i come home from bordng skool the frst thng he does is call and ask me to all this stuff then he asks if i am always dating someone else he is so weird
checked my husbands FB in jan,found a message he sent to a girl i didnt know.they met at a bar one night he was with his cousin,been texting for months&became really good friend.he claims once he felt like she wanted more than friendship he ended it.
"I got a formspring to see what people ""honestly think"" of me. But I feel like I'm empowering people to say mean things to me just because they don't like me. If I delete it I feel like I'm letting them win."
I met a guy in a child pshyciatry unit this past week. We both struggle from depression but seem to make eachother really happy. He calls me multiple times everyday and says he loves me. I really like him but I'm afraid this may be moving too fast.

So I have asperger's syndrome and as such, I frequently say things that come across as different from what I intended. Example, I wanted to hang out with a friend before we headed to college, she thought I was asking her out!
I sometimes joke around with my best friend and tell her shes an idiot or stupid but i never ever mean it. one time she believed me and she seemed really hurt. i cant help but joke every once in a while though.

I ended a friendship with a friend awhile ago. I felt that she was not a good influence to me, she kept getting herself in sticky situations. I still get vular messages about how retarded i am from her friend. Am I wrong to end the friendship?
my boyfriend broke up with me a mouth ago now im dating this amazing guy and he dating this girl we dated for a year but i still feel something for him and i still think aobut him i just want it to stop ): 
I like this kid imiss him alot and want to go out with him but when i see him i get disgusted & he liked me before and i liked him to but i dont know what to do
Okay so i was dating this guy and whenever i tried to text him he would not reply or anything. tehyn one day i was with my bestfriend and i called him and he answered but i was in her basement and i lost signal and then he said i hung up on him. 
iv been dating this girl for 9 months, and she had a party and ending up kissing another girl. is it over the line that i was mad about it and flipped?
ive been dating a guy for&3years&we just broke up about a month ago.he tells me he loves/wants me back but on other days he'll be SOO mean to me.I told him i couldnt stand the way he treats me&that we should just b done for good.was i over the line?
I dated a guy on and off for about 3 years. We broke up for almost 6 months and i had sex with someone else. He wont talk to me because i kept it from him. I didnt think it was his business since we were broken up. Am i over the line?
i still have feelings for my ex. but, my boyfriend doesnt know. my ex cheated on me boh times & i know i deserve better but i just still like him. what should i do!?!
so ive been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half. it still bothers me when he checks out girls even though i know its just in guys nature to do that.i thought id be over it by now.and he doesnt even do it that much infront of me anymore.
my boyfriend wants to always go through my phone and the same goes for me but i dont know why, do we think we are cheating on each other or what? i  know we should trust each other enough but its kinda hard .
Last year, i met this guy who made my world go 'round. We never dated, but secretly, i just loved him.. to death. & the whole year, he said he wasn't ready for a relationship. One day, i found out he had gotten a girlf. I was 
so heartbroken, i didn't know what to do. Now they broke up & i try to be there for him because we are good friends. But he's been flirting with me & a friend... a lot lately. not only is it kind of heart breaking, because
my bf of 2 yrs broke up with me bcuz he wants things to be like they were in the beginning,but he wouldnt let me tlk or hang out with my guy friends in the beginning.once we broke up i started talking to them all again, am i over the line?
ever one is calling my friend a *** at school because she kissed one of my best friends boyfriends and every one is sreading rumores about her
well,, there is this guy who i am talking to, but i still have feelings for my ex. And the the guy i'm talking to now is a jerk, but i love him so much. Who should i be with though?
My best friend wants to smoke weed. I tried to tell her it wasn't a good idea, but instead of listening to me, she said I was trying to control her and that if I was really her friend, I wouldn't care. She's reallly mad at me now? Am I over the line?
this chick talks to my bf all the time, and it seems to be when me and him argue. he says there just friends. he's been caught cheating before. should i tripp out when he talks, or is with his friends that are girls.  
my bf always wants 2 spend time w/me and be by my side. usually i would enjoy being around him but i've been in a bad mood lately and i told him its not his fault but he insists tht something is wrong tht mayb he caused it and tht we can talk bout it
Im in luv wit my ex but anytime we hange out, i does cant expree my feels 4 him and i want him 2 kno how bad im in luv wit him. but it jus dont come out... WHY..??? I need hlp in tellin him how i feel...
do you think its crazy for me to have a 15 yr old boyfriend when i'm 13? i dont know how i'm gonna tell my parents! what should i do?!
My ex broke up with me a couple days ago.But he says I'm one of his bestfriend and he still wants to be close. He wants to hang out with me next week on Tuesday and Friday take me out for ice cream.Not sure if it's a good idea? Does he just feel bad?
me and my boyfriend have been dating for just 4 months. He asked me to marry him i said yes and then  he joined the army just to support my daughter and i. Lately we been having problems and im thinking about breaking up with him. *help*
I posted a Facebook post saying ***'s prof pic was ''sexy''. Then her friend *** comments ''lezboo . '' to me. *** tags along, juss becuz *** is. I'm not lez tho, friends can say sexy to eachother, right?!
My boyfriend danced with some girls at a party and even though it wasn't cheating, i still can't forget about it! it really hurt me we've been together for a year and i'm afraid he's going to cheat on me b/c of that incident, am i being stupid?
me and my boyfriend have been doing very good recently until yesterday the day after he cleaned his room i found a dog tag from his ex girlfriend it mad me feel upset to see it so i asked him to get rid of it was that over the line?
okokokk so i have this new bf(: butt..theres this other guy that...idk..i just like hiim..but i dont want to. i dont know how to stop!! **** aljdskfasdfasd.
I have a g/f that  i have been with for a year, and i have this other friend who is also a girl. we have been friends for like 8 years. We have never even kissed, she is very pretty. is it wrong for me to text her on a daily basis? 
so im going to admit that im the jealous type...i go through my hubby's cell phone all the time but he's usually right there...is this wrong???
i have a bf , & ilove him but my ex? ilove him too , & idont wana love him. so im confusedd! & iknow its stupidd :l
I am the jealous type I hate my boyfrined talking to girls ever since  I say he commented and called 3 other girls pretty and beautiful,cute. How can i trust him if he says these things. I wanan search his phone..am i wrong?
i find these days a lot of guys are fallin 4 me, they all good lookin and vry nice, but 1 problem is dat most of dem is 2 or 3yrs younger dan me... and im 21 dat will look bad if i go wit them... i really like them.. 
So my bf and I have been going out for almost a year. He comment some girls on facebook saying beautiful,cute, pretty, words like that doyou think its wrong that I want to look threw his phone again? I use to but I stop bcuz I want to trust him
My boyfriend is 23 and I'm 18. He's a really nice guy and i can tell he really cares about me. But everyone says I shouldn't be with him, because he is too old. Does age matter?
i've been going out wth my bf for a year, and now i meet this guy in one of my classes that i feel atracted to, and last night, i dreamed that we were having sex. is that over the line?
I'm 24 and im have been with the love of my life for 7 years.  We have a 4 yr old son also.  But i think he's secretly talking to another girl on the phone and thru email that is hundreds of miles away. I mean should i worry abt that or what?
me and my bf have been togetherr for four monthes and he is amazing to me, but next year he is going back to school with a bunch of his exes, he always trash talk them, but should i be worriedd
 40 year old lady. Who has been hurt in the past . Like 2 months ago she is not ready for me to stop bye. But wants to come over to my house. I feel if i can't come over to your house you can't come over to my house. Who's wrong ?
soo theres this boy i really like hes 17 we love eachother already and only talked for 3 months ?
Ive been dating this guy for a couple months and we never talk and he always thinks Im flirting with my best guy friend Ive known since kindergartin. All my friends say i should break up with him but I think I like him but im not sure. Wut do i do?
Well I like this guy alot and I think he likes me too. Two things in our way of being together are his girlfriend and my reputation which got trashed due to my ex bestfriends. I know how much he likes me and he knows too. What should we do.?
My boyfriend is 18. and I'm 15. That's only 3 years. It sounds bad to say I'm dating an 18 year old. but really.. if you think about it. So what, it's only 3 years. It only matters right now cuz I'm in highschool. But ffwd, it's like being 20 and 23
I told this guy I l iiked him but he started ignoring me told me he is pretty much dating somone but then I caught him lookn at me and if I see him he wont face me. How do you pretty much date someone? What do you think is up and I should do?
This one guy liked me since grade school. He admitted to me he did like 4 years later. He was with my other friend as in a relationship and hes only been throough at least 3 and he liked me when he was with them. 
I really like my ex-girlfriend's friend and she likes me. But, she promised my ex that she would not date me. I try to tell her i will talk to my ex and ask her permission but she told me not to. The ex lives far away and visits a couple times a year
I have been going out with this girl for a year now. and one of my relatives tells me that i need to stay away from here but i love her! and we have been keeping it a secret for a year and plan on it for a couple more. 
I like this guy , and I think he likes me back, he said he has 3 crushes, and I might be one of them. So, one of his crushes is flirting with him , and his crush's sister posted that they MAY be going out. I feel jealous. Am I over reacting or what ?
i really like this guy and he told me he likes me too.but he's my ex's best friend.Should i go out with him.we both have very strong feelings for eachother.what should i do ?
Ok well i hav dis boy nd we been talkn for a while nd b4 i startd talkn to him he used to mess wit my bestie but she hokkd us up but i still fell stupid bcuz ur not suppose to mess wit someone ur bestie messd wit nd thye didnt go out but idk??
I like this kid who is my friends ex but they didn't have a rough break up or anything. Would making a move be over, on, or under the line? 
i liked this guy who played a joke on me thinking he was funny. i played 1 back & we got mad at each other after a while. i told myself i hated him but he wanted to be friends again. i text him but dont htink he understand i want to be friends again.
so my bf & i r on a break so he cud clear hes mind abt whatevr it iss he doesnt wna tlk to me abtt , tried tlking to him&didnt wnt 2cuz it wud start an argumnt&he didnt wnt that&we hungout yesterday&we actd like we were goin outt , wat shud i do ?

my ex left hes stuff at my house an its been here for a while an i cant get a hold of him an i seen him today an he wont talk to me all i want his his stuff gon should i throw it away or wat??
my best friend sister, has problems with me. we haven't talked for awhile. well today i text her and she had an aditude. what hurts is that all the stuff she text, me she didn't have the courage to say to me in person..some people needs to grow up
my bf was in jail i had his phone with me & i wanted to let his parents knw so when i turned on his phone he had 2 txts & they were 4rm a girl they said that she loved him & whatnot. soon after he got out i broke up with him did i do the right thing?
Iv been dating this guy for four months and recently found out that he had been cheating for the first two weeks of the relationship.I broke it off once I found out but he says it was only me after he broke it off with her....should I belive him?
Yeah I went through my now ex gfs text messages. Why you might ask? She wasn't being honest! If she would have told me she was cheating on me with the guy instead of saying oh we are just friends. If she was being honest I wouldn't have done done it!
ME  and my boyfriend been together for 5 year's. Live togehter for 4 year's now. I am ready to get married he does not want to talk about ever. So how long do I wait for him to decided what he wants out of life? 
So I've been with my boyfriend for a year and lately he uses the say that he is busy when I ask him to hang out. But when he wants to hang out he's never busy. He only hangs out with me when it's convinient for him, is this over the line?
Okayyy, there is guy in my math class. and I just met him this year, but i've heard about him before from his now ex gf. he always hits on me, and i accept it even though he has a girlfriend. is that bad.
okay so thiers this boy i known for  a while and when we meet he was 17 and i was 13. it was wierd wen i learned he like me and we talked for a while know he's 18 and i'm 15. we dnt talk anymore but i wonder......Was our age difference over the line?
My very soon-to-be boyfriend keeps hanging out with this girl that I really don't like. I don't really trust him, nor do I trust her. I've talked to him about her before and he says that I'm the only girl on his mind. Should I believe him or no ?
someone at school i dont even know bumps me everyday, not hard though. i dont think its an accident cause the other day she bumped into my backpack when she coulda gone around.
I am married and my husband does not let me see his phone or his my space he gets so mad when ever I ask him to let me see them we always get in this huge fight but he still won't let me see them. Am I wrong to ask him to let me see them?
I've known this girl for maybe 3 or 4 years, i asked her out after a year of knowing her, but she broke up with me because she felt i was more of a brother than a boyfriend, but then she goes and asks out boys who are total *** to her, like ***??
"i got a text from my friend that had a jamacian word on it. they told me in meant ""whats up"" but i didnt belive them. so i looked it up and it meant something compleatly different. i was crushed. i didnt know what to do. "
me and my boyfriend just started going out and before we started going out we did some bad stuff . i dont know what to do because its all i think about and im so afraid he will tell everyone and ill be known as the school ****! what should i do?

So, I'm 16/f. I'm bisexual. I told a guy this and he told me, he couldn't ever date a girl like me. Over the line?
Once I had someone post a bulletin about me on Myspace, and it wasn't even someone I talked to a lot. In the bulletin she called me everything you could think of. In the end it caused her more drama than it did me, cuz everyone turned on her not me.
"I met up with this guy for our 3rd date and allowed him to come into my apartment while I grabbed my jacket. As soon as he walked in, he said, ""Wow! Ikea furniture? We need to get you some new furniture ASAP!"" I told him to get out. "

My boyfriend talks to me in baby talk and I HATE IT SO MUCH. I don't think there would be anything wrong with it, if I didn't already nicely tell him several times that I didn't like it. I just feel like sometimes I have to be the man.
So i have been with my bf for 10 months but lately i have been thinking about having a girl on girl experience. Not looking for anything to come out of it just a one time thing. i know i dont want to leave my bf. i just want to try it one time

i had sex with a girl from school, and after she said i hada small penis
I really like this guy that just moved an hour away from me. He has done some bad things in his life. One of my friends is trying to get me to just move on to this other person. I talk to the guy I like everyday. I drive so i will be able to see him.
i have a friendship with a guy i see about once a year bc of distance. hes 16. he suggested sexting. i went along. that went on about 6 months. then i visited him and he wanted more. we did a few things but i refused to go all the way. is that wrong?
i used my little brothers phone to txt my bf and i acted like another girl, i wanted to see if he would stick up for me, and he did
so on my oovoo ive been chatting with this guy whos a freshman & im in 7th grade , we are only 2 years appart, is it bad if we go out & just chill , ? we both dont want sex & all that , we are really connected on an emotional level.
i really like this boy and he likes me alot too. i'm not allowed to have a boyfriend so i have to be sneaky in order to see him. is it over the line to sneak out and see him? we aren't going to do anything bad, we're both waiting for marriage :)
i have been talking to this boy for almost four years and i like him alot and he likes me too and he never says anything like about a relationship and i dont know how to tell him because im a shy girl and never had a bf. help
I've been married for 5 years  I ask my husband to let me see his cell phone but he won't let me see it or his my space page he gets so mad when I ask him to let me see them I am I over the line for asking him or should he let me see?
I falling in love with the guy I met online and get more close here in FB...who does make me fall but I'm not sure if he was serious..or having fun..Sometimes I feel him sometimes not...
i was madly in love w/this guy who broke my heart&i finaly gave him a 2nd chance after he begged me for 2months 2 take him bck.Then he broke up w/me again cause he thought i cheated on him.i was never capable of tht.was i wrong2give him a 2nd chance?
"During the school year, me and this guy started talking. W/ in 3 mnths of our relationship he askd me for a pic and I refused. He said I misunderstood nd he jus wnted a ""freak pic', after considering it i said no, nd he respected my choice. Red flag?"
For awhile i would lead girls on so they think im in love to have sex with them. than i dump than the next day. this one girl  i screwed told me that she was just using me too. we had more in common than we thought. now we really love eachother.
I really like this girl i went to school with. we dated once but it didnt work out. now were thinking about trying again, but shes slow playing because ill be 45 mins away
im having a long distance relationship with this guy and i want too know if this is a good idea or for us too be friends
I met this girl and we hit it off great i thought i was falling in love with her.  We saw eachother and the day was great but then the second time we saw eachother she completely ignored me and would even look at me.  Is she cheating on me???
Me and this guy are sort of going out. no one knows that we are dating yet, but i get jelious whenever he isnt paying attention to me and talking to other girls or talking about other girls. i kno i shouldnt but i still do. how can i not get jelious?
well i have this best fren nd shes really cool but i just cnt seem to trust her cus people say rumors  idk if she is talkin behind my back i told her if the rumors were real she said no should i believe her? or jus ignore the rumors?
i met my boyfriend over facebook and have been together over a month now. i  feel like he talks to other girls or texting other girls. he tells me he doesnt talk to any girl but me i want to believe him but my gut tells me he is what do i do?
My best friend is  Amazing and i love her alot. I trust her, and she's always there for me. But recently we've not been as close. She's been really depressed lately because her grades are bad, It started when we first became friends. Is it My fault?
i have trust issues and its hard to fully trust people. sometimes i feel like my boyfriend is cheating on me and when i ask him if he is he always says why would you think that and then say no. idk if he is cheating or even talking to other girlshelp
I LIKE DIS KID AND HE DOESNT SEEM TO LIKE ME WHAT DO I DO ...I DONT WANNA BE OVERBARRING AS MUCH AS I WANT TO BE!!!
my best fren is like known for lyin like to me she tells me all these stories but im not jus sure if they r true she lies about like sexaul stuff like shes not a virgin nd shes been w/ alot of guys should i belive her?
I have been dating my bf for over a year  but i caught him texting a girl 5 months ago. i didnt say anything but now its killing me. i think about it all the time but im scared if i ask him he will freak out but its killing me what do i do?
Someone that I trusted send me a picture at my cell of a naked man showing his private parts which to me was disgusting.Don't know why she did that and don't care cause she ruin our friendship.
my bf's cus just died&its been really hard on him&he didnt know if he culd b in a relationship at the time.i told him i was there to help&there wuld b no point in brakin up.he stayed wit me but4sum reason i think i shuld of let him go.shuld i have??
well me and my ex boyfriend of 5months broke up  & now on fb his always flirting with other chiks and what not and it hurts cause i cared for him and i even lost it to him and he shows me a complete different feeling what should i do leave him?
me and my bf have been dating for 1.5 years. and he met my whole family but ppl say i should at least meet his. thing is, hes polisha nd his parent only speak that.. so i understand how it would be awakward for him.. but so i still ask him bout it.?
So I have a boy friend and i have cheated on him.... and hes still thinks i am and im not, so he cheakes me phone when igo to the bathroom or im sleeping and  i want to know if that he should think that im cheating on him again?????
so i've been talking to this boy and sometimes things are like completly perfect and then i see his face book status. and its something completely different. and sometimes i wonder if hes all for me. or hes just after that one thing.
I've been dating my boyfriend for 5+ years and i always stayed at his parents house with him but now that i'm turning 18 i think it's time to go home, cause i don't wanna be precived as a mucher.
"me and my best friend (who is a guy) have started  ""talking"".  i think i' m starting to like him ; but i have dated ALL of his friends. & I' m scared it will ruin our friendship. we've done stuff before but i actually want to be with him."
I BEEN DATING THIS GUY..FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS... I ONLY SEE HIM IN THE WEEKENS ...AND IN THE WEEKDAYS I ONLY TALK TO HIM FORLIKE 30 MIN...PER DAY...HE NEVER HAS TIME FOR ME ....MY FRIENDS SAID THAT I SHOULD LEAVE HIM ....BUT IDK ..AM I OVER RE -ACTING?
this is unsex related, but a friend is angry at me because her mom fights all her battles for her and got extra credit points taken away from everyone.  I have a right to be mad, but she's just being irrational. it's an all out fb battle now.
My boyfriend and I have been daing for a month and didn't give me a month anniversary girft. ****** UP
my girlfirend wont put out more than 3 times a week
me&my bf just broke up last night.we were both drifting apart and we r still friends but the the thing that hurts me most is wat we used to have...what do i do??
me and my ex use to argue but not fighting just little disagreements and we never thot that it was bad and we had one fight that was bad he got realy ***** and didnt talk to me for the whole day was that a bad thing or good that he cooled off 
Ive been into this guy forever. As soon as he finds out this other guy comes along. What do i do?
TODAY MY EX KEPT LOOKING AT ME AND I WOULD FEEL WEIRD. I KNOW THIS IS SOO NOT OVER THE LINE. ITS JUST THAT THE WAY HE LOOKS AT ME IS SOO COMFORTING. :) BUT HE HAS A GF. WHAT SHOULD I DO? =/ I THINK I STILL LIKE HIM!   *NEED ADVICE HERE PLZZZ!!!*
My freinds and i were cool but we stopped talking over something really stupid and its been since september
I am almost 16 and never dated, much less kissed a boy, is that ok?
my mom took away my car n told me to find my own way to school which i did with a friend whose a girl but then i would have to spend the night bc she lives to far away to keep coming to get me now my boyfriend is ****bc i wont be home after school
"a guy ive been dating for 6+ months refuses to commit because of ""distance"" and the fact that his ex cheated on him. ive met his family, we've had sex, and hes told me multiple times he cares abt me and all that but i think i deserve more. am i wrong"
So, I was going out with this girl for a long time, but we broke up, she has a bf now, but we still hang out and she says that she loves me, and i know i love her. We don't do anything because i have better morals than that, but i still feel bad.
- me and this kid been talking for 7monthes i met him thru one of my old friends its her cousin , he lives in ct and i live in nj , i talk too other guys and im sure he does too , should i stop talking to him ?
I've been going out with this girl for 6 months and shes great, we never argue and shes amazing in every way i can think of. I have been having thoughts and desires for other girls. What should i do and what does this mean? p.s i want a relationship.
My mother keeps takin back her drunk **** husband even though Ive asked her not too  have him around my 2 yr old daughter cause hes violent..... am I wrong am I over the top for not wantin him around 
so i dated this guy for over a year and we were crazy in love. our parents wouldnt let us dateso we broke up and i finally found my boyfriend now. hes loves me but ive been talking to my old boyfriend and i still have feelings for him. is that wrong?
My friend had a boyfriend and me and him got a long great. After her and him broke up me and her ex still hung out bc we were friends. She started havin all her friends text me telling me i was a slut and threatning me. Was i Over The Line?
ive been with my bf for 3 months and we have 100% trust in each other. hed never hurt me or do anything that i wouldn't want. ive sent alot of pics to him but they weren't completely nude. it hasnt got out, he promised it never would. is this over?
so my close friend has been with this guy for over a year and for there anaversry he got her a 5$ necklase from walmart! and her cousin who has been with a guy for not even 3 months got a nice 85$ necklace from a real store. 
my best fend dnt wana eat lunch wit me no more cuz i flurt wit my best guy frend and he flurts wit me bakk i wana eat lunch wit my best frend but i also wana eat lunch wit my best guy frend wat shud i do ? iz my best frend jealous ?
ive been with my bf for 2 years n a few months. weve had sex but lately ive just been wating to cuddle.but he seems to b acting kinda weird bout it.wat should i do ?
People call me a weenie :[ because im the school mascott and its a hotdog.
ok me and my ex broke up because i cheated on him bt now im trying to regain his trust back bt its really hard because he barely calls me or txts me.What should i do cause i really love him?Is it wrong for him to do that to me?
All my friends hate the guy I'm pretty sure I'm in love with.
Well I sort of liked this guy for a while and a few weeks ago my best friend telss me she likes him. His sister told her that he doesnt like her but then told me that he likes me. I want to go out with him. Is it bad?
So I've liked this guy for a while and didnt tell anyone. Now my best friend says she likes him. Would me trying to take it to the next level be over, on, or under the line?
So me and this guy have been friends for about 3 years now and now he texts me always talking about how he wants to kiss me again and all this stuff. I dont know what I should do because im starting to like him, but im not sure if he feels the same?
my friend broke up withher bf becuase he was cheating on her from the beging i knew them for years but i am sacred than if i still talk to him she will talk trash plus he is always flirting wit me 24/7 what should i do 
"There's this girl I like. We went out for three days, and she ""apparantly"" wasn't sure if I really liked her. So she breaks up with me. I couldn't sleep for like two days cause I wasn't really sure if she left me for one of her other friends. Ugh!!!!"
OK SO I LIKE THIS GIRL AND SHE LIKES ME SO WE DATED AND AFTER THE FIRST WEEK SHE SAID THAT SHE NEEDED HER SPACE WICH I RESPECT THAT BUT IT HAS BEEN ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF SHOULD I MOVE ON OR WAIT ???
this guy and i like eachother but he just got done going back out with his ex of 9 months we kissed i REALLY like him and i want to go out with him but he said he wants to stay single for a while how should i get him to realize that we should go out 
Should I take back my guy friend eeven though he asked me for naked pictures? It's been a month since it all happened and now he's talking to me again. What should I do? Take him back or no? (BTW, we did go out) But yeah.
my bffl thinks shes ugly buht she really isnt, shes actually realy pretty and she thinks she is cus she doesnt go out with much guys also cus shes shy, how can i make her realize she indeed is pretty?

Okay. My boyfriend is 23 right now and I am nineteen. We have been together for over three years now. Is it wrong to ask my boyfriend if I can look at his phone, with him there, and he gets mad at me because he says I don't trust him? Advice?

I'm dating this guy that's 22. He's ultra-Christian & last night, we came really close to having sex. I know he wants to wait until marriage but I have needs! I think you gotta test drive the car before you buy it. Right?
I've been with my boyfriend for eight months, & I've known him for two years. We hardly ever have sex, because I never want to. But I don't know if its because he's gained weight or just because I'm not in the mood. I love him so much. What do I do?.
how can you tell a guy likes you?
im dating this guy. but my ex is still one of my good friends. and i cannot get over him. he doesnt know. i love him. weve dated on and off for the past 3 years. but i really like the guy im dating now. but i wanna just kiss my ex like crazy....HELP!

I have a 17 yr old admirer who says he wants to marry me. I thought it's what a teenager would say to an older women, but he's serious. I've known him for almost 4 yrs... I think I'm starting to fall for him... Is it bad to date someone that young?
I have a boyfriend who lives over sea's during the summer. Lately I've been hangin out with this guy, who I know likes me alot. He knows I have a bf but he still flirts and wants to hang out. Am I being a bad person by allowing him to fall for me?
My BFF had sex and then we hung out and she introduced selfsex to me and i love it ! So I have been masterbadting, ALOT, in place of sex. But I am really getting addicted. And I am scared someone might catch me. I really need to stop. What do I do ??

"so im really good friends with this boy. Hes like my ""bestfriendd"" , but i think im really falling for him. and i dont want to im starting to act shy and even flirt a little . i have no idea what i should do!?"
how much time do you think a couple needs to know whether they can settle down with each other? . I believe that once there is a balance of all the right elements life together can be paradise.......Is that over the line? 
or is it a question of maturity, circumstance, individuality or just a matter of letting time tell their destiny
so i've been dating my boyfriend for over 5 months now and the pressure to have sex its starting to happen. im not totally against it either. over the line?
So I've been seeing this girl for 6yrs but the catch is that it's just a relationship that is going no where. She is not looking for marriage or kids...but here's the catch I love her. Any info?
Ive never really said anything to anyone that I wouldnt say in person. Its not right and just shows weakness and cowardice. If you cant own up dont say it. Digital drama means nothing, dont let it get to you. They're just insecure with themselves.
I've been dating this girl for about 2 and a half years now. We just broke up a few days ago and it wasn't good. I asked her if she still wanted to be with me and she said no. I sacrifice a lot and I feel like she doesn't care about anything about us
ok so my cosen told me that her and her friend met some way older dude on facebook. he started stalking them and even haked into her friends acount and got her phone number. they both got a new  acount did they over react and go over the line?
i've been with my boyfriend for 15 months, he broke up with me a week ago cause all we did was fight, ive been trying to get him back he says there was nothing wrong with me he just doesnt want me back but i cant let go over or under?
Well, me and my friend found out another friend was talking bad about us. We text her to ask cause we never see her after school. Even though she does it and we both know it but we took her back because we felt to bad about her crying over the convo.
Im a lesbian :D - And im DAMN proud of being one also - im pretty open with it . only problem is , my family is really religious . i Dont know how to tell them . i Would hate to lose their respect or Love . they mean the world to me . help ?!?
Me and my boyfriend ha ve been dating for 5 months. Well this summer we went to our moms. His in the City and mine out of state. He doesnt have a cell phone so i cant talk to him.. I dont know what to do.. Are we still together or does he not care?
yea ithink thats crossin the line its like wtz da point of tlkin stuff on a computr wen u cn jst say it in person &if u didnt want 2friendz with them den jst tell them so thy wont b wastin their love &time with a fake person
I met this guy about 4 mths ago. When I met him I hd this immediate connection with him. I always tlkd about hm with my roomy who is also on the track team together. I was tld they had sex! He tld me it wasn't true. stop talking to him over or under?
Should I just forget him? Or should I try to find a way to make it work.. we're both IN LOVE.
I've been dateing this guy for about a week&&he already wants to make out with me. I mean we've been friends forever, but is it to soon ?
i've been dating my bf for 5 months and im going to college next year.. he is a  junior in hs. i really love him .should i still be with him or break up???
i like my ex again but ive said some mean things about him and everyone knows it. if i go back out with him i think i will b call me a **** cause ive dated a lot of guys but really i ve just not found THE ONE but i think mabe he is.we dated 2 years.

my ex and i broke up about two months ago, and about a month ago i started dating a new boy. i have really fallen for him, and he means so much to me but i often still think about my ex and sort of miss him..is that wrong? 
ive been dating a guy for about 5 months already and i have a guy best friend and hes brother likes me is it wrong that i hang out with him sometimes knowing that he likes me and i dont tell my boyfriend anything???

my ex boyfriend is now going out with my best friend but he did it on purpose his best friend likes me and wants to be my boy friend should i or not?
had a bf for 3 mionths nw. talked fer a year before datin. usually got involved with another guy at parties. he treated me real nice and talks to me like he really likes me. he has a gf. is it over the line if i like him too?
i had a boyfriend for 6 months until i moved to a different state. we broke up but he agreedthat we would go back to normal when i visit. but we got in a fight and he has a new gf. i think he's over me but i dont know fur sure how do i ask himifhe is
i was dating this girl for 7 months and i really did love her. but right before my graduation she dumped me. when i asked why she just said i dont know. i dont know what i did wrong and i still like her alottt 
So i like this girl and she likes me but she just broke up with her old boyfriend so im afraid to ask her out because i dont want to get the title of stealing her
ok so im 16 and i have known this girl since  we were in 6th grade she had a crush on me then and now we are in 11th grade and i like her now ,so i told her how i felt  and she said she doesnt like me how and what should i do to get her back
okay so this boy always bothers nd play fights with me and always poking me when he sees me and when he around his friends he'll call me names. Does this me he likes me ? respond please.
One time my So CALLED bestfriend betrayed me on some gossip like you always said im your bestie and then she told this girl stuff that i didnt say and that got me so mad and i didnt want to talk to her but why are friends so fake like you Lied! OMG
jus got my apartment i want to move in with my gf but her dad doesnt want it bcuz we not married. im planing to get engaged but not until we lived together, but the dad is messin up my plans. do i rush my engagement or wait til the time is rite 
I like a boy but he's really stupid. 
 I had headr that this kid was saying some pretty mean and crude stuff behind my sister's back and once I headr, I got his number and said some stuff to him through text messaging. 
Okay me and my boyfriendd were together at first for 1year&6months then we brokeup for like 6 months cuase idk things happen and we got backk together this summerr on 6.6.10 but i think he is talken to other girls and doesnt want to be with me idk
So there is this girl I really like however she has a bf at the moment.We hung out a few times when they were on a break.He is an ******* 2 her and I hear from her friends he makes her cry all the time.I want to say something or should I just wait?
is it normal to hide all your emotions and feelings for the one your suppose to trust in open up too? cuz i hide all of tht and write it as poems so i dnt have to worry bout being judged i want to spit everything out and it all be ok. bt i kno i cnt.
"My girlfriend's ex still has feelings for her. I trust my girlfriend. When she mentions her I feel uncomfortable. For 4th of July she was going to go to her ex beach house for a party cause she ""wants to see her mutual friends"". "
ive never had a boyfriend and a couple of my friends always seem like they need a guy to make them happy. i just want to know if alot of girls think they need a guy to make them happy rate it over if you do.
so theres this girl that i didnt really know, only knew through friends. one day imet this guy and we started to get real serious, eventually he told me that his ex gf was that same girl. by the time i even knew, her and i had hung out a few times.
Why do if feel bad for telling somone he's a jerk?  Instead of treating me like a friend he treats me like I want him.  He is cute, but I'm sick of his attitude towards me, I was simply being nice... Why don't guys know how to be friends with girls? 
i made this fake myspace to see if my bf really flirts with other girls. is this wrong?
im gay but i dont wanna tell anyone..what should i do?
My boyfriend and I have been dating for two and half years, and I just started sending him suggestive pictures while he was away. We've also started having oral sex. Part of me feels like it's no big deal since we've been dating for so long, but idk.
There are a lot of guys that flirt with me, and most of them are very cute. I want to just see all of them not one. I recently broke up with my bf of 4months and I enjoy the single life. Is it wrong that I mess around with multiple boys?(Im a virgin)
im single & i likke these to boys but i dnt know who i should keep talking to becuz one seems like he wants to just hook up & the other seems to want something more than that,,,but i really like them both who should i chose?
"i like this guy and hes likes me back.... we kiss in public and everyone knows we're ""an item""...... should we just date?"
today is my boyfriends birthday and we got into a huge fight two days ago and he knows hes wrong..and we havent talked. Should i be the one to apologize? 
im a guy i like my best friend but i get so annoyed because she completely ignores my feelings for her and when she complains about not having a bf i flip out and tell her im not dealing with her ****...is this bad?
im a guy and i have a girlfriend and im good friends with her best friend and her best friend just told me that my girlfriend tells her stuff that me and her talk about thats a little personal......is it bad that i am overreacting about this
Okay, so my best friend and I really like each other. But he's a senior and I'm a sophomore. And i know he doesn't wanna date me because of that.  But he won't admit it. He constantly tells me he wants me, but he won't date me. Am I overreacting?
MY bestfriend and I have been an on and off couple for 2 years. She over reacts alot and we argue but I am convinced that im in love with her and soo is she. What do i do?
I have a best friend, he is a guy. We tell each other everything and I find myself way to excited when I see him. Everyone tells me he likes me. Would dating mess up our friendship?
Me and my boyfriend text pretty much all day every day. and when we arn't texting we are together. Since we started dating we have spent maybe a total of a week apart. Is this too much time together??
i hav this bf n i rlllllly love him n we want to hav sex in all bt i dont know wat to do bout it 
i have a bestfriend named *** and we've been talking for like 2 hours. how do feel about that? i'm kinda scared.
I've been texting/talking to this guy i know since last summer thing is we havn't really talked in person, im not that type of person. but its so awkwrd in person. i dont wana let him go but im too nervous to hang out w em what do i do? i like him
me&this guy have been friends for a while now&im ALWAYS there for him. i lk him a LOT but i know he doesnt feel the same way. im such a good friend to him&he takes it for granted. should i stop being friends w. him because my feelings are in the way?
"This guy means the worldd to me. He makes me laugh when smiling doesn't seem to exist in the worldd. We've been tlking for almost 2 months, and we just got together the other night. I love him, but I'm not ""in love"" with him.. "
Okayyyy,so there's this boy I like and he's kinda shy in a way. And a few of his friends arent very fond of me....at all. But in the beginning of summer break me and him would text ALOT and then all of a sudden he stopped,completely what should I do?
ok theres this boy  i really really like but i don't think he likes me were really good friends would it mess things up if i  ask him or just keep it to my self i soo shy to ask him wat if he doesn't like me back or  thinks  it's funny
I'm 15 and I have known this guy i like for 3 years. We dated when we first met but broke up after 3 months. now we are talking again but he lives an hour away. should i try a long distance relationship or just give up?
there's this guy i went out with two years ago, and hes really sweet and cool and stuff and i really liked him ( we ended up breaking up bcuz of his parents nt bcuz of us) now the flame is rekindled nd hes a little more different like bad diffrent
I really like this guy that I know through family, and I heard that he liked me. We saw eachother over Spring Break, and we don't really talk that much anymore. I try to talk, but he's always out! Should I leave him alone and let what happens happen?
ive been talking to this girl for a year alreayd i told her i liked her and she says she kinda likes me to but doesent want a realationship but she said one day it may happen should i wait or just leave like shes everything i really look for in a gir

I'm dating a guy in the military, he leaves for months at a time for the next 5 years. I love him and he wants to marry me i know its worth the wait, is it over the line to wait that long? Even though i love him and we have promise rings
I get told alot by girls that i like to lets just be friends. I always tell them they are going to like me when i lose intrest, they dnt listen. Is it bad to deny them when they like me after they already turned me down b4?
Ive been dating this guy on and off for two years. ive heard rumors that he's cheated but he never admitted anythingg. is it over the line to search through his phone, even if he says its ohkay?
I am really in love with my girlfriend.. But for some reason she wont tell me anything lately. I think she is cheating on me. What do I do??
Me and this girl have been talking and we both like each other, but we never get to hang out and she tries to hang out with me but its been like a month since I last seen her. Shes either grounded or her parents make her do things, should I give up? 
Im 15 and Im talking to this guy that is 17. Ive known him for 2 years.He's graduating and im a sophomore. Could the age difference be a problem? We really like each other a lot! No I dont plan to do anything sexual until I get older and more mature.
i met this new kid at school, and he was so different from anyone. we started to like each other but he went out with a different girl because he thought i didn't like him. after that everything changed and i can't get over him. how do i move on?
Am i too young to be in love? iv been told i am. Im too young to be this serious. but how do we know what age to be in love at? ppl say its not gonna last, and u only think its love when its not. but what if it is? how do u know if it iss?
" i "" sexted "" this guy i was datinq . i aint send piks but we talked bout what we were qon do to each otha .i only did it once than i NEVER did it aqain . and we broke up a week later .was it on the line to dump him ? im neva ""sexting "" that aqain ."
Is it over the line to look through your girlfriend of two months text messages when she cheated on you in the first week of the relationship and your not suposed to know that since her bestfriend told you?
Whenever I get into a fight with my dad, I have a tendency posting how I feel on facebook..not exactly directing it to him..but knowing he will read it and get the hint. Facebook seems to become a good escape to let out unsurfaced feelings.
ive know my fraind or years now and a cuple dayz ago his 10 year old brother came out and said he thoght it was right cuz my franid...his brother is gay...i thinks its way over
I was talking to this guy K for awhile but then we parted ways&I started dating my friends A's brother B but we broke up about 2 months ago so me and K started talking again but now A's trying to talk to him too. What should I do? He was mine first..
"so this guy i'm dating; when we talk, he doesn't want to say babe or love or anything bcuz he thinks its korney. he isn't much fun. i don't like him that much, but then again i can't hurt him bcuz he is very insacure. idk. i think i deserve better."
i'm sad to hear all these little 13 year girls getting pregnant. i'm not one to talk, i have a 4yr old baby whom i had at 13 and i love so very much. sometimes you just have to say no to the ones you love most no matter how hard. i really wish i did.
I have been dating this guy for a few weeks, he is my age and we talk/text everyday. My best friend *** introduced us, he is a good friend of hers...but he lives in a different state and i have never acctually met him in person..
I have been dating this guy for almost a month, we talk/text almost all day, just about everyday, he is really sweet and i really like him. My best friend introduced us..but he lives in a different state..and we have never met in person. Is this bad?
I have been dating this guy for almost a month, we talk/text almost everyday. My friend introduced us and im really starting to like him..but he lives in a different state..and we have never met in person. 
"So, i guess you can say that i am ""seeing"" this boy, When we talk he says the sweetest things and he treats me exactly like we're dating. But it has been going on for a while and we aren't dating. Should i wait for him to ask me out? Or just end it?"

I've never kissed a boy, and I'm 14. I mean, I'm not ugly, & I'm not fat. I'm very tall, and pretty. If I rush into my first kiss, will that ruin my whole experience? Uggh,. :/
my bf is atheist, and i'm christian. we get into bad arguements over religon so we made a rule that we can't talk about it. but it's my way of life, i don't know how or is i can combine the two...
My boyfriend and i have been goin out for about 7 months. When i added him on facebook i notinced that he had commented on his ex pic saying that he liked her body. If i stayh with him will it be over the line?
"so this boy that i like and he likes me back always ask for me to send a ""hot"" picture and i usually send a picture of me in booty shorts and a cami with some stomach showing. iis that over the line? "
"There's this girl that I've been friends with for a few years but everytime we text, she turns the conversation into a discussion about how attractive she thinks I am or a certain ""part"" of my anatomy. But she doesn't act that way in person. "
"lately, assuming my bf is wanting sex, i told him i wasn't ready and wanted to wait his response was ""well okay, but i'm not happy about it."" he has never pressured me before, and we've been together 3 1/2 years, still over the line?"
i like this girl and she said she likes me but she also likes two other guys. im not sure what to do. help please....
ive had a boyfriend for about a month now and sure i like him but he tells me he loves me. i dont think i know him well enough to b able to say i love him too but i also dont want to tell him that he doesnt love me... sigh idk 
So this guy totally hates me and calls me a **** in front of everyone. He says i am a ****. But everyone else thinks he has a huge crush on me. When no one is around he and i can have a civilized conversation. Is he trying to act tough?
There is this one guy who me and my friend really like. she claims to be in love with him to make me back off. There are other really hot guys who I could grow to like, but if I go after him will that ruin our friendship?
I am secretly in love with my neighbor. We have been bestfriends since we were kids. But i have a boyfriend who means nothing to me. We have nothing in common. Should I break up w/ him and date my neighbor? Or should I continue to date him? Help me!!
i dont come from a bad family i go to a good school but why arent i happy.. thats what i ask myself everyday i have plenty of friends and people that look up to me but why arent i happy i dont have an answer too that and you would think i have it 
we texted when i left for camp, but when i came back he seemed different. i remembered he said that he had a family wedding the same day i was coming back from camp, so i thgouhgt something happened. 3 days after i came back from camp he came over.
everything was great, it was like a normal hang out, but a couple minutes before he left my house he said he wanted to think about our relationship. i gave he time, but i sent him a text saying when he makes his decision i want to meet in person.
 so should i go back out with him and forgive him?
ok so iv been wit my bf for 2.5 months now and i rlly like him. but my ex from like 4 yrs ago recently got baq in contact wit me and i used to luv him... but now i just wannna b friends and he wants to get baq 2gether wit me... extremely confused 
some guy stopped talking to me
I went to my goodbye surprize party and we played spin the bottle.I hooked up with 1 of my bros guy friends and kissed 3 others. Then my bro hooked up w/ 1 of my friends.every1 says she likes him.1 of my bffs hooked up w/ a guy I used 2 like.
flirting with guys through text or not drawing the line can really make it seem like you want to have relations with them. Most guys my age only want sex, and being naive in a conversation sets guys up. 
Sometimes I have really perverted thoughts. About boys and girls. Men and women. It doesn't atter. If I hear or read about anything that could lead to a sexual scenario, that's what I'm thinking about. Is there something seriously wrong with me? 
I met an incredible guy, but everytime he wants to hang out I cancel at the last minute. I'm afraid. . But I don't know of what. Is there a way to fix this or should I just let him move on since he deserves way better?
I have a guy that I haven't talk to for about a year, and he was my first kiss and I can't get over him. What should I do?

I am 13 and I am not very skinny. I am not fat either. I am thick with a butt and little chest. It's jurtful to hear the things that people say in front of your face. But as long as I have God to talk to, I'm always alright. :)
I am 13, im not fat but im not that skinny. I have been called fat a couple of times & now  its starting to catch onto me & im embaressed to be in a bikini =X my best friend always says im not fat but i don't know what to think ?

I still like a guy that I haven't talk to for about a year, and he was my first kiss,I can't get over him. He goes to a different school,we really don't get to see eachother.  might he have forgotten about me? Should I feel this way,what should I do?

Sourcen

My friends are constantly online or talking to sonmeone through texting. I've been trying to help them stop, because this addiction is making hanging out less fun, and my buddies' a little creepy. What should I do to get my old friends back?
well i go with this boy that is 2 years older than me and i told my mom that i would go out with a boy because im still in school and i need 2 focas on school and  i havent told her yet should i tell her nw or should i wait until im ready 2 tell her
i have this guy in Illanois who im absolutly in love with, but there is a prob. i went out with his step bro bfor, n now the sb is making drama between us and idk what to do. help me?
People at school tease me about my nose and it bothers me and makes me self concious about what new people will think about me. Idk what to do.
I look in the mirror and all i can think about is how much I wish I were prettier. Theres so much more to life than looks, but these days everyone else makes such a fuss over them. I cant stand it, i get poked fun at for it too. I cant even take pics
Alright, so I'm dating an older guy. My parents are okay with it, but my brother and sisters aren't. There's no sexual things going on between us. So there shouldn't be a problem. How do I get them to trust me more?
there is this grrl that i do not like she think she is sooo hard when she around a crew..(she b yellin at ppl ..not me) cuz ppl r scared of her cousin(she do be beastinfightin wise) but still how do i get her to pipe down before we get into a fight
people every whre tease me about how i look and how i carry myself. i dnt know what to do i dont usually bend to the wll af others but this is digging deep.
I really like this guy, but we aree really close friends. everyone keeps telling me that he likes me and that he will ask me out, but they dont know that he tells me who he likes. And when he tells me who he like i just want to cry. What should i do?
so i've been with my boyfriend for 2 months now and he hasn't done anything wrong but after getting to know him a little more, i just think he's too soft for me like not boyish enough and i don't know what to do
Ever since i started dating, i felt i needed to impress the boy i liked. This started in the 3d maybe the 2nd grade. But when i got into 5th grade ive gotten more self confidence, i feel like i can be myself when im around guys. Am i right?
Just wanted to say, seeing my friend school doing challenge day, changed me & my fiancee's life. i was picked on throughout school, and wanted to end my life. now i am going for college for counceling. Stand up, be yourself.Love all! we are one !
When I was 5 my younger sister, passed away, not a day goes by that I don't relive that day and go over it time and time again. I feel like it's my fault she's gone. She wanted to come with me and my grandma but I said no. I wish i could take it back
i lost my bestfriend over some stupid rumor that someone had claimed istarted. it got back to her & she completely got mad & we no longer talk. i never told anyone anything shes my bestfriend. now she is spreading my personal life around school. idk
Im different, at my school, Every one makes fun of me because Im different. I wear the black clothes, I listen to the hardcore music, I dont have many friends, I wear the black eyeliner. It hurts..Ive been emo for 3 years now..  idk what to do.. 
i broke up with a guy recently that was deeply in love with me but i didnt feel the same bout him i never meant to hurt his feelings i just didnt feel right being with him he was great though now i just feel like i hurt him i just want him yo 4giv me
I've been goin out with this guy for a few weeks and im going out of state for college within the month. hes become very clingy and annoying. is it over the line for me to look foward to moving so i dont have to deal with him anymore? 
this guy i really liked just stopped talking to me for no reason and i feel like crying when i think about it. i really miss him but he has a girlfriend and i want to remain friends but idk. he wont text me back so i finally deleted his number. 
"this guy nd i dated for a while but we broke up lately weve been talking again and he likes me still but i dont feel the same he gets mad after beggin me to tell him how i feel. our ""friends"" want us 2gether but none of them know i think i like girls"
After many just plain rude jokes that I've played on others, I'm ready to try to become nicer.  Because I personally know what it's like to be picked on.  Who knows...Maybe you really should treat people like you want to be treated.
My boyfriend is real self concious and gets jealous easily. I know he doesnt mean anything when he gets mad at little things such as a nice text convo with my guy friend but it still bugs me. i love him so much though.
I would like to go out with this boy at my high school, we text eachother just about all day most of the day. Problem(s) are/is he is 3 years older than me, we haven't seen him since last halloween.  Yet he wants me to be his girlfriend??
I like this guy, but he doesn't live near me. We met over the internet. But he use to have feelings for me, and now he doesn't. I'm sorta loosing those feelings for him, but I still want to be his friend. What do I do?
I love the show If You really Knew Me. i see alot of my friends posting about it on facebook too. But the thing is, some of the people who post about it, including me, are the people who spread the gossip and start the drama. I feel like a hypocrite.
i love this boy but he left me cuz he says he feels nothing anymore and i am so devistated what am i supposed to do about this he says move on but its so hard 
I have a boyfriend and we have been together for 5 months now' we see eachother every day & if we arent with eachtoher we text none stop. we like how much we talk' he's always the one to text me first and i dont mind, is it 2 much? honest every day.
My bf of almost 2 yrs often tells me about other people trying to fix him up w/ other girls and other girls asking him out. He even added one of the girls to his fb after she had asked him out and he knew it would make me mad.it like he wnt me 2b mad
I have a birthmark and I am so afraid to change in the locker room and go to pool partys because the people at my school are VERY judgemental and I am afraid of being made fun of WHAT SHOULD I DO I want to be myself, but i cant and i am need HELP
I had my first boyfriend and started being a total jerk to me. He broke my heart. Since then I feel that I don't want to put my self out there emotionally so I let guys fall in love with me but I don't want to put myself out there to be hurt again.
There is a girl at school and she is constantly upset with me because she thinks I like her boyfriend. She even has her friends texting me telling me to stay away from him. But her bf and I are just friends. What am I supposed to do?
A girl constantly brings me down and knows how to ruin my life. Everyone loves her so she has control on them. I currently have two friends and has been that way for two years now.

After being in a relationship for over a year I have come to the decision that I like being single better. I want my freedom. But I don't want to lead girls on. I wan't to have them in my life. Should I forget about this being single thing or not?

I'm dating an older guy. My parents are totally okay with it, but my siblings aren't. We're not doing anything wrong, as in sexually, but they still don't like it. Should I just ignore the things they say? Or talk to them about how happy I am?

"People at my school consider me as ""Popular"" , I hate when I am categorized as that. I just dont like that. I think it's a dumb way to be known for. I just have friends all over & happen to know alot of people that's it. "
So Ive been with this guy for about 2 years and I really love him and he loves me. So we talked about having sex and I'm ready and so is he. Should we have sex and I am 19.
My bestfriend of half my life decided to hate me after the boy she liked asked me to be his girl friend. Not only did she start to hate me, she literally told the entire school i backstabbed her and turned everyone against me. I literally w

Lately I've been feeling so horrible aboutmyself I couldnt find anything there that fit me in forever21(it was either toobig or too small)... It made me feel like I need to loose weight... all the girls around me are twigs... Its very un-nerving..
This person I know is always getting into my business by checking around Facebook and posts stuff on her wall saying things about me but without saying my name.
I used to get alot of attention from boys on facebook. my boyfriend says i spend too much time on there ONLY when he found out about the attention. I deactivated it so he could shutup. i want to get back on there Am i the one with the problem or him?
One day,me and my two friends went to a friends house and posted something bad about a girl we didnt like. She got really upset,and i think the school might get involved. But it wasnt my idea. But i still fell guilty that i didnt say no.
My boyfrend always thinks im doing something im not suppose to be doing and its annoying now. I mean i love him with all my heart but i can hardly go out without him thinking im doin something stupid...what should i do?
After havin many friends d 1st yr of my new skool 1 girl got jealous and turnd evry 1 of those friends agaisnt me Its hard to cope with that fact when you realize that now your all alone in this world b/c of ignorant ppl making me depressed n emo
After watching if you really knew me i really see how much other people take to heart the things you say! I say i am in the popular but mean group at our school! i always say stuff to other kids to try to fit in with my group but i am done! 
ever since 6th grade, ive been called gay, **** and whatever else. ive always felt depressed, secluded. i dont think i could ever change this at my school.lets just say i think i know how it feels to stand before an overwhelming problem.
Im in school people know im th total beast girl. Im really good at sports. They think th littles commnt that they say to me will make me mad. I have angr issues. I DO HELP!!!
im one of the popular sophmore girls at school, but the reason im popular is because im nice to people. i dont understand why some people are mean to me though, and label me? is it jealousy? i never did anything to them.
Today i told mii crush that i like him,  he told mii the he likes mii too but doesnt want to put our friendship on the line. is this good or bad?
i like thisguy, we tell eachother everythn and are bestfriends he knos i like him.butmy friend is his ex,wen i told herbout him she said she didnt care,i found out deywere kissing and dat hurt me,we stopped talkn we onlytxt butwe never talkn inskool.
Well. I Ws In love with this Guy.. He was Perfect for me. But i thought we broke up.. When we really didnt. So  I got a new Boyfriend And He Found out i cheated.. He broke up with me but i cat gert over him. 
"People are always leaving me last because I'm always loud and seem happy. When I broke down once in front of my ""best friends"" during lunch, no one cared about how i felt at all. Everyone just kept going on to their classes like I wasn't even here."
we i use to be friends with this girl .. and then we stop being friend she gave everybody in her family my number they have been call me every since school gotten out but while we were in school she did this and they send hateful txt and call
"I was speaking to a girls ex boyfriend at school registration and he told me that shes a drama queen now hes blaming me for it so, she messaged me on myyearbook saying ""I'm a ******drama queen now huh?"" I mean why does it have to be on the internet"
People always talk about how skinny i am and make rumors that im suffering from anorexia it is really starting to get on my nerves. They always talk about how i need to start eating more mcdonalds. I try not to let it get to me but it always does. 
I'm 14 and I have never kissed a boy. Is it over the line (As in i should have done it already) or is it okay? I just feel like a loser compared to other people, it seems like people have such high expectations now.. 
"So, I've been ""talking"" to this guy for awhile. Today, we were IM'ing eachother and all the sudden he tells me he has a girlfiriend. I feel like crying. :("
"My mom won't listen to my music on her radio but when my sister is listening to Pop or something, she'll listen to that. She always says ""Turn that garbage off!"" but with my sister she won't even say a word. Favoritism or critisism? It ******* me off!"
I am always talking to guys that I haven't met eith on Facebook or I get their number and text them, and they always ask for a pic. So I send it to them, but im fully clothed. Is that still over the line?
I'm actually typing this because sometimes I've said things about people and if they find out & ask me about it I act like I never even said anything. After watching this show I realized that its important to be nice & own up to things if you say it!
alot of people have talked trash to me over the internet i just dont take it to heart bacause if you dont have the guts to say it to my face then, theres no reason for me too get mad
There has always been a voice in the back of my head saying that you like guys.For so long I can remember I have tried to run from that voice.I think I might be gay and I am scared to talk about it. I feel sucluded and lonely do to these feelings.
"My grandpa died in 2006 in a car crash and after that  I didnt understand because  I didnt know what was going on but I dont have that much courage for myself like they say "" STRONGER WITH EACH TEAR""."
"If you really knew me you would understand then and now I have had issues letting myself out but I just want  to ""thank over line"" to give that courage after my grandpa passed "
This year I am going  to be a better person and not let my emotions get to me because I got into lots of fights last yr and people started gaining me a reputation as a bully.Now I know what people go through  and suffer from on IF YOU REALLY KNEW ME 
If you really knew me you would know people always teese me because I'm over weight. I can be very mean to people because I just want to fit in. I'm not a mean person at all. So I'm going to be happy with myself and not try to fit in and be nice . 
my boyfriend and i were fighting then we started to talk about how its dumb why we are fighting and he asked me to send him a naked photo of myself and i said no im woultd never do that i love him but he could send it to his friends 
sometimes i wish i could just take back everything ive done and start on a clean fresh page

Im about to start high school  and i am worried because I have already been teased and looked at in a funny way. I just don't know what to do. i am hoping though that i will start clean in high school and people won't judge me and crap like that..
This happend during this school year. Everyone is jelous of me at my high school, because i'm honestly really pretty, you know the kind: blond girl with blue eyes, yep really hot and gorgeous. The ohter girls got mad at me and broke my lipsticks :(((
If you really knew me you'd know I keep ALL my feelings on the inside. & Cover them with a fake smile. But strong people need to brake down sometimes. & what makes it difficult to stay strong is when you care for everyone..yet no one cares for you..
If you really knew me, you'd know that I'm constantly ridiculed because of my sexuality. Even though I may not have the same rights, like be able to marry the one I truely love. I'm GAY and happy! Nothing you say will make me change!
I'm hopin to make more friends becus im goin 2 b a softee but i had changed schools so it got hard to make friends, I am going to change my looks and see if I impress, or should i be myself? advice? :/
whenever  i  have something wrong like terribly wrong going on i usually keep it to myself till it comes out in a way i DONT want it to.
Im Very quiet and very mature. i do think of things before i do or say anything. at my school, i dont fit in. everybody parties. drinking has just gotten over the limit! is it really cool to party and get MIPs or be mature about highschool years?
if you really knew me you would know that i keep all my feelings bottled up inside because anythime i get close to someone they hurt me even my family and friends. 
If you really knew me you would know that im just dating this guy because i like saying i have a boyfrien. We have nothing in common 
if you you really knew me you would know that even though i have alot of friends and family i feel so alone like no one understands me or what im going thru. 
If you really knew me you would know that i hate the small town i live in. You make one mistake and everyone in your school remembers it for years to come. You would know that im not quiet and that i am actually pretty funny. 
I am gay lots of the time Im scared to come out cuz of what ppl might think or my reputation I no I shouldnt care but in a society like today's it's hard not to. I'm even afraid to come out to my parents because I'm afraid they might disown me. 
If you really knew me you'd know that I answer my phone no matter who it is. Because the one time I didn't was the time that my friend needed me. That's also why im nice to everyone and smile at every person I see. 
if you really knew me you'd know even though i have alot of friends and seem happy all the time i always feel like i dont have any true friends and most of the time im not actually happy. i have a huge wall up 
i let the greatest guy ever in my life just go . its the one thing i ever regret doing . no one has treated me so good i dont even know why i ended it. worst part he didnt even try changing my mind.. he just let me go and says he still cares. yaright
looking on my bf's facebook page and i was a really mean comment that i dont dare to repeate and it was about me and i just poasted there is a thin line between insult and injury and you crossed it tell me if it was the best was to handel it?
people always tell me im pretty and when i look in the mirror i feel pretty. but in pictures i think i look ugly. i always have to be careful of what i put on facebook and stuff because i dont want to look bad.
Well , i havee this guy i've talked to since thee 6th gradee . && we made  a promise to not to havee sex with anybody else . dose that me i'm a cheater if he isn't my boyfriend ? && should he be mad ?
if you really knew me. youd know that since my dad died that i moved somewhere else to start over fresh. but the people here were worse than the people back home. i wanted to end it all. but i found out who my real friends are. and now im stronger.
If u rly knew me ud kno that from 4-8 grade bullies ruined my life. ud know that ever since 7th grade ive wanted a girl to love and love me back. it took me until a few months ago to find her. i now have an amazing girlfriend. remember to be patient!
my bf is extremely jealous of my best friend who is a guy we have been dating for almost 8 months and he still questions me about cheating on him is that over the line?

I have always wanted to try sexting, but I thought it was when you just text what you would do to each other, I had no idea that you had to send pics. So I just did sexting without sending pictures but it still felt wrong...
my best guyfriend(same age)wants us to be eachothers first time. i really like him &trust him so i think thats a good idea. we talk about it alot &he listens to my worries and he is even willing to wait for whenever im ready is this over the line?

My best friend and i liked each other for a long time. I moved and we started a long distance relationship, I am still waiting for her and she says she is waiting for me. But she has dated 3 other guys. still like her but should i move on
The guy that I was madly in love with treated me like crap for year and 4 years later he is trying to be nice and talk to me again, I still have feeling for him but I still have a lot of anger towards him, and i can help but be mean when we talk.
My ex & I have known eachother since 1st grade. We started going out about 2 years ago. He & I were really off & on. He would flirt with other girls, & I'd flirt with other guys. We're over now & he's my bestfriend. Is it ok to love him still?
I have a friend that I am with almost every day. He's developed a crush on me and on Canada day he tried to make a move. He saw me cuddling with someone and now always guilt trips me about his sad life. Is he over the line or just hurting inside?

so one of my best friends and this guy were talking and they thought they loved each other.he broke it of because he couldnt be committed.now he likes me and i like him.but she doesnt know. am i a horrible friend? whats the difference btw her and me?
I've been talking to this boy who likes me, and we're becoming good friends. But the boy I loved for three years is starting to decide he wants to date. What do I do? Stick with someone I like and is new to me, or someone I love and is from the past.
My boyfriend and I have sexted before..but only words, but we both delete everything..he's asked me for pictures of me in a bathing suit, but I said no and he didn't pressure me. I still feel guilty for saying inappropiate things, should I?

People have problems because you care too much about what others think, you aren't confident or courageous enough, you don't think before your actions, you're not grateful, and you over think things.

I have gotten into many internet disputes over the years. Since then  I have become more mature and relized that fighting online is lame. If you have a arguement over a social networking program, you should simply handle it maturely face to face.

On myspace my friend A was dating S for abut 3 months then J stepped in the picture. J and S started to like each other. A told me so I got online, talked to J she said A's a ***. I said *** .Then she said typo sorry.
My experience taught me that texting and messages on Myspace aren't the best way of communicating. It's difficult to perceive the tone intented in the text. We may misunderstand something and then say things we don't mean and can't take back.

I still have feelings for my ex. But he keeps saying he wants to start over with the basic friendship because we had  a nasty break up. is he just using that as an excuse to be w/ other girls. he's my best friend, but i love him still. idk what to do
the other night i had a dream about my best friend's boyfriend (who is also my best friend) and we were kissing And the next day i hung out with them together, and just how he was, i think im starting to like him, but i love my best friends together
I saw this girl and for some reason I was attracted to her. I'm straight and I've never felt this way about a girl. She isn't drop dead gorgeous or anything it's just that, she's pretty much exactly what I would look for in a guy.
So im in love with this boy. He and i went out, and then broke up. he's differnt from everyone here where i love. I love him, but Hes going for this ***** i hate, and now hes being so rude to me i love him, and how sweeet he was. what do i do? ):

FORMSPRING = best way to get harrassed online. I have no idea why anyone would sign up to get bullied over the internet. Just saying.
I called someone a bad name
I really like this girl. But all my friends call me a loser and say i have no chance. Should i tell her how i feel?
I feel left out. What happened to my friends? 
I keep telling my girl her behavior that bothers me. She keeps doing it, so I keep telling her over and over about 3-4 times now in different ways(nicely, with a tone, and stern).Instead of changing her behavior, she tells me I am picking on her. 
My best friend is amazing and she is so happy with her bf but idk what to do because her bf is gay but in the closet, I know he is because 2 of my ex's said that they hooked up with him. Should I tell her? I don't want to out him.
A guy has a girlfriend but is hitting on another girl at my school
My boyfriend and I might be breaking up soon, and there's another boy I like. Would it be okay to get with him right after breaking up with my current boyfriend? How soon is too soon?
My boyfriend and I live far away from each other. He always wants me to talk to him when I have free time. If I don't respond for a while cause I'm busy he gets really sad and he complains. I think we have enough time to talk but he doesn't.
I think my fren is trying to steal away three of my frenns cuz they r ignoring me more now..we use to be so close.But idk way to do now. I wanna cry but I can't. I need advice :(
i think bullying in school this days are stupid and childish because many kids dont know what they are saying. and if someone is bullying for who you are dont worry about them. worry about people who love you for who you are:)

Guys and Girls, from experiences with bully's and trash talkers.. All I can say is that it's wrong. Everyone thats posting on here keep posting because your stories can help other's just like us. You guys are awsome because your not afraid to say no!
My friends friend know this guy who lives in a neighboring town. Hes older then me though. I've never actually met him but we message eachother alot. He makes me feel happy, like someone actually cares bout me and understands me. He wants to meet me?
As someone who faced constant bullying, I understand what so many of you are going through.  It really does get better!  Once you leave the world of adolescent *** and go into the real world, you'll find people who really do respect your individuality

I don't love my bf anymore, I already told him but he depressed. I didnt't wanted to hurt him so I told him that it was a mistake. Days later, my ex started to talk with me again and I think I still love him, but I don't want to hurt my bf again. HELP!
Ok I like this boy for a couple years now, he is my best friend and we do everything together. Last year on the 4th of July we were deciding to go out or not but if we broke up we did not want to ruin our friendship but I spend everyday with him. 
I do graffiti and I was wondering what your guys view on it was. Im actually good at it too
can you shave down there? as in pub hair
I dated my ex for 7 months. but knew him for almost a year. over a month ago he said he wants to take a break. I lost my virginity to him and he used to always say that were gonna be together forever, he never talks to me anymore. i miss him soo much
When my friend moved away for a cemester. During that time i joined a gang without telling her. When she moved back i told her. She said it was fine But after a few weeks she said she couldnt handle all the fone calls and me never being able to hang.
Is it ever to late to apologize
I still like my ex but he never texts me or anything  so i broke up with him... But when im with him and person its just about us and its like nobody else matters. Should i take him back??
i have the most amazing bf and i love him, but i still miss my ex. even though he cheated on me and lied to me.  He was a jerk a lot of the time, but I just can't help but miss him.  I'm worried I'll never really get over him and idk what to do.

 I often feel like Im not good enough but I try to feel confident with myself, I have great role models who inspire me and its my goal in life to help people know they are good enough and they dont need to change for anyone. STAY STRONG EVERYONE! (L)

I don't know what's wrong with me but I feel lonely ugly and fat and people be tellinq me that I'm skinny cute and have alot of luv from my friends idk what wrong with me but i don't feel good about my self
Okay so I've been in Maine and am staying here for a week and went to a fair... In the afternoon I met a guy named Ken he is sweet but he left then I met a amazing guy named *** and he was sweet but he is my cousins friend addvice ?
I'm guessing true love happens when you are in a different state): I wished I lived here !
At the fair last night. My two cousins  came with me. They are beautiful and I'm not. Well that's what I think. All the boys go crazy over them and  then I'm the third wheel again. The same thing happened a year ago at the fair. Any help? 
There is a guy I really really like but he has a crush on my cousin. She is beautiful and I'm well I'm me. People say I'm pretty but I think They r just saying that. Any help? I am in love with the guy. HELP! 
I had a friend of mine get mad at me. She began sending me texts saying how awful I am, and what a terriable person I am. At frist I was just like I get it, your mad. I hoped if she just got all of it off her chest then it would be done with. 
"Cyberbullying is the worst experience someone can be put through. In May, 2 girls who were my friends decided to take a photo of me during school, post it on facebook & post mean comments. They wrote things like ""i luvv this photo!""&""she's so sexi!"""
i like this guy and im not saying hes ugly but hes not the hottest guy ever. im afraid that if i date him and get serious with him my friends will make fun of us. but i really like him and i want to be with him
If you really knew me, you'd know that it's incredibly hard for me to open up to anyone.  Everyone i've opened up to has betrayed me and i can't set myself up for that pain anymore.
It blows when u fall for your best friend and he lives 200 miles away. It won't work. But when he found someone else that would make him happy and love him,it tore me apart. I would die for him and I almost did.Because of her we are we r not friends 
I'm 5ft 6in tall and I way 135lbs is that bad because I think it is,..,
So I just started high school and the bad thing is I'm 16 ppl make fun of me but it wasn't my fault any good advice on how not to take offence
So I'm talking to this guy but I really don't like himm but my best friend set us up and the bad thing is I really like someone else what should. I do!!!!!!!!!!!

I've recently accepted that I'm gay. I'm still a little uncomfortable with telling my friends for they are judgmental. Should I stay in the dark or live my life openly and start to be ok with people knowing about my orientation?

There's this guy that I had a thing with last school year but it was kinda a secret. I think he just wanted to have sex and I said no and he still kept talking to me and what not.he keeps coming in to my life and idk what it means
I have a boyfriend but I also like my closest male friend but he does not like me back more than a friend my male friend I mean
I met up with a guy I met online for the second time and we made out. Hes always sweet and kind when texting but he acts like he doesn't when we're In public. He asked me out so it's official,,
Most times I just want to be alone. As long as I have my music, I'm okay. I feel like I'm always being judged. I drift away from those closest to me because I'm afraid to trust. I've been hurt 2 many times b4 so this is my way of protecting myself.
Ok I'm dating this guy we have been dating for just about 4 months and he calls me babe but only when he is by our friends but keeps it secret when around others I don't even have a cute little name stored in his phone just my first nd last. Advice?!
OKAi, iAM A 9O Year Old Woman. I Am Sittin In Class Wiff This ChiK, Sh3's Beinqg Really Mean, ): It is OVAA THAA LiNE. /3
He had surgery today then ended up down the block from me and when he finally got here he left not even five mins later.. Why is it that I feel like my time in seeing him is limited??!! Advice?
When people, even my friends go through my phone or something iKinda get irritatated. Like why do people like searching phones/history or w.e. Geez they might find something they dont like
"Everyone(Well Majority) of people do and act in ""suggestive"" manners. So why do they get offended or feel a certain way when a situation happens because of their doings? Like they asked for it"
there was this one girl  that started fighting with me over Facebook about a status i posted.  I'm sad to say i fought back.  I saw her recently and she acted like nothing ever happened.  I hate that i stooped to that level.
"If I'm not loud I'm invisible and if I'm not happy I'm apparently ""depressed"". Seriously, sorry for forgetting to smile. But the only time I'm really happy with is when I'm with him but I doubt he knows that "
I'm a very loud and hyper person that appears to not have a care in the world. I only do that because once I'm quite I remember things and I become really depressed. Idk what to do to stay happy.. please help 
Ok so i went to a teen dance this friday and i danced with this guy and he likes me now.But im not sure if i like him im like 1/2 the size of him and i only did it to make my ex mad so he woupd leave. I feel bad but i love him as a friend ? Do i do?
i once used to talk meanly to this girl online but she was sooo mean to me (and her twin sister) in person, i was bullied. Me and her would just go back and forth online, i feel bad now 
So I'm just now getting back into the dating seen because emu bf of a year cheated on me a while back. I'm a junior in high school and there is this freshmen who im into and this senior who I'm into. Idk what to do one is sweet and the other is sexy 
My Friend Maria I Think She Stealing My Friends And Crush..... :(
"A few of my ""friends"" were mean to a girl just because she was fat. I called them out and walked away with the girl. :)"
My friend was looking at my texts and saw that I was planning a sleepover with my other friend and Kristy got mad at me for not including her.She shouldnt be looking at my texts and I never gave her my password to my phone but she knows it anyways.
I'm falling for my bestfriend and she knows it, everyone says we should go out. But, I feel like she's playing with me. She either treats me really good or she treats me like crap. We argue too, for the dumbest things! I just don't know what to do.
"Okay, so i was at my friends house with another girl. When my friend wasnt looking, the girl said ""I thought these people were rich."" I told my friend and the girl denies everything about it.. Is she under the line or over?"
when i was in elementary school, i was underweight, and now i'm at a normal weight, but my stomach isn't exttremly flat. i get called fat all the time and these two boys pass me in the halls and call me chunk. i dont eat lunch or breakfast anymore.
i feel like i keep falling into this dark hole. i feel so alone. all i ever wanted was for people to accept me but no one ever does. they talk behind my back and i just want to scream. i want to find someone that can just tell me itll be ok. 
WORTHLESS is what i saw online. To feel so low that you have to bring someone down to your level must be a sad existence I am here to say that i want every person in the world to read this nd know that your life is precious and to please cherish it.
Im 14 and never had my first kiss. I never have had a boyfriend over 3 weeks and i haven't had me first date. I feel ugly and no one cares about me. Should i worry about these things or am i too young to worry?
Hi Im Seventeen Years Old And I Have No Idea Whats Wrong WIth Me. I Watched Disconnected And It Touched Meh Because I Have Thought About Suicide And This Movie Made Me Realize That My Life Is Really Precious. Thank You
Me and my friends got into a fight with a kid from my grade. He never had alot of friends and we didnt like him so we made a post on Facebook about him he commented saying he was going to kill himself. I still feel so lucky he didnt.
 my Brothers story.... Him and his girlfriend got pregnant, she aborted the baby and told him, she didn't want to bring the devil's baby into the world, he threatned suicide, she taunted him and pushed him for months...RIP *** 10/25/90-10/01/2011
I'm completely in love with the guy I lost my virginity to. We're best friends but he moved away and now his best friend talks to me all the time and wants to hang out. What should I do?
taking ur life is not the right decision. my dad commited suicide when i was 9. my mom left me when i was 15 there were many times i have wanted 2 kill my self but my life is worth living & so is yours ! it is selfish & effects people forever !
This isn't about online..but I have a friend and her boyfriend is terrible. He hits her, spits on her, but on top of that..he treats her like crap. She deserves better but she wont listen to me. She sees the problem, even admits it, but wont change?
In high school, I would be made fun of DAILY cuz of the size of my nose.. I hated myself and every1 at my school. When I looked in the mirror, I hated what I saw.. I had a nose-job but I now suffer from depression over it and it's tough at times. 
since i was 7 i got mixed into all things that i was not supposed to at my age so it dragged me into a bad time but now im actually a dj and stayed off that track bc ive learned to tho im in clubs and all that i still stopped everything so thats good
everyone loves me i have no problems 
Love is a strong word , dont let control yo life,
I'm falling for my bestfriend. He knows it too. We've been 'talking' for a few months now & i don't know if its just for fun or if it'll eventally go somewhere. What should i do? 
I posted a photo online before, for a site I thought I knew everyone. I was wrong because once everyone saw the photo, I was seen different. Its been over 3 years and I have learned from my mistake. I will be a role model for my little sister now! (:
My boyfriend won't give me a back massage. 
im a military wife and a mommy. ive been with my husband for 3yrs and we got married in march. but ever since ive gave birth to my baby back in may. i feel that my husband isnt attracted to me anymore cuz of the weight gain and stretchmarks. 
So I like this guy and he likes me and we have made out Dexter and are gonna have sex but I like this other guy a senior and I don't know ht to do because with all the stuff going on in my life this guy or fwb makes me forget bout everything
"At school there are these group of guys who always make fun of me because im in between (not fat but not ""skinny"") and one day I told everyone their secrets and they stopped but now i feel bad even though they made fun of me for years. WAS I RIGHT?"
I've been dating this guy for nearly 6 months now. We are so caught up with each other. But sometimes, it's still hard to trust him. Any suggestions on how I could help myself, because I love him too much to lose him.
I've been around typing in chat rooms, reading and posting comments on my deviantart page. I've even been in game rooms where you interract with people using IM's. I'm no saint myself, but  if I ever typed something mean and cruel it was to stand up

At my school, teachers were trying to raise awareness about GLBT youth. When they brought the issue up to the principal, he said that there were no students who had those identities at the school. He wasn't being mean, he just didn't know.
