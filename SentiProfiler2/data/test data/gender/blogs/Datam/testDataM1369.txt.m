what can i say abt this guy..well.. 1st things 1st- ' he's crazy'... he also keeps smiling.. an amazing gift that is..i would say.. sometimes damn excited and always puts lots of mokkai.. but u would still smile.. sometimes down to earth.. he's damn good at accounting.. the best is- can play an amazing range of games.. if he puts his mind to somethin, then consider it done.. he's got determination man.. what he need is ambition.. still none can change the fact that he remains one of the most eccentric,foolish, funny ,intelligent characters i've ever seen.. you got a fan here dude.
