Well it's that time again!  Time for me to come up with another excuse as to why I have nothing to show you all.
This week, it is simply that I have been too busy with work (as in trying to make money while unemployed), and research.  The research here is actually more important than that of simply drawing and animating, which is why I have not finished anything this week.  I have paid the DAVE school (that's "Digital Animation & Visual Effects School" for those who haven't heard) down in Orlando Florida, a little visit.
Upon checking into our hotel room, we called one of the DAVE school representatives, who happens to also be a 3rd block student, I'll go into blocks a little more later.  He was kind enough to pick us up, drive us around town a little, give us a tour of the school, and answer some of our questions.
DAVE school is located on the back side of Universal Studios Orlando, on the premises.  It is not inside the gate to the back of the park, but it is on their back lot.  While they are on Universal's property, they are not owned by Universal but have a good relationship with them.  Students get employee-like passes to let them into the back side of the park, where they can go on rides, enjoy the shows, or even eat in the staff cafeteria, which I am told has VERY reasonable prices.  Fun aside, the school is currently in a sound stage which they converted for teaching classes.  Despite this, it is decently equipped, with a mocap (motion capture) studio, green screen, small theater, and dozens of work stations.  The front room is the entry where their receptionist can help with anything you need.  Next to this is the guest lounge, where they show off all the movies, posters, toys, et al that they have made.  They also have an impressive collection of student awards on display.
