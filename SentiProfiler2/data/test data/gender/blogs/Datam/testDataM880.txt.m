Heard a song today called Unfaithful. Not sure who sang it originally but Rhianna does it now. It's about a girl that is unfaithful to her lover. Seems like I lived my whole life like that. Not a single girl being even the least bit faithful to me. They all cheated on me. It's a good song. I can actually say I sympathize for the lover in the song cause I went what he went through every single time.

My niece is starting to show new actions that show her evolution from baby to actual child. I watched her today move her car seat to the little table and place her little pooh bear or baby as she calls it into the seat. Then she placed a bowl of little gold fish crackers in front of it then walked over and sat down in her own little chair that my father built and started eating from her own bowl. She would get up occasionally and take the little wet cloth that we used to clean her face with and use it on the "baby" to clean its face with.
