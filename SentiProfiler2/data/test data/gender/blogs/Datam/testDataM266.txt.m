I gave a talk at the New Museum in New York City on Saturday, along with Omar Wasow, the co-founder of Black Planet. It was good fun – Omar and I are nerds of the same generation, and as he showed slides of his beloved VIC-20, I found myself throwing devil horns in a gesture of 8-bit solidarity. The talk was… sparsely… attended. Which is to say, the two friends from Global Voices who came to support me represented a third of the paying audience. And while this can be a bit dispiriting, Lova Rakotomalala was kind enough not only to attend, but to videotape the beginning of the discussion, which is now posted on his blog. (For those of you who can’t get enough video of me – and, frankly, you should seek professional help – Saturday’s talk was descended in part from my Berkman talk on mapping infrastructure and flow, available here.) And the conversation Omar, Lova, Solana Larsen and others had afterwards at the museum, and later over drinks, made for an extremely rewarding seminar experience, if not the grand NYC lecture I might have been hoping for. Anyway… the talk tried to draw a line between the idea that we should study what people actually do online, rather than what we might hope they would do, to the phenomenon of social translation. As I put slides together, I kept coming back to a talk Zhang Lei gave at the China Internet Research conference. He was making the argument that, while Chinese-speaking internet users may now represent the largest group of internet users, there’s probably much less Chinese-language content than English language. As Lei admitted, we don’t really know that this is true, however. It’s really hard to get an answer to the question, “What percent of the internet is in English? In Chinese?” Near as I can tell, the last time anyone made a serious, rigorous attempt to answer the question was a study by Excite AtHome in 1999, which looked at 600 million webpages and concluded that 72% were in English. (If I’m wrong and missing the obvious, definitive study, please let me know in the comments – would love to know about it.) I haven’t found that study, but it’s referred to in an excellent piece in the American Prospect – “Will the Internet Always Speak English?” – and might be part of the study announced here, which looks at a wide range of research questions around a corpus of Excite data. If Excite’s estimates were right, and the Internet was 72% English in 1999, it’s probably much less so now – in the past decade, the ITU estimates that internet penetration has almost tripled, and much of this growth has been in countries where English isn’t the predominant language. The rise of read/write web technologies like blogs have made it far easier for people to author content in their native languages. While the NITLE blog census, last updated in 2003, saw English, followed by Catalan (?!), as the dominant languages in the blogosphere, Technorati’s “State of the Live Web” in 2007 saw English as a plurality, roughly tied with Japanese… and I believe Technorati’s methods missed lots of Chinese blogs and undercounted them. Still,
