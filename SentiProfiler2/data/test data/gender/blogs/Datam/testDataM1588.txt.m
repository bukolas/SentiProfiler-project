Most photographers would balk at spending $2K for a fixed-lens digital camera, but Leica has a large following, and the Leica X1 ($1,995 list) will find a happy home with many of the company's devotees. Like the Leica M8 ($5,995 list), the X1 features an APS-C image sensor—the same size sensor found in much larger digital SLR cameras, such as the Editors' Choice Canon EOS Rebel T1i ($899.99, )—capable of producing D-SLR-quality images. Though Leica priced the X1 at a fraction of the M8, image quality is still top notch. But when you compare it to cameras from other manufacturers, such as the Lumix DMC-GF1 ($899.99, ) from Panasonic, the X1 becomes much less attractive. Though you won't find a camera as small as the X1 with comparable image quality, you can spend far less on larger cameras that offer more features, comparable image quality, faster autofocus, no shutter lag, interchangeable lenses, higher resolution LCDs and HD video capture.
