purchased this camcorder as a gift for my cousin. I am always impressed with Canon's advanced technology and strong commitment to best quality. The picture quality outside in a bright, sunny day is amazingly sharp and the Image Stabilization feature works pretty well if you have a shaky hand like me while shooting. To shoot a scene indoors in a low light, the picture is kind of grainy, but still much better than a Panasonic camcorder at the same price range.
