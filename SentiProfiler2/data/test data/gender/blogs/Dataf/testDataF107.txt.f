Oh how I love this boy! Gordon is such a sweet boy. This morning when we were eating breakfast I told them that there was no fighting on Valentine's Day, only loving and kissing. Gordon immediately got off his chair and started kissing my arm. He is my little snuggle bug. Not a day goes by when he doesn't curl up on my lap and snuggle with me.

If anyone comes to our house, Gordon will undoubtedly give them a hug. He likes to play house and is always the baby because "the baby gets to be held and rocked and loved". (I think it might also have something to do with the fact that babies don't really do anything.)

Gordon has recently started reading and is so enthralled in letters. He likes to sound out words and his favorite word to spell is "pop". We were talking about the nice things we could do for the others in our family and Gordon whispered to me, "Can I give them pop?" I told him it would be fine and now we are all finding little papers with "pop" written on them from Gordon. I love finding those papers!

We recently registered Gordon for Kindergarten. I know he is excited to go and I am sure he will be just fine. I also notice how different he is from the other boys his age. While they all want to play Star Wars or Batman, Gordon is happy to talk about Winnie the Pooh or play house and be the baby. 

Hopefully the law isn't so strict that my "Touch Love Language" little boy can get a few hugs from his teacher. If not, I will be handing them out before and after school.
