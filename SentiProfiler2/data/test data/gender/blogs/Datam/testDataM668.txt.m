I worked on this one on location for about about 3 hours earlier today. I found the scene and composition difficult to handle, and finished it up tonight in the studio with about 2 more hours work. The top of these limestone outcroppings were covered in moss, as was a lot of the tree trunks where they emerged from the ground, and most of the rocks."Outcropping"20" x 30", oil on linen(Here's a re-do on this one. I didn't like where it was and decided to attack it. It's only paint and canvas. The original is below the adjusted painting.) Here's another snow painting from the southeastern part of Cumberland County, Kentucky, very close to Dale Hollow Lake State Resort Park. The road that travels through this small valley is Davidson Road. Did this one from a photograph I took recently."Dusting"20" x 24", oil on linen Went back to a little stream in the woods today. Didn't think it was that cold when I first went out, but before long was warming my hands in gloves.
