A typical down to earth girl , known for her weird sense of humour.. I have known her for the past 5 years and she has become an integral part of my life. Ever smiling,Modest,Hard working,Compatible,Cares for every person around her, always lends a helping hand, very enthusiastic,on the whole a total Sweet heart.. That’s Nivi for me. Not even a single day had passed without talking to her. One person whose wave length matches exactly with mine.We have had loads and loads of fun together, hours and hours of vetti arattai, night overs, oor suthuals,combined studies,done lots of crazy things and partners in crime for every damn thing.. 4 years of coll life was amazing. i would treasure them for life!!.
She’s all what a gr8 friend should be and means a lot to me. Happy birthday dear.A Small gift on your birthday...Keep Rocking!!
