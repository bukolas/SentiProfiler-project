IN A NUTSHELL: WE HAVE USED THE MODEL #22205 DAILY SINCE 1997

The model 22205 is almost an exact twin of the model offered here, except it was offered for sale to us in 1997. We have 5 children and this brave little toaster has seen alot of service since 1997 without a single problem.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: 900 WATTS - WHITE ENAMEL FINISH - CRUMB TRAY

We have used and overused this little appliance and while 5 coffee makers and 3 'Foreman Grills' have worn out this toaster keeps toasting just like it always has.

CAUTION: HOT TO THE TOUCH

Like toasters of old, this one is hot to the touch with only thin metal and white baked enamel between your fingers and the red hot nichrome filaments that are powered by 900 watts of electricity. Actually, it was the 900 watts versus 7-800 watts of other toasters that got me to buy this in the first place. It even has a crumb bin! Well, 9.5 years and counting, but soon we may want to replace it for a 'cool-touch', though I think we will always keep this brave little toaster around for sentimental reasons.
