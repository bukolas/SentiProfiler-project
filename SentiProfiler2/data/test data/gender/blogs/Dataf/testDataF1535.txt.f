I like...flipping my blankets over to the cold side when I sleep, the smell of sun-dried laundry, back scratches, food, the winter's first snowfall, beach days, wallowing in music on a gloomy, wet vancouver day, crazy moments with people that I am crazy for, nail polish, avocados, big warm hugs, large meadows that are frolick-a-ble, the summertime, qoola, french, leggings, tea, metal water bottles, school supply shopping, salmon cream cheese, and some days more than others - stepping out of my comfort zone.
