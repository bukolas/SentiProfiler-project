Life, ok, has its ups and downs. But can be truly amazing. Im sat in my room drinking good ole Sprite, and munching on galaxy cookie (: nom nom. But yehh, recently i haven't been feeling my usual happy self. The other night i sorta had a "breakdown" as such. And the people that helped me through it, were the people i would atleast expect. They helped me alot. They made me see the light again. Cus tbh they were right, I have the most amazing friends ever, ok they're will always be some people to put me down, most times, its for no good reason. Only to make themselves feel better, carry on, cus you ain't bringing me down. I know if i am ever down, my friends, are always there to pick me back up. I have a good bunch. My family, are my rocks tbqh. They are defo there for me through thick and thin (: Life can be cruel at times, and theres always something to make you feel like shit, but you gota remember, your never alone. They're are people out there who have no-one to turn to. So i guess im saying, im glad i do. I wouldn't be anything without you guys. I owe you everything. I love you.
