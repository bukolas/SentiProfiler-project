Or perhaps we should call this one the "non-sick,non-fatigued, non-fat,non-crazy" post. Ahh, honest writing. It's definitely not for everyone.So, we did something fun yesterday besides going to the Arboretum for the third time this week (the girls are loving it and keep asking to go back). I was sitting around with them after everyone was home for the evening and did a search on my flickr stream of each of the girl's names. What came up was a varied, non-sequential, virtual (Insert name here), This Is Your Life, "baby book" that was entirely delightful. I highly recommend it.
Don't have a flickr account? Here, borrow mine (featuring Anna Sofia):
