he MAC mini has been a great replacement server for my old Windows 2003 box.  It performs like a champ and with little to no maintenance.  I've had it running for over a year now (on 24/7 hosting several websites) and I have not had any problems.  I Upgraded the Ram to 2 gig and other than that I haven't done a thing to it.  I use a regular "pc" mouse, a mac wireless keyboard and a sony monitor.  It is the only server on my network of 2 laptops and 2 PC's.  I couldn't be happier with it and can't wait to upgrade to Leopard!
