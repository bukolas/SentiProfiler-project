52 Photowalks - I read about this project idea over here. The goal is to get out of the house once a week and walk around snapping photos. I'm hoping to do "themes" or "areas" for these walks and I have a list of ideas that I'm excited about - the difficulty will be finding time. My goal is to do almost all of these walks in the Philadelphia area so at the end of the year, I'll have covered a decent amount of the city and surrounding area. I've posted my first one over here although I haven't decided on a format for these yet. More to come later.
