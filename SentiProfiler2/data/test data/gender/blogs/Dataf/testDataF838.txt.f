Well, let's see. I am nothing special. Just an ordinary girl. The only thing that makes me special are my family, friends and my smoking hot boyfriend Ernie. Along with my mother I own and operate a automotive upholstery shop. We Rock. Yes we are that damned good at what we do. I don't always like it, but I do it well and I am proud of the work we do. I have two boys. 15 and 9. They are the force that holds my universe together. My duct tape. Both are beautiful, intelligent, caring wonderful kids and I am blessed to have them. There is also my niece who is 15. She lives here off and on, and we love her like crazy. I have a ton of other nieces as well. All are special and I wouldn't know what to do without any of them. My friends have saved me more than once. The ones here and the ones that live 10 miles up the road. Always there for me to lend a helping hand or an ear. They are fun and crazy and understand my weird sense of humor or else they are just laughing at me. Thank you all. Ernie came along when I least expected it and grabbed hold of my heart. I hope he never lets go. He has added joy to my life I didn't even know was missing. And I met him right here on Myspace. Guess that means I should be nicer to Tom, huh?
