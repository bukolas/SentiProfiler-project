Unfortunately, as all cancer patients know, you can never completely get away from your body's assault on itself.  Leading up to the book launch, my PSA started climbing quickly, evidence the cancer was actively spreading.  The day after the launch, I had another test and found it had jumped way past what it was when I was first diagnosed and we have been unable to pinpoint where it is growing, which is cause for much anxiety.  In the meantime, the pain in my back is increasing.  I tried another type of hormone in a bid to slow things down, but the side effects drove me off that after only a week.
