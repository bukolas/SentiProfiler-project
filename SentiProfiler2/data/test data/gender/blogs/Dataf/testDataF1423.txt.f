Wow, the US is gorgeous.....and big!  I just got back from a five day trip to Yellowstone National Park and The Grand Tetons with my 13 year old nephew.  What a fantastic trip! It is like bringing your 7th grade science class with you on tour.I generally knew what a Geyser was, but, well not exactly.  And the difference between a Geyser and a Hot Spring or Boiling Mud Pot?  No, not at all.  With land spontaneously spitting out steam and mud bubbles, you can see why a 13 year old boy had a fabulous time.
