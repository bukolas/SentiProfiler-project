If i were to use the word "give up", it doesn't seems to apply on me.
I don't exactly know what to do because at this moment, i can't solve this problem alone.
I need you God.
Please help me to overcome all these barriers for making me to feel this way.

When i get to see him, i feel all messed up.
My feelings go all ways, i don't feel good.
When i don't get to see him, you know, the feelings when you yearn to see someone so badly?
Wanting to know how is he doing and all.
But what about if the person is opposing you in everything you do?
I wanted to tell him that i hate him yesterday.
Because i'm lost for words.
I don't know what can i do to describe him anymore.
Maybe it's a good thing for him, but definitely a no for me.

God, you need to help me to persevere till the very end.


Realized something odd?
Yep, i've changed my blogskin. Something was wrong with the font from my previous blogskin.
And if you're a constant reader, you'd know this is the one i used before my previous's.
Anyway, i removed the chatbox. And dear friends, if you feel like commenting, sorry that i've to trouble you guys.
Please do comment below each posts i made.
Thank you.

I need a getaway.
