As several of you know . . . our older cat Jersey passed away in January. Jersey was 16 years old and had used up many of her 9 lives over the years. Liver problems, eating issues, a Hyperthyroid and old age to name a few of her challenges. Her kidneys decided to retire at the end of January. As sad as it was to put her down . . . we new it was time. She was a good girl and I miss her. ~~~~ This left our much younger cat Holly without a feline friend. We were informed by the local Humane Society that her brother was in foster care and would likely be available for adoption at the end of February. Last week we brought home Sidney. . . . Yes, as in "Sidney Crosby" for all you Canadian hockey fans :D. Sid the Kid scored the winning overtime goal for the Canadian Olympic Hockey Team. This active little guy will try his best to live up to his name sake. Looks a lot like his sister ~ don't you think? Double Trouble I guess :D He is 6 months younger though ~ same mother, different litter. ~~~~ Their mother is available at the Ottawa Humane Society if anyone is interested in adopting her. She prefers a family without dogs . . . so we chose the brother instead. As for my wonder pup Cider . . . she can't keep up with all this feline change. Big yawn! Just let me know when everyone is settled in she says. ~~~~ Many beautiful Lace and Linen Bridal Hankies are available in my Etsy Shop . I just love when vintage hankies retain their original stickers ~ Pure Linen ~ Made in Austria. It doesn't get much better than that! I also have the most beautiful Net Lace child's gown. It has a tiny separation at the shoulder that I need to mend before I list it . . . but just look at that lace! Absolutely Gorgeous! I have some Victorian Bloomers to list as well ~ pintucks and lace all around. Irish Crochet is a personal favourite! These hankies are just too pretty to use ~ perfect for your wedding day. I also listed this lovely tablecloth and napkin set recently. My new supervisor . . . she is very quiet and doesn't touch a thing :D She has learned to "stay" and watch while I photograph my work. How good is that ! Well, the meet and greet (existing dog ~ new cat) has been going quite slowly. Sweet little kitty has very sharp claws . . . . and Cider is not used to young cats that run at turbo speed. "Who me?" says Holly. My ability to trim those tiny little claws is also a work in progress. Holly is doing well using her scratching post, but it doesn't really trim her nails. So far the meetings have involved me holding Cider's collar and the cat keeping a respectful distance. We have progressed beyond the peeking door technique . . . but I can't hold the dog and use my camera, lol. I admitted to my daughter this week that I am indeed a bit nervous about the first unrestrained meeting. . . with no leash or collar involved. She assumed I was worried about the kitten (ha!) and recently realized I am actually more worried about the dog. Cider only has experience with declawed, geriatric cats. I think Cider is in for a shock when she discovers that cats do have claws. "OMG!" My daughter exclaimed. . . . "you're more worried about the dog!" Well . . . maybe, I replied. I have seen an upset cat jump on a dog's back before, with all four sets of claws digging in. Not so fun for our canine friends. So . . . slow and steady it goes. In the mean time Cider likes the new food bowls, new plush and feathery cat toys and bouncing balls with bells : ) I have had several requests recently for vintage hats . . . so I added several to my Etsy shop Rhinestones and Feathers . . . White Millinery . . . an Easter Bonnet perhaps. Pretty in Pink ~ Any Time of Year! Some wonderful Flapper shoes from the 1920s ~ Love those beaded Buckles And more velvet with embroidered detail. ~~~ Have a great weekend ~~~~ Thanks for visiting ~~~ ~~~ I have some lovely winter accents and pretty hats for sale in my Etsy Shop . There are still a few months of winter remaining in Canada. Maybe Ottawa should send some snow out West to help with the Winter Olympics. I hear the Apple trees are in blossom in Vancouver. Not so good for winter sports however. So . . . think snow . . . a few more months of winter yet : ) I have some very pretty Wool Scarves. Neutrals and pretty colours. Several nice shawls ~ handmade Crochet and Cashmere . . . Handmade sweaters from Scotland too! Warm and Pretty. ~ A few more months of Winter Woolies in Canada ~ Well . . . our new cat was keen to explore today . . . so what's a pet owner to do? "Do you want to meet the dog?" I asked her. I know you know there IS a dog. Likewise the dog knows there is a new cat. They most certainly know ~ even if they haven't met. So into the cat crate Holly went. I put her up high so she had a good view and would still feel safe. Cider and I have been reviewing our obedience training for the last few days to make sure she has that sit/stay in good form. Can you see Holly peeking out the side of the cat crate? I wish I could see Holly's face in this photo . . . .Wowza ~ what big ears you have! What a good sit-stay, Cider. Let's go back to playing with the 7 pounder for today. Much more relaxing. Jersey seems to have found her inner youth. So far so good : ) Holly's feline kennel cough is gone now so we have been working on introductions for the last few days. All the info I have read online about introducing new pets says to focus on one pet introduction at a time. We have a cat and a dog. Cider is our 80 pound dog. We decided to start small ~ with our little 7 pound cat. She's 15 years old and the living room is one of her favorite places to hang out . It is quiet and has lots of sunbeams from 9:00am to 3:00pm. This information was quickly shared with the new arrival. Today they made some progress. I'll let you sit on my chair with "my pillow" . . . . If I get first choice of any sunbeam I want. OK . . . . I'm easy to get along with. Relaxing in the proximity of the new pet is considered a very good sign. Jersey is right below this chair ~ so they are very close together. ~~~~ Now tell me about that dog that lives here . . . . (Oh . . . that's next week's lesson I think!) Back to work after the holidays ~ All the decorations are down and put away. It was nice to get back to work. I listed six coats today in my Ciderantiques Etsy Shop . I also paid a visit to the Background Fairy after seeing all her pretty backgrounds in blogland. I am having fun playing around with all the pretty options. Thank you Background Fairy! The coats and capes have all passed local inspection :D I have wool coats, capes and faux prints. Several different sizes to choose from. Mostly from the 1960s. Yep . . . definitely faux fur . . . says my helper. Hope you are warm and cozy ~ it was certainly cold here today.
