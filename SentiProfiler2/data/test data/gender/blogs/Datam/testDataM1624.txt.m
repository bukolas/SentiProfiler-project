Now I know why Cats kill Birds... 
Current mood: unwanted 
I don’t know what it is about the Birds but it seems like there's not enough room in their nest for me. Not only that but in their eyes the old wise owl is losing her wisdom and had led a cat into their tree. 
That’s not the worst part though... Mother Hen speaks of me as the creature. She speaks to me of me and see's me as no more than a nucience. I feel so ashamed and poorly of myself for I do not want to disturb the nest. All I want is to find a home. Not only a place to live, but a place I prefer to spend my free time instead of trying to find ways to stay out. A place where I am appreciated and loved for who I am, what I did, and what I am going to do. Instead, I am swarmed by Birds who claim that the cat is untidy and do nothing but stay around and eat. To me, their harsh continuous churpping hurts me more than a step on the tail. All I want is to forget the past and work for my future, but it seems even birds can’t do that...
