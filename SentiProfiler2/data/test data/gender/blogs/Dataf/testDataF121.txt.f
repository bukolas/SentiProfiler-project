Last week the DesignHER Momma household was in survival mode. Michael was in Europe for over a week and the kids and I were left to "fend" if you know what I mean. No grand-parental support was available for reinforcement; it was just the kids and I for 7 looooooong days.

I didn't blog about it at the time, because, you know, nothing spells I.D.I.O.T. more than declaring to the interweb that I'm home alone. I'm nobody's fool, yo.

I realized a few things while my husband was gone:

I don't know how single mom's do it. Let me say it again: I don't know how single moms do it. If you are one of them, I get on my knees and give you a big Waynes World "I'm not worthy."

I have the best friends in the world. A few of you totally bailed me out when I was at my craziest. I own you one (or ten).

Your body will really start to feel link junk after consecutive meals of alternating between chicken nuggets and frozen pizzas (accompanied by Diet Coke of course)

I actually really like having my husband around. No, not just to help out with the kids, but to hang out with. He's a pretty fun guy and I love him a lot. awwwwwe....

And lastly, but probably the most important, I realized that my kids are pretty awesome and they deserve an equally awesome mom.

Right now, that mom is not me. I've finally made "the appointment" (you know, the one to fix the crazy). This is probably an appointment that is YEARS! overdue. I'll admit that I'm scared, excited, and really anxious about it.

And while I detest it when my husband leaves, he has always come back. (Which sometimes, I wouldn't blame him if he ran for the hills and never looked back). This time - he came back with ugly ammounts of Swiss chocolate.
