Nous revenons tout juste du 3e World Trophy en Espagne à Madrid. La compétition avait lieu sur 3 jours soit du 5 au 7 décembre. Notre premier entraînement avait lieu le 2 décembre. Après une journée de voyagement, il n’est jamais facile de retourner dans l’eau. Cependant, notre première pratique a très bien été. Notre horaire était super chargé, nous avions un entraînement avec musique le matin, ensuite un retour à l’hôtel rapide pour dîner, et un autre entraînement dans l’après-midi. Au retour, nous faisions du vidéo afin de corriger le plus d’erreurs possibles pour le lendemain. La compétition a commencé avec l’épreuve de duo libre avec Marie-Pier et Chloé, elles ont très bien nagé! Une heure plus tard, c’était à Tracy et moi de compétitionner dans l’épreuve de duo thématique. Notre maillot avait des pantalons et un chapeau qui représentait la Diva de Salvador Dali. Tous les duos thématiques devaient absolument avoir une thématique espagnole et nous avions aussi droit à un accessoire. Nous passions dernière et nous avons donné notre meilleure performance jusqu’à maintenant. (Cela fait juste 2 mois que nous pratiquons ensemble.) Le lendemain, c’était l’équipe libre. Nous avons dû travailler beaucoup sur nos highlights et vu de cette compétition et ils ont tous fonctionnés! Nous nagions le même programme libre qu’aux Olympiques, mais avec plus de la moitié de nouvelles nageuses. Le dimanche c’était le combo. Le public a adoré notre routine! Nous sommes maintenant en congé pour quelques semaines! En janvier, nous effectuerons quelques changements dans les programmes afin de les préparer le mieux possible pour les Championnats du Monde de 2009, à Rome. After the Olympic Games, half of the team retire, which is totally normal! I'm still swimming and this year, I'm swimming team, combo and duet. The combo is a mix of 5 minutes of everyroutine. It's really visual! It's like a show. We are leaving for our first competition on Sunday. It's the World Trophee in Madrid, Spain. This competition is really different from the World Championships or the Olympics. There will be only 5 judges (there is 10 usually) and their marks will be only artistic. We are going to swim the same free team as at the Olympics, the combo is a brand new routine, the duet free is the same routine as the Olympic and the duet I'm swimming is a thematic duet. Every country has to swim on a spanish music for minutes and we are allow to have an acessory. I'll post some pictures later, I have to keep the secret for now! The duet competition is next Friday, the free team is on Saturday and the Combo is on Sunday. We had an amazing swim!!! We cam 4th!! Japan got a penalty from touching the bottom and we beat US!!!! We are really proud!! Closing today!!! I'm a little early on schedule so I've got a little bit of time to write... After a night of counting and reviewing my routine, we got up ate breakfast and did our hair, make up (which we had a class for Cirque du Soleil) and we put our hat on... The schedule today looks a lot like yesterday... And I might not have time to say how it goes before a day or 2.... But, here is the draw... US goes first, which is really good for us, then 2nd Australia, 3rd Egypt, 4th Canada, 5th China, 6th Japan, 7th Spain and 8th Russia. After our performance, we have a dinner at the Canada house with our friends and families. That's about it for now.... I can't wait to perform...!! And be done... hihi!!! Today was a really good day! Not even we finally tied with the US team, but we also got one of the best performance of our tech team program which was . It contains 11 different elements. We had a little music pratice this morning for 15 minutes and we shared with Japan. The practice went really well! Our coaches almost didn't know what to say after each part of our training! We also did a runthrough to make sure we were ready physically and mentally before we competed. After that, we had a little time to do make up, relax, watch video of our music practice and then we were getting ready for the big event!!! Imagine what goes in your mind while you're sitting there, an hour before you go... You think about thousands corrections that you have, and then you think of how many people are going to watch you on tv, that your family is in the stands for the BIG competition, you also think about how many hours, weeks, years that you work to be able to swim there...! It was almost 3.... then you put your cap and googles back on, and you get ready to do the last warm up before the competition. I did my laps of the routine with the I-pod that goes underwater with a teammate, then got out and walk to the call room. There, we had our focus group, where the captain says what to think about in certain places of the routine, and she told us that whenever we were feeling distracted because it was the Olympics Games, just count louder in your head!! Then, I took a few breath, a sip of water and the doors opened in front of us. It was OUR turn now! So we walked on... as cool as we could be and we did our routine, trying to convince everyone that we ROCK!! The swim felt really good! And the coaches were really happy at the end! We were swimming 3rd and US 8th... (they are our big competitor) So we went to watch them live... and when we saw that we were tied with them we were just so HAPPY!!! We had a few minutes after that to go see our families! So I ran up to them and talked to them for a little while...! That was really cool to have them with me at that moment! We had a short practice for the Free team around 4h30.... We were so excited to go back in the pool and just fight!! So we can be ahead of them and go up in the world ranking. We are now back in the Village and we can't wait to compete tomorrow!! I got up not a long time ago... I'm competing today! Finally, after all that training! It's tech team. I have a thousands things to think about. My hair are up already and half of my make up is done! We are swimming around 3 this afternoon! For the one that wants to watch it live go on ! http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/ Can't wait to swim!!! This morning I had the chance to enjoy our last sleep in before the competition started. I really took the time to rest. My family also had a chance to have special tickets to come and visit the Olympic Village. It was really cool to have them here! At lunch time, I got them Mc Donalds from the cafeteria, while I was eating my little plate of couscous beside them. Oh well, I can't wait t0 treat myself and have some Mcnuggets at the end of my competitions! After they left, we had our daily video session where we focus on what to imprive for the upcoming practice. The spirit was really good and we were really productive. We, then, left all together for the Water Cube to watch the duet final competition. It was really exciting to see the top 12 duets in the World performing back to back and being able to compare them. Right after that, we jumped into our suits for a pratice of an our in the cold pool. It was good the have Marie-Pier (one of the duet girl that also swim in the team) back in the patterns, because she was focusing on duet the 2 days before. We were swimming with only 7 in the patterns. 10 minutes later, we were sitting in special Canada cars to go to the further training pool. The goal today was to do quality on the first time. It took a little while at first, but we got in pretty good by the end. It is now 9 o'clock and we are in a bus going back in the Village, I'm also really looking forward to swim in the competition pool tomorrow and show everyone else what we are made of!!!
