This is purely an opportunity for me to stand up and admit I was wrong. A couple of seasons ago I would watch Arsenal play and spend a good 80 minutes of the game going: 'We need to get rid of Denilson, Eboue and Song they're absolutely awful. Why can't Wenger see that?!' Now I only spend 20 minutes of the game complaining, and that's only when Denilson's on the pitch.

Since Song has been suspended we've looked decidedly dodgy in the middle of the park. Yes of course that also has to do with the absence of Fabregas (and to some degree Ramsey), but Song has grown over the last 2 seasons to become a talented rock of a midfielder and he has finally come into his own. He's taken on the role left by the ridiculous departure of Flamini (who?) and we are a weaker unit without him. Yes he has his shaky moments where you're left asking why he made a forward run leaving a gap at the back, or when he puts the ball out for a Stoke throw when he could have passed it back to Almunia. All in all though my faith has been restored in all things Wenger. He is with the players day in day out on the training field and I am not. Everybody was questioning his re-signing of Sol Campbell. It's now officially the best signing of a quiet January transfer window. Without Sol we probably would have lost at Stoke.
