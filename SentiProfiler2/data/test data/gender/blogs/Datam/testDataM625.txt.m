he most accessible friend and saviour ever, is a genuine pal whose heart is much softer than it looks from outside ! He is a person who never was scared to tell an idiot he is one, or to call a loser a loser...Sometimes he is very very strange to understood and other times, he is just the easiest to read...A King of Kalaai...No one can possibly escape if he starts in full form...avalathaan...! On the whole, he has got every kind of hero hidden in him - sometimes a Bruce Lee, sometimes a Romeo, sometimes a Man of Steel, sometimes an emotional idiot, but in every sense, always ADHIRADEE ! ...and watever happens...jst shreds it off with "I Dont Care"!
A cool buddy to hang out wid...
