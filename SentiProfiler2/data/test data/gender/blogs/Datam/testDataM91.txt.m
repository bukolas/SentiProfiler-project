My first DSN September 1999. It was the first time I was attending a DSN course. Rashmin, Rajesh Jagasia, Harshal and a few of our common friends we all were on it. I think it was the first one in Mumbai. Arunaji from Gujarat was our teacher. The intensity was increasing as each day progressed. I had decided I will be repeating this course at the earliest, to be able to assimilate its intensity.  One of the partcipants took permission to go to his house for a while and come back. We all were surprised at his courage to even ask for a break in DSN course!? He looked very happy after he returned. The course got over and he shared his experience.

"I went home to see if my mother was alright. She had just got discharged from the hospital after a serious illness and nobody was at home. To my surprise she scolded me for taking a break from the course and said, "A man in white robes and long hair and beard came and gave me medicines. I am fine. You focus on your course, come on go asap." " There were tears in his eyes as he narrated this.

The power of the grace is infinite. And the Guru's grace is with us every moment. By the end of the course I too had realised that nothing is impossible. "I am the power!"

Next month I repeated the DSN with BAWA!!! An interesting story about that DSN I can tell you only sitting with you face to face, bcoz its kind of a secret ;-)

Well, 10 years later I conducted a DSN in Delhi - Oct 2009.
