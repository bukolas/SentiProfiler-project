Heads up all my lovelies... I have made a slight change to the setting of my blog - before your comments are posted I will be reviewing them.  In the last couple of weeks I have received some odd, random and illegible comments.  

No offense to anyone, but I don't want links to questionable sites showing up mixed in with all my lovely comments from friends, followers and legitimate visitors.  

I don't mind people expressing their opinions about my writing - I love the dialog... but when those who are obviously phishing for their sites leave bogus comments, I just get plain pissed off.



I spent time with my little art buddies this afternoon - they just have so much fun.  I showed them how to make silhouettes by cutting out this model from a catalog and painting around her.  Then she got passed around and ended up in three journals - they thought it was soooo coooool!!
