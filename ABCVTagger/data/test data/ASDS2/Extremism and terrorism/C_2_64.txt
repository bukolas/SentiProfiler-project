öÓúãö Çááåö ÇáÑøóÍúãäö ÇáÑøóÍöíãöö The Kuffar Occupiers are preparing for Ramadhan The kuffar occupiers are gearing up for the month of Ramadhan. BBC News (UK 04/09/03) reported, ‘Mr Rumsfeld said he would like to see another 10,000 foreign troops in Iraq - … The White House hopes that the Iraqi Governing Council will be fully endorsed by the UN… The council might then issue requests for troops and money - which Islamic nations in particular could respond to while distancing themselves from America and the original decision to go to war. …Under the resolution, US commanders would remain in charge of peacekeeping operations in Iraq…"’ The UK is similarly talking about an additional 5,000 troops. The US general is talking about 10,000 more troops. The Independent newspaper (UK 04/09/03) writes, ‘In the notes, marked "confidential", Mr Straw suggested sending an extra 5,000 UK troops to Iraq to increase security ... He urged "visible improvements" by the beginning of the Muslim festival of Ramadan on October 27.’ In the mean time, the evidence is strengthening, that the American and British governments had gone to war in Iraq for base reasons - for greed and power. After almost 5 months of violent, hateful occupation, there are still no weapons of mass destruction to be found, only the death, and destruction that they rained upon the Muslims in Iraq. The Independent newspaper (UK, 01/09/03) reported, ‘The Government Iraq dossier "did not correspond with reality", the UN's chief weapons inspector said yesterday, casting further doubts on its use to bolster Britain's case for going to war. …Dimitris Perricos, who replaced Hans Blix as the chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq two months ago, dismissed the intelligence as having no foundation in truth.’ The occupiers are not protecting nor caring for the people like they care for the oil refineries and pipelines. They are neither fooling the Iraqi’s nor the Islamic Ummah. There is no doubt, that they are detested and that the Muslims of Iraq do not want them there. The occupation has only compounded the tragedy of the Muslims of Iraq. It is very hard to see, in the recent tragic death of Imam Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, how Saddam would have gained much from such a crime. However it is very easy to see, how the Colonialists and their treacherous US-chosen Iraqi interim Governing Council would have benefited from the removal of an influential, Muslim leader and at the same time sow the seeds of discord between the so called ‘Sunni’ and ‘Shi’a’ factions of Iraq which they so desperately are trying to divide and subjugate. The occupiers know the Iraqi’s hate them. The Islamic World hates them. Even the people of the world see through the charade that is being played on the media in the United States and Britain. Very few forget, that Saddam was a friend of Rumsfeld and at the height of his butchery, a strong ally of the West and being sustained and helped by them to commit his crimes, just as they are sustaining all the other so called rulers in our lands presently. Bush and his brigands are getting desperate and suddenly appear to see the benefit of increased United Nations involvement in Iraq. The blatant hypocrisy is breath taking. The reason is that they fear, the anger of the Muslims will focus and crystallise during this holy month of Ramadhan. Donald Anderson an MP from UK admitted as much on BBC Radio 4 ‘Today’ programme (UK 04/09/03) that they would not be able to adequately deploy the armies from India, Pakistan, Morocco and Turkey in time for Ramadhan. Bush and Blair are seeking to protect their ‘investment’ and shield their occupying forces behind the Muslim armies sent by our treacherous rulers. They seek to manipulate the Believers, like they did in Afghanistan, pitting Muslim against Muslim. Too greedy and too cowardly to do the killing themselves. Western media on the 4th of October reported that Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez claimed that, ‘he had enough soldiers to accomplish the mission given to him by Washington, but its scope did not include guarding Iraq's porous borders or its thousands of miles of highways. Sanchez said last week it was impossible for coalition forces to defend the full length of pipeline that carries Iraq's oil.’ Ramadhan, for the Islamic Ummah is a sacred month of purity, of sublime values, of victory. It is the month of Nusrah of Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala in which He brought down the Holy Qur’an upon mankind. It is the month in which Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala had showered His mercy and granted the Believers many victories, such as those of Bad’r (Ramadhan 2 AH), Fatahul Makkah against the Qur’aish Mushriks (Ramahdan, 8 AH), when Salahudeen defeated the Crusader occupiers of Bilad al-Sham (Palestine), at the Battle of Hitteen (11th of Ramadhan, 1258 CE) Muslims fought and defeated the Tartar Mongol invaders of Baghdad in the battle of Ayn Jalut. Most recently was the flash of victory during Harb ul Ramadhan against the Israeli forces (Ramadhan, 1973 CE). The armies of the Islamic Ummah must not act as guardians and protectors to thieves and terrorist states that invaded our lands. Instead, for the sake of Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala the Creator of the Universe, they should come to liberate the Muslims and their lands and push out the hateful invaders whose only true concern, is to perpetuate the rule of kuffur and consolidate their power over the Believers and to usurp their wealth. Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala says, áøóĞöíäó ÂãóäõæÇ íõŞóÇÊöáõæäó İöí ÓóÈöíáö Çááøóåö æóÇáøóĞöíäó ßóİóÑõæÇ íõŞóÇÊöáõæäó İöí ÓóÈöíáö ÇáØøóÇÛõæÊö İóŞóÇÊöáõæÇ ÃóæúáöíóÇÁó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö Åöäøó ßóíúÏó ÇáÔøóíúØóÇäö ßóÇäó ÖóÚöíİğÇ “Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan.” [TMQ An Nisa’: 76] May Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala give victory to the Believers and liberate us and our lands from the najs of the kuffar and their taghut. May Allah subhanahu wa ta’ala once again, establish Islam upon this earth. Khilafah.com Journal 10 Rajab 1424 Hijri 6 September 2003
