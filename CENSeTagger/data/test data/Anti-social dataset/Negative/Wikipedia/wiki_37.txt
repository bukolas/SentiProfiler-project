Early life

McLean played his underage football with Aberfeldie in the Essendon District Football League and Calder Cannons in the TAC Cup.

He was a graduate of the AIS/AFL academy, and member of the U18 International Rules team in 2003.

McLean was recruited by the Melbourne Football Club, selected in the 2003 AFL National Draft with the club's first round selection (#5 overall) and Melbourne's second selection overall, owing to a pick in the priority round.
AFL career
Melbourne

McLean debuted for Melbourne in 2004, showing instant maturity and decision making ability quickly. He also became one of the most consistent midfielders in the side. A supergoal in the NAB Cup signalled McLean would be a force in the AFL, finishing the season with nine games.

In his second year, McLean finished fourth in the 2005 AFL Rising Star. He finished with 20 games for the year and polled an impressive nine Brownlow Medal votes in just his second year of football.

McLean's 2006 season was interrupted by leg and hamstring injuries, but when playing he had immediate impact and was sorely missed when not available for selection.

McLean started the 2007 season in the worst possible way, sustaining a serious foot injury in round one, playing against St Kilda. The injury kept him out of the majority of the first half of the season. In this period, Melbourne proceeded to lose its first nine games. Once returning to the field, McLean again managed to garner numerous possessions, and act as a guiding light for the Demons, enforcing the idea that he will be the future captain of the club.

McLean injured ligaments in his ankle in a tackle during Melbourne's Round 14 match against Brisbane in 2008. Although McLean returned to the field later in the match, it was later declared that he would require surgery, ending his season.[1] Although McLean finished the season with only 14 games, he ran a close second in Melbourne's best and fairest.
Carlton

At the end of the 2009 season, McLean was traded to the Carlton Football Club in exchange for its first round selection (No. 11 overall) in the 2009 National Draft. He made his debut for Carlton in the first round of 2010, but niggling injuries and knee surgery restricted McLean's playing time for the rest of 2010.[1]

McLean played the majority of the 2011 season for Carlton's VFL-affiliate, the Northern Bullants. He played nineteen games for the Bullants through the season, and won the Laurie Hill Trophy as best and fairest.[2] Despite this good form at VFL-level, he could not gain regular selection for Carlton, playing only four matches for Carlton for the year.
