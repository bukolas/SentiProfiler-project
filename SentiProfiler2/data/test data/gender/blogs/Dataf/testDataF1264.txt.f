This is Sandra ;;I have been doing business with Collection Services, Inc. for more than 30 years and they have delivered top quality service to all my clients.
   All of our contact with CSI is handled in a very professional manner.  One of the things we enjoy most about using CSI as a collection vendor is that we do not receive consumer complaints about their method of collecting.
   CSI is efficient in their collections and they give us outstanding service. We look forward to many more years of using them as a vendor.
   I highly recommend CSI for bad debt collection.
