I think extreme fighting is disgusting, it's horrible. I happen to be a boxing fan, have been all my life. And I know there are issues regarding boxing, and they are serious ones. But this is way beyond boxing. This is people brutalizing each other.'' - New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 1997. The battle for mixed martial arts in our nation's cultural capital has been going strong for more than a decade.  Since Giuliani helped put an end to the contests at the height of the UFC's political battle with Senator John McCain, promoters have dreamed about a triumphant return, a trip to boxing's hallowed stomping grounds.
