You may have seen another of my posts and noticed that I make ethic dishes that take a lot of work.  I'm fascinated by foods that people feel passionate about.  I don't mind taking the time and effort to learn to make them.  I also happen to be shamelessly nerdy!

Last week I made sushi.  I had a large bag of glutinous rice, ingredients for california roll, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and jalapenos.  I sliced and slivered according to the diagrams in my sushi cookbooks and even made two types of spicy mayonnaise for dipping sauce.

Then, I cooked the rice. I followed the package directions.  I timed, I seasoned with spiced vinegar, I cooked, I fanned. I failed.  It was too moist, tasted metallic and stuck to my teeth.  I dumped it in the trash can, muttering to myself.

I tried again, this time steaming the rice longer.  Again with the timer, the vinegar, the fan, and still, no good.  It looked fine, but it was still raw.  I hated dumping it yet again, and I felt a little crazy as I shoveled it into the bin.

I went to You Tube for video support.  I watched four videos, viewing four entirely unique procedures: rice cooker, no cooker, fanning, no fanning.  However, they all washed the rice many times before cooking it, which my instructions had listed as an optional step.  

I started over.  I rinsed the rice eight times, until it no longer yielded the cloud of starch in the wash water.  I left it to drain the recommended 10 minutes, and proceeded as before.  This time I  let the rice boil for a few minutes before turning down the heat for the steaming phase, and I left the rice to steam an extra five minutes to make sure it absorbed all the water.  I seasoned it, and fanned it, and it WORKED!  It tasted good, and had a nice texture, with a pearly shine on the grains.

I wish I could tell you the assembly process was elegant and neat.  I had the rolling technique in my head, but not my hands.  I did manage to get the rolls to hold together firmly, but the fillings were not centered.  Once sliced, they resembled colorful 'googly' eyes on the plate. Sticky rice adorned every surface of the kitchen, my clothing, and my hands, but I had five rolls of handcrafted sushi to show for it.  My feet and back ached, but I was so satisfied.

We ate the crooked sushi like hungry little piggies.  It was tasty, with the rich flavors of the soy sauce, wasabi, and chipotle mayo dipping sauces.  The frustration of the past three hours smoothed away in the fresh and creamy avocado, cucumber, and salmon bliss.
