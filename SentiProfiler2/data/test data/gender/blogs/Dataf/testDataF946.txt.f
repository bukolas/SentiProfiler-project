As it has been college Spring Break here in the Sunshine State Capital (Ha, sunshine state...yeah right!) I have had and abundance of spare time while at work seeing as all the students aren't currently on campus to bother me.. In the branch, there is a TV which scroll's the company's "top news updates" or well...its opinion. BUT, today, something on it got me very excited. Just half-heartedly watching the entertainment new updates, suddenly my eyes were WIDE open, they are now making a movie out of the book i JUST finished reading, Something Borrowed by Emily Giffin. Though it is by no means a literary masterpiece , it is a book that sucks you in from the  her best friend, Darcy, who was the "it-girl" all her life, handed everything she wanted and getting any boy she wants. On Rachel's 3oth birthday, she is still singe (despite her plans to be happily married with children by then) while Darcy is engaged to Dex (a handsome, charming, intelligent man Rachel went to law school with, and introduced Darcy to because she thought she didn't have a shot in hell). After a long night of drinking and partying for her birthday, she finds herself in bed with beginning. It is a story of a tell-tale good girl, Rachel, who has always been a good friend toDex the next morning!! (No worries, I didn't ruin anything, all this info is on the front cover!!) The rest of the novel (or well book, not so sure it deserves the term novel) is the story of the decisions Rachel and Dex must make following their mistake that night. Well not that the synopsis is over, i shall tell you why I was so excited... Ginnifer Goodwin was chosen to play Rachel in the movie-adaption of the book! she is absolutely perfect! She is beautiful, but ofter times over looked, and seems like a wholesome sweet girl! Maybe also because I felt like the character of Rachel is based off of how my life will be when I'm 30, I truly related to her...BUT another exciting part...John Krasinski is playing Dex! Not so sure how he'll pull of the tall dark and handsome thing...he's cute not handsome. but he is a fabulous actor! I will give an update on who the rest of the actors are when I find out! And more updates as the movie progresses! But that was my RAVE for the day!
