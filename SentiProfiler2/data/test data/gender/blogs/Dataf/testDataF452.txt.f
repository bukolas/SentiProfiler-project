Well i don't know what you can say, but eating slowly helps your digestive system work well and digest better and just eat the serving size of what you eat and if after 10-15 minutes you are still hungry then go get more. and as well if you are still growing and in puberty and/or having your period then that can affect it and you could be hungrier and if you don't gain much weight then right now you are prolly just gaining it and it WILL slow down. and if you have a sweet tooth then everybody does, that just means you have to have sweets in moderation.
