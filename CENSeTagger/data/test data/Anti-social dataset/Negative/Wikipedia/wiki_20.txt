Edgar Isaac Lewis Kail (26 November 1900 – 1976) was a former England footballer. He gained three caps in 1929 for England, playing Spain, Belgium and France. He scored two goals on his debut against France. Kail was a committed amateur, turning down moves to professional clubs to stay at his club, Dulwich Hamlet. Kail had a short international career, only six days long, gaining all three caps on England's brief continental tour of 1929. He was the last non-league player to play for the full England team, although not the last amateur - Bernard Joy of Casuals and Arsenal played for England in 1936.

In the 1990s the approach to Dulwich's ground, Champion Hill, was renamed Edgar Kail Way in his honour. In 2003 a blue plaque dedicated to Kail was unveiled by Southwark Council at the site of Champion Hill.
