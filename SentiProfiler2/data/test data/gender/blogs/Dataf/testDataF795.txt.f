I purchased this product a year ago before going on vacation to New York. At that time and currently I don't have a brush roll to protect my brushes. Not sure why I haven't bought one, but I will soon. Any ways I bought this because of many youtuber's doing reviews about it. To be completely honest I never thought that this product wouldn't work it looked like something that was worth buying.
