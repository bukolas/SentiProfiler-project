Now that I'm selling at three stores and involved in three forums I need to expand my Creative Team. For the most part I'll be selling the same kits at all three stores so creating the LO's is not really an issue. What I'm looking for is are few ladies to help spread the word. I have a lot of events going on at all three stores/forums and my own kit releases, contests, promotions as well.
I am looking for someone to help with advertising, enabling, tweeting, giving RAKS, creating beautiful LO's, and leaving love in my forum galleries!

In return you get full access to all three stores...and full use of any CU products! As well as admission to my private CT threads at my forums. And if I have enough volunteers you get to choose the kits you would like to  work with!
If you are interested email me at aducharme@live.com with a link to your most active gallery, blog, a short bio, and a list of any Creative Teams you are on.

BTW newbies welcome!!!

Good Luck...

This call will be open for a few weeks at least and every email will get a response towards the end of the call.... any help spreading the word of my CT call would be very appreciated!!!
Here's a link to each of my stores so you can have a peek at my products... and what your in for!!
