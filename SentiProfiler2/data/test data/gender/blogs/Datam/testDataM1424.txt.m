James Bobin is on board to direct the movie, the plot of which is under wraps. The TV show as well as some of the movies tended to have one key human actor with whom the Muppets associated on their adventures. It is known that Segel plays a man on a quest to find and reunite the Muppets.

The actor's coming aboard is a natural extension of the development process; he wrote the script with pal Nicholas Stoller.

Segel has been on a tear with feature work of late. He recently boarded the Cameron Diaz comedy "Bad Teacher" and last week signed to star with Ed Helms in the Duplass brothers' latest movie, "Jeff Who Lives at Home."
