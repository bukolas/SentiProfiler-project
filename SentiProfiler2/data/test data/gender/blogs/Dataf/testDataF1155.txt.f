According to my psychiatrist SID is a dysfunction disorder under ADD/ADHD. I found a site about it, after researching why I had such sensativity to smell, sound and touch. The sight calls it Sensory Processing Disorder, instead of SID, now. There are different check list pages to see if you or a loved one might meet the criteria. When I did it, I was amazed. I met almost everything. Its very interesting, I wondered, since I take ADD medication if that could actually make the sensory sensitivity worse. I also have PTSD. But after 9 years of being misdiagnosed, I am happy to be functioning pretty well with the ADD medication. As long as I dont let a rebound effect take over, I metabalize the stuff fast, and that even if it is XR. I can also take a Clonazapam to relieve my oversensitivity at those times. For me the ADD medication, while still activly working in my brain, even makes the SID normal. All of the meds and diagnosis are tricky and time consuming, plus alot of trial and error and if lucky a positive!!
