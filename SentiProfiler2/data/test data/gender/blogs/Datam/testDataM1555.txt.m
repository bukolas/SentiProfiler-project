It's really difficult to settle on any one aspect of this episode that I'm the most excited about.  I was serious when I noted two weeks ago that Chuck offers more plot progression and character development than any 5 episodes of Lost, and "Chuck Vs. The Tic-Tac" offered that, and so much more.It takes guts to remove the fangs of any series' most bad-ass character, but all our base are belong to Adam Baldwin for handling the birth of, defection and (figurative) death of John Casey with such believable dramatic weight.
