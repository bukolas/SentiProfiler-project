I must tell you that having a big family assures me of never running out of stories to blog about. This evening Amanda was helping Robin make butter nut squash soup. Apparently you have to cook all the vegetables on the stove top and then while it's still hot puree it in a food processor. As Robin was finished pureeing the delicious smelling soup and transferring it out of the food processor back into the pot, Amanda pulled a chair up to the kitchen counter to see what her mommy was making. As Amanda was watching her mother throw additional spices into the mix Amanda decided that it was her turn………She picked up our cordless telephone and in it went. My telephone that was a beautiful metallic grey was now dripping squash orange. I thought that it was dead. Obviously if the liquid didn't kill it, the heat would have….right? I was amazed, I took a damp towel and dried it off; the darn thing still worked. After about a half hour we received a phone call and Robin picked up. She noticed that it was difficult to hear the person at the other end because squash had gotten into the ear holes. I'll wait until it dries up and I'll use a toothpick to clear it out.
