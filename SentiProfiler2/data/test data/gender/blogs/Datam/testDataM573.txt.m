62 years have paused and many teams have been formed and yet the congress cannot even think of a democratic set up as yet. Performance, if you measure in terms of increase in the growth of BPL families over these period , is no solace either. Neither can you boast of a free and fair society when the terror is lurking on your head at any moment and the economic growth that is being tomtomed is confined only to a few business houses growing richer and richer while the divide between the haves and have-nots is growing wider. Whereas you are questioning the new team of BJP where there is atleast the democracy at its root. Please give them the breathing time and then judge their performance rather than anticipating miracles overnight.
