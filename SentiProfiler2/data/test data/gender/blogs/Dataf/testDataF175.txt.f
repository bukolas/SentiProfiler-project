The Spaniards know how to deal with criminals and terrorists. Every country should consider their methods of arresting these reprobates. Here's one for a laugh. The latest Rap Group - The Wolverines - have come out with "O.T.P." (One Term President. They're young, which is great, and although I am not fond of rap, the song is actually quite catchy. There's even a cameo by Bob Parks from Black and Right. The latest from Zack, over at Diversity Lane, says it all re. the Dems and their herculean efforts to to ram their health care through, come hell or high water. At this point, it's just a question of getting their way, and nothing more. There are many in this world who would be more than willing to wipe Israel off the map. You've got the Palestinians, Ahmadinejad and probably most inhabitants in the Middle East. Then you have the usual Israel bashing, boycotting, liberal types, and the neo-nazi yo-yos who would be just as happy if someone like Ahmadinejad were to accomplish that goal. Palestinians have wiped Israel off the map, figuratively speaking, by literally creating maps sans Israel. And it looks like Target Stores did the same thing, when they manufactured a $1.00 made-in-China miniature globe with Palestine clearly written, but no 'Israel' anywhere to be found. Target denies any ill intent by omitting 'Israel', and did yank them off their shelves, only after many people complained. I'm not sure what Target was thinking when they made that choice, and perhaps they should have abbreviated both countries, or omitted both, but I can't believe they thought they could get away with that.
