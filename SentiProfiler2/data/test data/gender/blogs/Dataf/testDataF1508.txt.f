After college and getting settled in a new job I decided that it was time for a new chapter in life. So I moved into my very own place. Yes 23 and just moving out. I knew this would be a very difficult move because I had never even stayed overnight away from home but maybe 3 times. Boy was I right! So I called in for reinforcements. Jodi and Kristy to save the day. We all needed to get away for our own reasons so this was the perfect time. We would watch Tom Cruise movies and eat popcorn until we got sick. Painting the house was a damn good time considering that none of us was 100% sure of what was going on. Thank God  for family. Who knows what that place would have looked like. After the newest wore off and everybody got into something else, there I was all alone again. I still had family but I needed someone. So I had lost some weight and was feeling pretty good about myself so I called up Jodi and told her we needed to get together. She had been through a divorce recently so she was ready.
