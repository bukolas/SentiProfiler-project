I don't know if it has something to do with all the medicine that I'm on, or the fact asthma causes some degree of stress, or the fact that I'm forced to be "unique" because of asthma, or due to anxiety, or sinus problems, or allergies, or wimpiness or what. But, I sometimes get these terrible headaches, and I have one right now. Actually I have dulled it with an Ultram, but it's still there. I woke up at 2 a.m. with this headache so bad there was no way I was going to go back to sleep, so I got up and took two 500 mg Tylenol. I have to take that much, because one never quite cuts it. I knew this was not a Tylenol headache, though. Yet I had to try it. I had to try something before I took an Ultram. I had to because once I take an Ultram, once it kicks in, I have to write. Doesn't that sound weird. Yep! Ultram relaxes me to the point, puts all these ideas in my head, and I have to put them on paper. I've written some good stuff while on Ultram. Ultram dulls or gets rid of my headaches no matter how bad, it's the first drug I have ever taken that gives me at least some degree of relief. However, even though it is not an opiate, and my doctor says it's safe to use it and work, it gives me the feeling that about three cups of coffee gives me, although without the side effects such as shakiness and such. It just makes me feel euphoric, and happy.
