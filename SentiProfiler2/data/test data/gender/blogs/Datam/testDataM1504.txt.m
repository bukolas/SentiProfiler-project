We get back to the ship and find that Dad is feeling somewhat better, and he joins us for dinner. Our next stop will be Cozumel, and Felix, our waiter, recommended stopping off at Carlos'n Charlie's, the local party bar. He told us that generally, by 3:00 PM or so, the girls start losing their tops, and the party continues on. He told us that the free tequila flows most of the day. Well, that was enough for us! We scatter, and meet again at Dizzy's for a little more jazz, and a final nightcap. Little did we know that the shit was once again going to hit the fan in the morning...
