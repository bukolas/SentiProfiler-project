If you're familiar with my last AER9, you'll recall that the project was completed in only 4 days. I recently had a chance to take another whack at it with a much more lenient deadline, and I'm very, very happy with the results. The basic steps at the beginning were the same as my last build. Make a blueprint, transcribe it to wood, and start cutting, gluing and clamping. I did discover a random and somewhat neat trick for scribing the lines on this though. By printing to vellum on an injket printer, I was able to directly transfer the pattern of the print from the paper to the wood. Using laquer thinner brushed over the ink, I burnished the paper against the MDF and the lines transferred perfectly! Made transcribing my blueprints MUCH easier. The main difference between this build and my last is the materials used. Outside of the stock base, barrel, grip and MF cell, all other parts were made from sintra, styrene, or aluminum. These materials can take detail much better than MDF which afforded me a lot of control in making the shape more accurate. I also decided to use LEDs for a glowing barrel effect. This was a preliminary test-fire to see how the idea would work. In the end, I used the lens out of a laser pointer behind the center hole in the barrel to focus the light and make it brighter in that spot. After the barrel and stock were shaped to the correct dimensions, I started adding details in sintra &amp; styrene. The rounded edges on the back and front parts were made by gluing the sintra into a box and rounding the edges on my table router. Another huge difference in this build was my new lathe. The AER9 has a TON of little rounded bits all over it. These were cut out of MDF or sintra. The microfusion cell is 4 pieces of MDF glued together and shaped on the lathe as well. This rear knob is also lathed MDF. The tube which sits on top of the barrel is an ABS rod. This was a lot easier to shape than the 5/16" steel tube I used on the last build. Here's most of the parts going on for a test fit. The grip is an MDF block with sintra strips shaped over it. To keep a uniform shape, I heat-formed one sheet over the entire grip, then cut it into strips on my bandsaw. The rear of the barrel is a sintra box with styrene accents. The curved part behind the MF cell was sculpted out of apoxie sculpt and sanded to shape. Various other smaller bits were shaped out of sintra/styrene before going to primer. Below is the trigger &amp; trigger arm, MF cell area, barrel, cell eject lever, and other bits. I also scribed the panel lines on the parts with a lino block carving tool I had left over from my art school days. Another test assembly after all the parts had been primed. I had some really tight tolerances when putting it together, as the layers of paint actually made it quite hard to get the front and rear casings over the barrel. Yay precision! To power the LEDs, I used 2 AA batteries housed in an in-line battery holder. The knob on the back of the gun unscrews to reveal the battery door to replace the cells. I was very very happy with how this turned out. The LEDs are switched on and off by a hidden pushbutton switch on the bottom of the rifle barrel. The last lathed part was the bottom support bar. This was carved from a pine dowel and cored out to receive a hollow aluminum bar. Styrene accents finished it off. I also found some knurled nuts to use for the two circular parts on the support bar and JB welded them in place. On to paint! The basecoat silver was done with Krylon chrome paint. After this, I dusted the surface with a darker silver by holding the can about 2 feet away from the part and spraying lightly over the entire surface. This gave the paint a stippled texture like cast aluminum would have (this is shown a little better on the front barrel casing in the shot below with the barrel painted green.) Color was done with Testors spray paint for the barrel (which is annoyingly thin and loves to run) and Testors brush paint for the silver on the MF cell and upper pipe. After this, each individual part got a coat of clear to protect the finish. I know I'm going to get a ton of decal questions, so I hope this answers them preemptively. It seems like custom decals are the bane of every replica maker, and it took me a bit to figure out the best way to do it as well. As with my Portal Gun, the AER9 got water-slide decals on the MF cell for the warning messages, arrows, and stripe. These were designed in Adobe Photoshop and printed onto water-slide decal paper on a laserjet printer. The barrel decals were done differently. The barrel was scanned on a computer scanner to pick up the color &amp; texture of the paint. Then, I designed the side decals in Illustrator, taking them into Photoshop to layer them over the green background and weather them a bit before printing. These were output on adhesive-backed vinyl using a plotter, then applied to the gun. There is a slight seam line around the sides of these, but its only evident under close inspection. Here's the gun all assembled and shiny brand-new! So pretty, so clean... So needs a few coats of grime. This was the first pass. Another new tool I had for this build was an airbrush. I'd never used one before, so this was as much a practice run as it was a weathering effort. It took some getting used to, but I was very satisfied with the results. NOTE: If you don't seal inkjet decals before acrylic paint weathering, they will run &amp; bleed! This is why I clearcoated the gun before this process. I also made a display board for the gun to sit on, in maple. This was stained satin black. Here's the final shots of the gun after all the weathering was completed and given another coat of clear to protect the finish. I am very glad I got to revisit this piece, but I don't think I'll be making another one. 2 was plenty for me, and its time to try another project with my newfound techniques and materials. These pics and more build images are all available on my flickr page , in much higher resolutions. Thanks for reading! New year, new projects, new deadlines. And, if I'm honest, some old deadlines from last year too. Here's a few of the projects that I've got on various burners that will be featured in the coming months: AER9 Laser Rifle ( Fallout 3 ) Thats right, I'm doing this again. The last one was a very rushed build and I would have loved to have more time to get the details to my liking. On this project, I can! I learned a lot from the first AER9 and all of that trial-by-fire will be applied to this project. Things are moving fast, so I may have a finished product very soon. Among the improvements are a moving trigger, screenprinted labels, and an illuminated barrel! Force-a-Nature ( Team Fortress 2 ) This project is also moving quickly, though I wish I'd taken more pictures of the process. The proportions of this gun are ridiculous - the barrels hold a 4 gauge round and are only 7.25" long! This will be a heavy and robust piece when completed. I have a neat collaboration going on with a fellow who is maching some aluminum parts for it too, can't wait to show those off! Chell's Heelsprings ( Portal ) These poor things have been sitting in 90% limbo for a while now, awaiting a few minor bits to make them perfect. We have a Portal photoshoot coming up in the near future, so hopefully they will be back on the table soon. Link's Hylian Shield ( Zelda: Twilight Princess ) My first shield was also my first real "prop". When I first took a crack at this, the entire shape was eyeballed and I didn't know my materials very well. On top of that, I didn't take any progress photos! This shield will rectify a lot of the issues of the old one, mostly the major inaccuracies and cumbersome weight of my first project. All this, and more, in 2010. Thanks for reading! We did it! After two months of back-and-forth with the PR reps at the Georgia Aquarium, we were allowed to bring Big Daddy in for a photoshoot! This was a colossal effort, and just like the original display of the piece, several hands went into making it happen. Much thanks to my friend Kim and Jay for getting up at 5am to come with us and be our handlers, to the Georgia Aquarium staff for this amazing opportunity, and to Matt Nicholson (and his fiancée!) of Dim Horizon Studio for doing such fantastic photography and editing. Big Daddy is currently for sale ! Check this eBay listing , which ends on 12/03/09 - just in time for the holidays! Nothing says "I love you" quite like a hulking murder machine. I hope you guys enjoy these photos as much as I have been. Edit: 11.24.09 - Select wallpaper sized files now available for download!

They do offer private photoshoots for individuals and businesses, and they take place before business hours so you can have a crowd-free session. Our photoshoot took place between 8 and 10am, so we didn't disturb the normal flow of customer traffic. If you want to contact the Georgia Aquarium about doing a private photoshoot of your own, check out this form . There were divers cleaning the insides of the tanks when we first arrived, and as we began our shoot, some of them started to crowd around and look at what was taking place. Definitely an odd experience when you're the one being looked at from the inside of the fish tank. Its easy to see the biggest change in the suit: LEDs! I added light diffusion panels to the dome of the Big Daddy for this shoot, and I'm very glad I did. I also added foam padding around the shoulders, hips, and knees in order to fill out the suit a bit more and prevent that stick-like effect that showed up in some of the photography from DragonCon. As with before, I owe all the sewing credit to my fiancée, Emily. She's also the creepy-as-hell Little Sister in these shots.

I have been getting a TON of requests/inquiries about the Daft Punk helmet. Most of these emails have very similar questions, so I figured I'd make a quick Q&amp;A post that I can reference which will hopefully answer everyone at once. If you don't want to read all the copy below, I don't blame you. I do tend to ramble. Summary: Currently I cannot recreate these with a zero margin of error. I have gone through several casts in order to get one with a perfect finish to send along to my client. I do not believe in selling my work to someone unless it is flawless, and as of now there are still issues with this process. Due to this, I cannot take any orders for replicas of finished helmets. Q : Is the helmet for sale? A : No, this helmet was built for a client of mine and was constructed specifically for him. Unless he wants to sell it (not likely!) it is not available for purchase. Q : Will you make me a helmet/are there other replicas you're willing to sell? A : There are 2 parts to this answer. Firstly, I am currently booked until April, and cannot take any commissions in May or June due to my wedding and honeymoon. Any work I do is purely first-come, first-served, and I am not taking commission reservations at this time. When I open up again to take reservations for 2010, I will post on here. Projects will very likely fill up quickly, so look out for updates in December/January! Secondly, there are not currently any copies available for sale, and I cannot definitively say there ever will be. At this time, there are still issues with chroming the plastic helmets. Also, I don't have a continued source for visor vacuum-forming. I do not own my own vac-forming machine, and BlindSquirrel did the first run as a favor to me. He has plenty of his own work to see to and I do not want to impose on him to continue these for me. The short answer is this: I am only making 2 finished helmets. One for me, and one for my client. That is all there will be until April. If someone is interested in another one, be sure to check back on my blog in December/January for when I will be taking reservations again . Q : Will you make/Have you made Thomas' helmet? A : I have not, but plans are in the works. This build will start in mid 2010. Again, like above, please note that the initial helmet will be made for my client ONLY. Any other requests will follow my standard commission queue. Q : How much will a finished helmet cost with the LED effects? A : During the course of this project, it has become remarkably apparent to me as to why the real helmets fetch a $64,000 price. This stuff is intricate, finicky, and expensive. I do not disclose client final pricing on projects, but I can say that certain things carried a hefty price tag. Custom PCBs for the lighting run about $250/helmet, the LEDs themselves cost $150/helmet, and the electrical components (Arduino board, transistors, resistors, plugs, wires, etc etc etc) totaled over $300. That alone is $700, and thats just materials cost for blinking lights! I hope that gives some idea of the scope of the rest of the project. Q : Can I buy a raw cast from the mold to make a helmet on my own? A : EDIT: I AM TAKING A BREAK FROM OFFERING RESIN HELMETS. The mold has started to show some wear after making 25 copies, and I also need time to finish other projects. Resin copies are now on hold, indefinitely. Q : Can I have your schematics/plans/illustrations/research notes? A : On some scale, yes. My schematics are included in my client's budget; this is the case with all of my builds. Their payments cover the time in research and drawing of these plans. If you like, I can provide you with hi-res .eps, .pdf, or .ai files to help you in your build for a small fee. Keep in mind that typically these blueprints are the result of several hours of research and planning, then even more time drawing. I hope that answers some of the questions I've been getting about the helmet, and I truly am appreciative of all the attention its been getting. If I had the ability to make one for every person who has asked, I would! However, I am only one guy, working in his spare time at home. I can't possibly take orders for dozens of replicas, and I'm just plain uneasy about booking out time way too far in advance. To everyone who has asked me about these replicas: Thank You for your interest and your support of my work! Again, I really wish I could help out all the people who have sent me inquiries, but one guy can only do so much. Finally, because I hate posts without pictures, here's a few images to tide everyone over until I can send out some finished shots of the helmet in all its blinking glory: And one teaser video... I'll explain all of these in the next entry of the Daft Punk helmet saga; Part 3: Electronics ! EDIT: For information regarding replicas of this prop, please see THIS POST In the last post I had about this build, I ended with the finished master, ready for molding: Silicone, silicone, silicone. Layered in stages, with registration keys and marks for the mother mold. The mother mold was made with Plasti-paste. In retrospect, this makes for a very heavy mold that gives you some sore shoulders after slushcasting, and fiberglass may have been a better idea. At least its sturdy! The detail captured in the silicone was perfect! Some resin pulls. I started off with smoothcast 320, but it proved difficult to make a nice, thin pull. After switching to smoothcast 300, things got a bit more to my liking. Couldn't help walking around in one. I trimmed out a casting of the visor to make the vacuum-former mold for the visors. This was mounted to a flat board so PETG plastic could be pulled over it. Ear areas were trimmed out for the LEDs and black plate that sits in the cones. The trimmed and sanded helmets were given a coat of primer and wet sanded to take out any minor imperfections in the resin surface. I need to take a minute aside here to go on a personal rant, and I apologize in advance for that because the last thing I want my blog to become is my own personal
soapbox. This project is a large and complex one, and due to that there were certain things I had to farm out to other vendors and craftsmen. Specifically, the chrome gold plating of the resin and the vacuum-forming of the visors. I don't possess the tooling to do either of these, so I had to look elsewhere. Metalizing: Initially, I had planned on going to M&amp;M Metalizing for my gold chrome work. Over the phone estimates placed the process at $125 per helmet. I agreed, and sent two of the ones you see above (wetsanded and prepped) for finishing. The day after sending the package and an email confirming they were en route with tracking number, I received a phonecall from M&amp;M. The price had risen to $175 per helmet, without much in the way of explanation. I was in a bind an under a deadline, and I agreed. The day the package was arrived, I got another call saying that gold plating carried an additional $25 surcharge per part. This increased my original price of $250 for 2 helmets to now $400, plus return shipping. Angry, I requested they be shipped to another company for plating. M&amp;M then charged me (COD with no invoice) $100 for 2-day return shipping. Next-day air had cost me $46 less than a week before. This is the condition the helmets arrived in at the other shop: You can see the damage to certain areas noted by the arrows ( larger version here ) The helmets were not packaged in the box; merely thrown on top of the wrapping I had sent previously (they had been sent out by me wrapped very carefully in foam and bubble wrap to prevent the above from happening.) Additionally, the helmets themselves were greasy with fingerprints and other oils, which would have caused major imperfections in the finish. I offer this story as an caution – and hopefully warnings like this will come infrequently – to anyone who reads these posts of mine looking for similar processes. As someone who relies very heavily on reputation in order to have a continued supply of business, I don't see how anyone can operate in this manner. My contact there was generally abrasive on the phone, and obviously cared very little for my continued patronage. Vacuum-forming: Mike (BlindSquirrel), a fellow prop builder over at My Dumb Projects , took care of the vac-forming for me. Mike is a fantastic guy, an amazing craftsman, and his work on this project well exceeded my expectations. Actually, his patience was the best part, as my mold proved to be a frustrating piece of kit to work with (mostly because I didn't know how to build a proper vacuum-former mold) Eventually he worked out the kinks, with stellar results: The visor was tinted on the inside with car tail-light paint, called "VHT Nightshades" The result is a nearly opaque outer appearance, but only a tinting similar to dark sunglasses from the inside. This visor, like the rest of the helmet in this post, is a test piece. You'll notice some webbing in the PET plastic in the images. No sense testing the tint on a shiny, perfect piece! The back wire "hair" is a test piece for now, built with pieces I have laying about from other various projects. The actual plastic dome is built from the excess resin used trimmed out of the visor area. Currently the colors are incorrect, but this is just a "proof of theory" piece. New Chrome! The gold plating done in these shots was completed by " E7 Technologies " and is a process called Cosmichrome. While we're still getting some small issues worked out, this is a very cool technique. The people at E7 are everything that M&amp;M are not. They have helped me and been very accommodating through the entire process, and have been willing to run test pieces for me in order to achieve the best result. The images below are a shot of the "dud" helmet, which had too much orangepeel and issues with the finish to be called a success. Neat video of the chroming process: Part three should be the final chapter in this build, with everything coming together. Look for it around Halloween! Still to come.... EDIT: I'm currently working on a bit of a redesign here. Apologies of the site looks like crap for a little while. A commission came to me very, very last minute for a good friend of mine. He was planning on doing a Vault Dweller costume from Fallout 3, and needed a weapon in a month. Unfortunately I had other commissions, deadlines, and large projects to finish in that span of time. I looked at my schedule, decided I could shave off some sleep, and promised him 30 hours of build time. What follows is the result of that hurried errand. First, as always, I put together some blueprints. These are fairly low-detail, but work well for the scope of what I'm doing with this build. After this build was about 80% finished, I was pointed in the direction of currently-existing and much better and more accurate blueprints, but thats a story for when I take on this project again in the future and give it the proper time it deserves. In order to save time, my friend came over and traced my blueprints onto MDF. I taught him how to use a bandsaw (nothing like a crash course in something that can leave you fingerless!) and he went to town rough-cutting the shapes I'd refine later into the gun. Here's where we started: Impressive, right? I had a sick idea of just scotch-taping all these together, painting the whole thing silver, and handing it to him the day of the convention... but I'm not that mean. Ignore the lighter pieces near the bottom - those are part of another build. After cleaning up the cuts on a belt sander, I began the assembly of the main body in the 2 most prominent parts - the square "barrel" and the rear stock. These are both made from 1/2" MDF. The barrel has a few sections cut out for the microfusion cell... ...and a space for the rear stock and lower receiver to mount I used a table router to re-shape the holes in the stock and bevel the edges. This was also a low-budget build, so I didn't have the liberty of going out and buying fancy new holesaws. The lower support rod was made out of varying sized of pine dowel, threaded over a 1/4" aluminum bar. The front grip was made from 2 pieces of 3/4" MDF, screwed together and shaped on a belt sander. Styrene will eventually make up the grip texture. The microfusion cell was pieced together from some pre-existing elements. I had a small dome mold that I'm using on another project that happened to be pretty close. I pulled two of these and epoxied them around some 2" PVC pipe. MDF discs were affixed to the main body to make the housing around the cell. At this point, it started to resemble the final product! This is about 6 hours into the build ( Yes, I'm using "build" as a noun! Colloquial English; take that grammar sticklers! ) Styrene was added to the lower grip, as well as the cell eject lever and front barrel area for the raised textures The upper barrel pipe was made out of 3/8" steel pipe. This terminates into a lathed pine dowel glued to the barrel corner If you're wondering why some of these shots are so dark, recall that the "extra time" I found to build this came when I should have been sleeping. The bulk of this project was done between 10pm and 1am on most days... After a coat of primer and some sanding, I started scribing panel lines with a dremel tool, and adding screw recesses around the front of the barrel. Other details were added in MDF around the cell loading chamber, and the rear part of this area was faired down into the barrel of the gun with apoxie sculpt. I also added the raised pucks on the grip and stock. Recessed areas were drilled into the gun and filled with countersunk phillips screws More styrene and MDF pieces were added to the barrel and rear area of the gun to build up the details in these areas. The shapes of these were largely improvised, as by this point I only had 4 days left until my deadline with many other projects that needed completing. After this, the whole gun received a coat of gray primer to seal the remaining exposed wood. The first coat of paint went on shortly after the above finished drying. I used Krylon hammered silver, followed by a coat of Testor's Olive Drab on the main barrel. Fortunately for me, these guns are supposed to be 200+ years old in the Fallout 3 universe. That means its time for my favorite thing of all... heavy weathering! The basecoat of weathering was done with acrylic paints and matte gel medium. I did an initial coat of black, followed by browns and greens to simulate dirt and corrosion. After this dried, I gave the whole piece drybrush silver accents to simulate wear and tear from the wastelands. chipping away at the paint and caked-on dirt. The finished piece has a nice shimmer to the metallic silver drybrush, which simulates metal rather well. Finally, some more shots of the finished product from a few different angles. I'm still looking for a good way to transfer my vector decals to the gun. I tried water-slide as with my Portal gun build, but yellow ink on top of dark green showed up very poorly. There are a lot of details missing from the final product, so I want to return to this prop someday and build it without such an insane time restriction! I really wish I could have given this project a bit more time and been more dedicated to the intricate detail this gun has, but for a 4 day build this turned out better than I could have hoped. Happy Super Mutant Hunting! Wait. ...you know... I had this whole thing written out, and then I went to preview the blog entry, and something just didn't look right. The rifle was weathered, but it still looked too clean on that white background. The graphics of the Fallout games do a good job of making the weapons look blackened, but I felt like this needed a bit more. I went back after thinking about it, and decided to add some rust to the AER9. The shots above is how the gun was delivered and shown at the convention. Here's how it sits now: And, just for the hell of it, a modified version of one shot in the "Fallout 3" graphic style: (Higher res pic HERE , and more high-res shots of the build process available on my flickr page ) Ok, NOW we're done! I finally lost my mind enough to try to tackle one of these big guys. For those unfamiliar, Big Daddys are the protectors of the Little Sisters in Rapture, an underwater city devoid of morality which has degenerated into chaos and insanity. They are huge, fast, strong, and as it turns out, a solid pain in the ass to build. I'm going to break with tradition for a sec, and show you the finished product first. This is a long, long, long post that details nearly 7 solid weeks of work, and you guys deserve to know that the long post is quite necessary, and (I think) well worth the read. Credit goes to " scenemissingmagazine " on Flickr for this amazing photograph: (High-rez shot here) So, here's how I did it. First thing's first, I needed blueprints. I built these in Illustrator, based off some very good reference images that the guys at 2K published in their artbooks: Since this is such a large project, I'll break down the build process into partitions: The main body, the dome, the drill arm, the dome cage, other details, and the final paintwork. The Main Body Starting with the blueprints printed at full scale (HUGE) I made cross sections out of insulation foam and glued them into place. The empty areas between sections were filled with cardboard. This formed what I called the "skeleton" of the body. The empty cavities in the skeleton were then filled in with expanding foam After drying, the foam was carved into the shape of the main body After this was completed (and the foam given more drying time so it would retain its shape) the entire form was covered in stretch fabric. This smoothed out a lot of the lumpiness of the foam Accent areas around the arms, legs, and top of the body were made out of insulation foam, then glued to the body. Before coating with paint or fiberglass resin, these were covered with Ureshell to prevent the poly foam from dissolving. Certain areas on the body itself were also given a coat of Ureshell so they would not disintegrate. After this was dry, the entire body piece was given several applications of fiberglass resin. The front flap was added using more insulation foam, and also given a coat of Ureshell and resin. After this was dry, I began hollowing out the foam and cardboard. After adding some details on the body with foam tape, more ureshell, and more resin, I had a finished form! The Dome I started with a 24" smoked security camera dome off of eBay. This came from a demolished shopping center, and are actually hard to track down these days, given the much smaller size of most security cameras. I remember these all over the place as a kid. I was sent two of them for some reason, so if anyone wants the second one, just let me know. After trimming the square edge off, I cut a disc from insulation foam to serve as the "ring" around the dome. I made resin copies of wingnuts which were glued into place on the trim ring. About 15 of these resin duplicates weighed as much as a single wingnut. Since I had to wear this thing, every ounce saved counted! For the portholes, I made a single master out of PVC and MDF wood... ...which I molded in silicone. The portholes were all slush-cast to save weight and time in production. Also, this way, they're completely identical. The tape here is marking the spacing of the portholes After coating the dome in resin to thicken it a bit, I trimmed the porthole-holes with a dremel. The dome was a very brittle acrylic, so this was a nerve-wracking process! The drill arm Unfortunately, since this project was done in such a hurry, my process photography was somewhat lacking. The drill started out as an aluminum rod with 4 triangles of matteboard affixed to it. Rings of foam were made around the matteboard, then paper layered on top of that to create the cone shape. The actual "blade" of the drill bit is made from masking tape which has been layered in small sections to follow the curve of the drill sides. This piece was coated in several layers of fiberglass resin (some with tinting to check coverage) To create a really worn look, I added bits of debris to the fiberglass resin. This made a convincing textured metal finish in the end, as these parts were painted to look like rust, dents, and bits of splicer. A PVC cage and old DeWalt 12V cordless drill make up the support frame and motor for the drill. I moved the battery inside the body of the suit to save on weight hanging from my arms. The "housing" for this mechanism was made from a concrete tube, electrical conduit PVC and more foam tape. This was painted in ureshell to protect it during painting as well as to give it texture. The Dome Cage This was constructed mainly out of PVC electrical conduit. This pipe is gray in color and takes heat and bending much better than standard white PVC tubing. I bought 40 feet of it for this project and ended up using about 35. At only ¢88/10 feet though, this was an easy buy. The sides terminate into 3" PVC couplers. These slide over 3" PVC pipe anchored to the body that has been notched to be a sightly smaller diameter than 3". Since the wearer has to enter through the front porthole, the dome as well as the cage must be removable. The front of the cage is friction-fit at the top and bottom anchorpoints, as well as the sides, so it can easily be put on and taken off. A quick test of the body, dome, and cage. This is after the dome has had all portholes carved out and secured. Other Details An animatronic hand and arm extension were created for the left side of the suit. This would help prevent the "stubby arm" look I've seen on other Big Daddy suit builds The rear tank was made from a 12" concrete tube with foam plugs on the top and bottom carved to a dome shape. The bands around the tank were made with foam tape coated in Ureshell. I made a pushmold of some bolt heads for texture, these were cast in resin and added to the tank as well as the banding on the main body. Boltheads and a first coat of paint on the tank. The wheel at the top is a cake decoration from our local supermarket. The boots were made from more insulation foam. These give me about 6" of lift and make the feet look proportional to the rest of Big Daddy. I got this i
