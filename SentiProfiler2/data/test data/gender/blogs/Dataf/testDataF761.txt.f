Gladiator, along with Braveheart, Terminator, and Scarface, holds a high place in the "We're Manly Men" hall of fame. But it's not just gory battles and rippling muscles (although it has these things in spades). The plot is surprisingly emotional, telling the story of a family man trapped in a world where he excels, but wishes that he could just return home to his family. When his family is brutally murdered, he is forced into slavery as a gladiator, his only future the amusement of the blood-thirsty mobs of Rome.
