I like the feel of a thin razor going across my skin, not very deep, just enough to feel it and see the blood surface. I have this urge daily, usually when im bored or frustrated and misunderstood about something stupid. At least once a week or more I find a spot of poison oak on my hand and/or arms and I prefer to let it swell up enough so I can scratch it hard enough to break the skin good. Then I like to burn them closed with cigarettes. A nice swift whack across my shins with a good ol stick of wood works pretty good. I bite my fingernails off to the point my fingers bleed, and when there isnt enough left to chew on Ill go to chewing my on my fingers and cuticals. I often use my razor to cut my cuticals and callases off. I dig around in my hand with my razor often looking for thorns that arent there anyways, but just like exploring I guess. I pick my scabs constantly and make em bleed more.
I don't really have the urge to self unjure I just do it and enjoy it, it calms me. It helps slow down my thoughts, the thoughts of death, homicide, etc. Its not that I want to commit suicide or harm someone else but I get thoughts of it all the time just out of the blue about random situations. They are strong enough that I get myself confused as to where I dont know if its a real situation or not.
I have my off days where for no reason I want to die and visualize it happening and what it would feel like, I wonder who would it impact and who would care or miss me. I often have daydreams of someone close to me dieing and wonder how I would react to it but I dont know and cant feel any emotion about it. Im lost and dont know what way to go. I had it all not to long ago and now nothing but friends and wouldnt trade em for all the money in the world. They are the ones that get me through most days.
When someone doesnt return a call, respond to a text, or do what they say their gonna do I slowly start into that rage and have very evil thoughts of harming them but turn it on to myself instead.
UPDATE, May 22 2011,
I was doped up ready for bed and in a daze last night when I wrote this. Its all true except for where I tend to contradict what I say. After what Ive said on this page, YES, I do have the urge to self harm. The other thoughts of hurting others are usually arguments I start with people I dont know inside my head, Daydreaming maybe, and it gets pretty severe at times to the point to where I cant be around others because Ill get paranoid.
