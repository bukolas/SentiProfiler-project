This iron hardly got hot enough to flatten anything. Very little heat production, maybe faulty item, but warranty service was poor. My hair is quite curly and so needs straighening every day. The sedu does straighten reasonable well but it takes quite a lot of time and also the machine has a design fault (or so it seems) as it is extremely easy to trap your fingers in it while using it. I was impressed by the sound of the product having tourmaline plates which are meant to help prevent split ends.I like it very much! i like the 1" better than the wider 1 1/2" because i have bangs (that absolutly MUST be staightened) but it still works GREAT on my long hair. and it makes it sooo soft. and well that just makes me smile.so just buy it already. really you will be so glad you made the choice. I used to straighten my hair in the salon and it takes me too much time. Then my friend suggest me to try it myself with a hair straightener. And she recommended SEDU. I really didn't want to spend as much as this hair straightener costs, but after reviews, and needing one that didn't rip my coarse & curly hair to shreds, I relented. Well it is a wonderful tool. It heats up extremely quickly and my hair is shiny, & silky smooth. I'm also applying Biosilk Silk Therapy to my hair prior to flatironing. Thanks to both the flatiron and the Silk Therapy, the formerly very tough job of hair straightening is now far easier for me. Thanks very much!
