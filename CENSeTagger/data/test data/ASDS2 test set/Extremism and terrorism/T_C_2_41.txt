This whole thread seems as inane as stating "My superiority complex is greater than your superiority complex." no, that is not the purpose of this thread daily, by the minute, we, as muslims hear about how bloodthirsty islam is, how the mujahideen kill innocents, the taliban are evil, every muslim who struggles against oppression is evil and a cause of the death and mayhem in the world this is not true but it is reported as true and it is the perception many have, including muslims this thread is an attempt to straighten out that misconception
