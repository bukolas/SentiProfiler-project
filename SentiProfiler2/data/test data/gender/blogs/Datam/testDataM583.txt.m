I guess I am little late in wishing you all a Happy Pongal but yet the festival season isn’t over yet. So I wish you all a Happy Pongal and a Happy Tamil New Year as well! I guess I am late in posting the first post this year too. It is pretty surprising that I am into my fifth year of my blogging. The journey continues. As far as my blogging goes, it goes pretty slowly at the moment. But it seems just like last month, I stepped into SSN College of Engineering. Now I am just a part of the SSN alumni. Last week, they had conducted a wonderful tribute to the SSN alumni and I really appreciate that, even though missing it by thousands of miles. Every year, we look into the rest with a new hope, trying to build a future that has been carved perfectly in our minds. We try to recreate that model. Sometimes we fail but sometimes we win. Some people drive with the hope of winning. Some drive with the fear of losing. The former is preferred as when driving a car, you go with the intention to go to the destination safely and you don’t drive with the fear of crashing. Again ‘Safety’ is a weird word and I need to use it carefully. ‘Safety’ is closely associated with fear and it is contradicting my opinion. The positive hope is what drives us forward but at the same time, we need to have a small touch of fear that helps us defend ourselves to whatever obstacles we are facing on the journey ahead.
