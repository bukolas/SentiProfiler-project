Sometimes we  wonder, 'What did I do to deserve this?' or 'Why did God have to do this  to me?' Here is a wonderful explanation! A daughter is telling her Mother  how everything is  going wrong, she's failing algebra, her boyfriend broke up with her and  her best friend is moving away. 
Meanwhile, her Mother is baking a  cake and asks her daughter if she would like a snack, and the daughter  says, 'Absolutely Mom, I love your cake.' 
'Here, have some  cooking oil,' her Mother offers. 
'Yuck' says her  daughter. 
'How about a couple raw eggs?' 'Gross,  Mom!' 
'Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking  soda?' 
'Mom, those are all yucky!' 
To which the mother  replies: 'Yes , all those things seem bad all by themselves.. But when  they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully delicious  cake! ' 
God works the same way. Many times we wonder why He would  let us go through such bad and difficult times. But God knows that when He  puts these things all in His order, they always work for good! We just  have to trust Him and, eventually, they will all make something  wonderful! 
God is crazy about you. He sends you flowers every  spring and a sunrise every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He'll  listen. He can live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your  heart.
