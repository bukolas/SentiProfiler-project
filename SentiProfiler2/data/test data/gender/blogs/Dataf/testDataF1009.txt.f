I realized that the best time to start potty training is when the kid is around 5 months old. When the head doesn't need support and the neck is firm. At that age, they don't run around and it is easier to put them on the potty. You will be able to identify when they want to "go" so you start putting them on the small potty. For my son that's what my mom did - that habit continued and he kind of started knowing that "If I am put on the potty I must sort-of push ". Now my son is a year old and quite recently I started the habit of taking him to the bathroom and putting him on the regular potty. So now he knows to say "baa" (bathroom) when we wants to "go".
I see that some parents (new of course!) are finding it difficult to potty train kids after they reach the walking age. Kids just get used to the diaper and refuse to sit in one place. Of course, this doesn't come with the side effects of other "settais" (I think vaguley translates to naughty behavior) -These days he loves to go to the bathroom and play with the water. So he will make that "I have to go" face . I tried putting him on the smaller potty - he sat there for 2 seconds and started pointing to the door and he says "baa". I took him to the bathroom and he immediately ran to the bucket to play with the water! So I am as usual running behind him!
