So far, like this year's basketball tournament, we've had our share of upsets.  For those of you who don't follow basketball, although the upsets are usually the BEST PART of the tournament, the first round of both March Madness and Fug Madness are designed so that the number one seeds (in basketball, these are the best teams; at GFY, it's most fugly celebs) have an easy couple of games and don't meet their biggest competition until later on, with the hope that the FINAL game will pit the two very best (fugliest) in one final head-to-head. That's why someone like Mischa gets someone like Camilla Belle in her first game. It's almost like a gimme for the one seed...but sometimes, the underdog comes from behind and when that happens, it's AWESOME.  What will today bring? We'll soon find out. But until then, a brief teaser for the Fug Match-Ups you'll see on Monday: Well, this ought to be interesting: the wackily-attired socialite versus the barely-attired "actress." Place your bets now, but I think this one could go down to the wire. In the first round, Fab blew through Carrie Underwood like she was the favorite and not Carrie -- we like that kind of confidence from a bizarrely-garbed random -- and Pammy spanked Drew Barrymore, despite the fact that Drew looked like a lunatic most of next year, what with the heinous leggings and the two-tone hair. What happens when two spoilers go up against each other? We're about to find out. I'm super excited to see how this one shakes out. Both ladies handily dispatched their round one opponents -- Rumer Willis and Nicole Kidman, respectively. Both are musicians prone to wearing SUPER CRAZY costumes and neither has ever met a headdress she didn't immediately put on and wear out. Could Juliette take down Katy? Stranger things have happened.
