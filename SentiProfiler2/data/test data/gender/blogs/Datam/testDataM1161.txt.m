Another marriage ruined by the gays

Clearly gays getting married in other states has ruined Charlie's marriage to the point that he is not even interested in spending his anniversary with his wife. This is why marriage equality must be stopped.

The Broward Palm Beach News has been checking in on political lovebirds Charlie Crist and Carole Rome:

A Crist-Miss Story: Florida's First Couple Celebrates First Anniversary... Separately:
Crist still followed through with the marriage, of course, but in the year since, the pair have rarely been seen together. Most recently, Crist spent the evening of their first anniversary in Palm Beach's Mar-a-Lago at a March of Dimes fundraiser, with wife Carole nowhere in sight, according to page2live.com.

This after a year in which Rome bounced between visits to her kids in New York and her home on Fisher Island, while Crist stayed in Tallahassee or his home in Tampa Bay. Remember, Crist worked right through the couple's honeymoon.

But come on! The first anniversary? You two aren't even trying anymore. And why should you? If Crist is gay -- or if he's just a commitment-phobic straight guy who likens Burger King funnel cake sticks to a 'beignet' -- he shouldn't feel political pressure to get married.

Twenty years

I was there. From Outweek, December 24, 1989:

The Women

Whether it's Suzanne Craig, Silda Spitzer or Darlene Ensign, it surprises me that the women married to these men stand behind them. I am no expert in heterosexual marriage, but I imagine the pain finding out your husband likes to have sex in bathroom stalls with men in train stations and airports ranks up there with experiencing divorce.

As the late Rodger McFarlane said says in Outrage: "I know what they have to say in public and I actually kind of admire them for being able to give that performance, I'm sure I couldn't. But, that's some wierd shit."

Jenny Sanford wouldn't take the role.

The wife of embattled South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) announced Friday morning she is filing for divorce, saying in a statement that she decided to dissolve her marriage after 'many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation.'
