It's a while since my last post and that's partly because I didn't have a great deal to say and partly because I was busy trying to get my life in order. I now feel as though I'm making some progress. I mentioned previously that I had been medically retired from my job and, at the age of 53, that wasn't really in my plans. Aside from anything else, I've always been a very busy person and I felt as though my days didn't have much of a purpose. I had lunch with my former work colleagues last week and that was my 'leaving do'. It was lovely to see them and they gave me gifts and cards with lots of lovely messages (which made me cry!) but then it finally felt as though that chapter of my life had closed and that I can move on. So, I have applied to the local CAB to do some voluntary work and things have moved really quickly - I have an interview there on Wednesday so fingers crossed! I have also re- started learning Spanish - I began last summer but got distracted and now I'm trying to make up for lost time. it's great because I really feel as though I'm making progress this time around. I am also wanting to take up a new hobby. I used to do lots of cross-stitch but my hands won't allow me to do that any more so I am thinking of trying crochet which is not such fine work. So, we'll see how that goes. All in all I feel much more positive about things.
