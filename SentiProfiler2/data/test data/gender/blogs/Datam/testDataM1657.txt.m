So I'm in the corner tavern the other day, listening to these two enlightened, albeit, not very educated, idiots debating the need for a national health-care program.
   Why is it that every booze hound is an expert on political issues? I go to the bar to drink, not talk, and certainly not to debate current affairs!!! I think from now on, I'll just stay home and drink in the privacy of my own home.
   I really hate people, especially idiots and morons.......and pretty much everyone else!!!!!!!!!!!
   Assholes!!!!!!!!!!!!!
