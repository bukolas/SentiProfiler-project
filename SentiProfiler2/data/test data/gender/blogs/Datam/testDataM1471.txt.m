I have no interest whatsoever in defending the latest round of ridiculous buck-passing going on in the House. The idea, apparently, is that they're going to pass the raft of fixes to the health care bill and simply 'deem' the Senate bill passed. Somehow this is supposed to reduce process-based attacks from the Republicans. The mind boggles. Sometimes you wonder how the Democratic Party hasn't self-immolated yet. We're talking about an absolute core principle of the party. If you aren't interested in trying to get millions of more people some basic health care than what exactly are you doing in the party anyway? And if, even worse, you're Dennis Kucinich, how can you sleep at night knowing how much good this bill would do but still opposing it because it doesn't achieve the purity of alien-inspired dreams? But now we're facing the possibility that living, breathing people who were capable of getting themselves elected to the House of Representatives in the most powerful country the world has ever seen are simultaneously so stupid that they think this legislative rigmarole is going to help them. While I've stated repeatedly that all the fuss about the 'Cornhusker kickback' and such things is mostly an illusion generated by the process, apparently House Democrats are absolutely terrified of it. So terrified that they're not even willing to go on record as having voted for the bill that contains it. Despite the fact that they're going to turn around and IMMEDIATELY vote for another bill that removes it. A bill, by the way, that will be immensely popular and create a serious bind for the Republicans. Because if they just do this the old-fashioned way, the initial vote to pass the Senate bill makes health care the law of the land. They pass it and Obama signs it and it's LAW. At that point, the Republicans in Congress are going to be faced with a seriously deadly choice. They can continue to go nuts and vote against everything health care related--but that will put them on record as attempting to SUSTAIN the 'Cornhusker kickback' and the 'Big Apple buyout' and the 'Sooner snicker-doodles' or whatever. Or, they can vote for the patch and seriously undermine their "health care is going to pay for Rahm Emanuel to kill your grandmother in a big field of corn" message. Since they will have voted for a bipartisan fix to it. But no, the Democrats want to get all fancy now, and adopt a mechanism that is questionably constitutional and stupid on the merits . The whole Democratic establishment has drawn battle lines now . Obama, the House leadership, the Senate leadership, unions, everyone. They're all making it clear that this needs to pass and that they're willing to completely withdraw electoral support for people who don't join in - even to the point of funding primary opponents. And good for them. Even if it wasn't politically smart (which it is), there are some moments when you just have to do what is right and let the chips fall where they may. I don't often like what Will Saletan has to say, but his recent piece on this is spot-on: Maybe passing the health care bill will bring on a Republican tsunami. Maybe it will create a generation of Democrats who revere Obama the way their great-grandparents revered FDR. Maybe you'll be back in Congress next year. Maybe you won't. Either way, this is too big a vote to cast on the basis of politics. Every so often, a bill comes along that's bigger than anything your predecessor got to touch. You're the lucky bastard who had your seat in 2010, when that bill reached the floor. And here you are, worrying about your career, when the purpose of your career is staring you in the face. It's time to just pass the damn bill already. If Congress wasn't full of egotistical maniacs who wanted to get everything juuuuust right this would have passed three or four months ago. Or in January. Or February. But better late than never. Just pass the damn thing and demonstrate that you're not total goobers. Begging to Bleed - Foundation The reason I like this song is that it really reminds me of "Let My Love Open the Door," except with a folksy style that reminds me a lot of the Billy Bragg/Wilco project. If that sounds appealing to you, then you'll probably like this one a lot. If not, well, I warned you. The album is called Chimborazo , and it came out last year. Are House Republicans really going to try to run ads accusing the Democrats of voting for unpopular parts of the Senate bill like the ‘Cornhusker Kickback’? Really? I know political attention spans are often as short as goldfish, but surely the counter-ad “I voted for a bill to ensure that the Cornhusker kickback was removed, while my opponent voted AGAINST that bill” would be pretty damning. Unless the Republicans are planning on voting for the patch – and thus completely ruining their “Obama = health care = teh socialism = ZOMGs” message? Okay, so they're not reuniting. But they ARE playing a show together in July. And (for all the people who have lamented being unable to actually obtain their music after hearing me rave about them), they're re-releasing their albums through my new favorite record label, Hardly Art . In addition, they've got a compilation coming out on July 13, called They’ll Only Miss You When You Leave: Songs 1996 – 2003. My only complaint on that front is that it's got only a couple tracks from Ugly But Honest (my #1 album of the past decade ). But when there's so much great stuff to choose from, you can't really get it wrong. Track list for the compilation record: 1. Low Budget Slow Motion Soundtrack Song For the Leaving Scene 2. Die 3. The Color That Your Eyes Changed With the Color of Your Hair 4. One Night Stand 5. You Should Be Hated Here 6. Drunk with the Only Saints I Know 7. Phantom Fireworks 8. So You Wanna Be A Superhero 9. Brooke Daniels' Tiny Broken Fingers 10. Ignorant Piece of Shit 11. Blessed Arms That Hold You Tight, Freezing Cold and Alone 12. Blue Champagne Glass 13. September Come Take This Heart Away 14. All Apologies and Smiles, Yours Truly, Ugly Valentine 15. Sympathy Bush 16. They'll Only Miss You When You Leave Jonathan Chait is weirdly puzzled over the lyrics to "You're So Vain" by Carly Simon (which is not about David Geffen , despite what you may have heard). Chait says: "[N]othing about the song makes any sense. She's giving an extremely detailed description of a former lover, but insisting that his being able to recognize the description is evidence of vanity." But that's why it's clever! The whole point of the song is that the person is vain, smug, self-satisfied, thinks the world revolves around himself...and is wholly justified in thinking so. At least in respect to the narrator. The song IS about him, after all. It works in the same way that a great "I'm SOOOO over you" song works. If you were really over them, you wouldn't have to write a song about it. And if she wasn't obsessed with him, then his vanity wouldn't be a problem. Right? And then there's a whole additional layer, which is that she has played the vagueness of the subject matter into a multiple-decade-long mystery. So obviously the specific stuff is meant to be true in spirit but not literally correct. The result being: there are quite a few people who might think the song is about them - and by doing so it BECOMES a song about them. Get it? Anyways, it's more fun to not know than it ever would be to get an answer. Puppets - Jose Vanders The puzzlingly named Jose Vanders (as in, she's a she) is embedded firmly in the grand tradition of waif-voiced folksy women playing sweet songs about love and life and growing up. Think of a young Regina Spektor with a bit of the Kate Nash snark. I realize that for some people that might not sound like an endorsement - in which case you're probably better off just passing through. But for those who like a little bit of sweetness in their lives, give this one a listen. In addition to being simple, pure, serene...it's also a lot of fun. The general theme ("I'm a puppet for you") doesn't feel overdone, and the clapping (following the line "I've got strings tied to my fingers, pull them down, and I'll clap for you") is amusing without treading into being precious. "Puppets" is from an EP called Red, Black, Blue, and the Tortoise , which came out a couple years ago. Fit - Windmill (from Puddle City Racing Lights ) Perfect Fit - Laurel Music (from This Night and the Next ) So I'm thinking about buying a new car. This is a pretty major deal since I've been driving the same Dodge Caravan for about 12 years now. And while I love the old minivan, the recognition of rising gas prices and the initial investment required to buy a car designed for a family leads me to believe I really ought to buy a nice little fuel-efficient car. I think I've settled on the Honda Fit. It gets great reviews, good gas mileage, is among the cheaper options out there, and apparently has the coolest folding back seat in the world which actually produces some reasonably good storage space for a small car. The question I have for you, gentle blog-readers, is this: do you have any experience, positive or negative, with the Fit? Is it a good choice? Should I be considering something else? I've written about Slapstick a few times before - and it seems strange to keep coming back to a band that's been defunct for a decade at this point. But still, I just can't say no. The excuse this time is my discovery of some tracks from them that had completely slipped under my radar. Way back in the day I picked up their Slapstick CD, which I believed to be a complete collection of their released material. Turns out there's some other stuff floating around, including this track, which embodies everything there is to love about the band: I Hate Girls - Slapstick Like a cold gust of Chicago wind reaching us all the way from some dark club in the 90s filled with snotty ska-punk of the very best sort. A dirty guitar riff, horns that rise out and above, lyrics about lusting after a girl at a Jawbreaker show, and that absolutely glorious "la la, la la la la la" chorus. What's not to like?
