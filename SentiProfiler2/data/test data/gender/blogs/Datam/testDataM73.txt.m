Mirror
Sometimes, one fails to see oneself and dwells upon ones image that he wants to potray to the society. Its all a game of illusion in ones mind. It goes like this, if i want to be someone, i train myself to be someone, but then i forget that pretending to be someone makes people fail to see the real me. The simple solution as you might assume is to be truely oneself, well unfortunately the story doesn't end there. I mean its really good for everyone to be or potray truely what they are but then we all are in our own ways of being very judgemental. It depends who can and who cannot stand against other's callous judgements. Anyways, the point i am really trying to emphasise here is that, when one doesn't like the way one is, he tries to achieve to be someone else but what happens is he ends up pretending forever even before he has reached his goal...which means that one lives in an illusion of oneself of how one wants to be seen and thats when people around him fail to see him and he himself fails to see the true him.
