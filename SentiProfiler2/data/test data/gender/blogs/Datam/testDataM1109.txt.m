Last year I made my New Year’s resolutions public on my blog. That seemed to help me complete a good handful of them (final score here). So I am going to have another go at it…

Big Stuff

Finish my pilots licence. It is just getting embarrassing at this point. 
Keep up the vacation plan and take at least 2 vacation that are more than 3 days. Hey people die at my age, got to get with it. 
At least 6 date nights with my wife. This would be more than the sum of all dates in the last 10 years (guess how old the oldest is) so this is a very aggressive goal. 
Go sailing at least 3 times (have not been since I was a kid). 
Get my wife to go sailing at least once (if I pull this one off I need a medal). 
Read at least one book that is not fiction, self help or business related. Not exactly what is left to read but there must be something out there. 
Maintain my weight (unless of course I am exposed to some freak nuclear activity that turns me into a ripped super hero overnight, in which case I will let this one go). 
Have neighbors and friends over for dinner. Small groups 1-2 couples. It is easier to dig up the dirt that way. 
Go at least once to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Hopefully the rest of the family will come too. 
The Little List

Now that I have found my foil and my kids are starting to express an interest I will bring this back to the list. Based on last years performance I am probably just being silly. 
2010 is the 20 year high school mark for both my wife and myself. Hoping we actually go so we laugh our asses off. 
Become proficient at tying my turban. There really is no reason as I could never wear it outside of the house, but man it feels great. No joke, can’t explain it but it just feels great. Help mental focus, I swear. 
Own and wear more hats. I love hats, why are they so out of fashion. 
Golf at least once. 
Make an effort to get technically better at taking photos now that I have a camera that can support it. Technically better means not having to take 200 photos to get lucky on 10. 
Take kids again on a train ride up to LA and explore. Hmmm boa and boba, sounds good right now. 
Drink more scotch (hey, I put it on the little list) 
Looking at this list it feels a little like a bucket list.
