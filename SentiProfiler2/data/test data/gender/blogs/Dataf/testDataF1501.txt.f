Well for those that don't know I am taking 10 freshman kids from school to the Grand Canyon over spring break! Yes I have lost my mind....
No I really am excited... I think! We leave early Monday morning for the airport to fly to Las Vegas. Then we fly out the red eye friday night!  So yes I am spending my Spring Break with KIDS what am I thinking? I am sure it will be a vacation I will never forget!
