Look, we all pick up bad habits around our eating. We eat more than required, or we watch the TV while eating, we eat junk food, maybe we're just depressed and don't care and food is a source of comfort - whatever your situation is, I can tell you one thing: If there is anyone who can help you best, it's yourself! Try and use affirmations and visualisation to help you focus on the way you would like to see yourself ideally. Learn  about the Glycemic Index - you probably don't have a "sweet tooth" but are stuck in what's called the "insulin trap", which causes you to eat every so often and also is the main contributor to weight gain. Set up a good exercise routine - preferably with a buddy who can motivate you and hold you accountable, I use GR2 control meal replacement shake as it keeps me feeling full for long and provides a constant source of energy from morning till lunchtime.
