I haven't posted about music in a while, but here goes. So, I'm cruising through iTunes, building a playlist of 'essentials.' There are some songs that I just have to be able to listen to whenever I want. Here, in no particular order, are a few of them. 1. Jet Airliner, by Steve Miller. (i love the joker and fly like an eagle but hear them too much) 2. Heart of Glass, by Blondie. (the original not the funky disco one *must* have the word ass or wph wtp) 3. Life in the Fast Lane, by The Eagles. (this is prolly #2 on my atf list)
