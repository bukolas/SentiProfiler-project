What to do! After meeting lots of people  in last few days i came to some conclusion. In this professional world that we all "live" in, the cut throat competition that we have been exposed to, has made our lives so miserable that it needs immediate attention. Moreover, the irony is, no one seems to be alarmed. With this viscious cycle continuing there is virtually no future! or atleast nothing that i can think of.

This mad mad race, winning at all cost,  is taking a hefty toll on one's own personal life as well. People are less happy with what they are getting and more sad for what other are getting!! I mean one should be concerned about him/her self more then the others.

Sad some of my few friends have also got this virus, i am trying hard to explain to them that please do not get into all this. Life is different and do not mess it up just by living it how others wanted you to. Don't live somebody else's life!

Sad...but true...many people have no idea what they will be doing tomorrow? Leave tomorrow they don't have idea about today!!
