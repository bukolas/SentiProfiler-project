Friends hereabouts are starting to email out pictures of their 2010 crop of foals.  That's Miniature horse foals.  Most of the pictures show the newborn in the arms of their new owners (the owners standing, holding the foals like newborn puppies.) Since a Miniature horse foal is about twenty pounds and seventeen inches tall or so.

Miniature horses don't know they're little, just as Chihuahuas don't know they're no bigger than the squirrels they chase. My main man, a stallion named Fyr, is a wild and fierce as a Montana mustang, and he's a whopping thirty inches tall, full grown. We're coming into another Spring breeding season, and as the mares start to think about being receptive, Fyr snorts and prances and is READY to do battle with anything or anyone that gets between him and the loves of his life.

I have another stallion, Talisman. One day, unthinking me, left the wrong gate open, and both stallions jump-started out into the main psture. All those 'wimmin' and two stallions; and the war was one. Screaming in rage, rearing pawing the dirt, twisting their heads in that way stallions have, and shouting obscenities at each other. They dug in like two drivers about to play "chicken" and charged.

It was a wild battle. The mares looked and gathered close (no doubt gossiping about which 'hunk' appealed to them most.) The stallions screamed and lashed out at each other, and bit and tumbled and, it was most ferocious. Dirt flew, bits of horse hair were spat out, the barn cats raced to higher ground, the barn roof, to watch.

I finally decided I had to brave the flying hooves and lunging teeth, waded in and grabbed each halter. "Knock it off, you guys." It was like breaking up a battle between two four year old kids.

I got them separated and put back where each belonged. There they were, safely in their own paddocks again. Pacing the fence, screaming at each other, "wait 'till next time, dude."

The mares wandered away, probably disappointed.
