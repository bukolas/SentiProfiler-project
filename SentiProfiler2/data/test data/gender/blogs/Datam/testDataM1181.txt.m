Earlier this morning during a keynote at SXSW, Twitter CEO and co-founder Evan Williams announced the availability of Twitter’s @Anywhere platform. It is an identity system and is widely viewed as an answer to Facebook Connect. It allows Twitter subscribers to use their Twitter credentials to login to third-party services. The announcement was short on details and left me scratching my head.

Over Twitter, I asked Evan Williams if he would offer more details. He tweeted back and said that the “details will come (specifically at Chirp).” Chirp is Twitter’s official developer conference slotted for April 14-15 and will be held in San Francisco. It could be a big week for Twitter. AllThingsD speculates that the company might also announce its plans for an ad-platform at the AdAge conference scheduled for April 12-13 in New York. There is clearly a lot of interest in San Francisco-based social messaging company which is valued at around a billion dollars and is viewed as a potential competitor to Facebook.

    We’ve developed a new set of frameworks for adding this Twitter experience anywhere on the web. …When we’re ready to launch, initial participating sites will include Amazon, AdAge, Bing, Citysearch, Digg, eBay, The Huffington Post, Meebo, MSNBC.com, The New York Times, Salesforce.com, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Imagine being able to follow a New York Times journalist directly from her byline, tweet about a video without leaving YouTube, and discover new Twitter accounts while visiting the Yahoo! home page—and that’s just the beginning. Twitter has proven to be compelling in a variety of ways. With @anywhere, web site owners and operators will be able to offer visitors more value with less heavy lifting.
