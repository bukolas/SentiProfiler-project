jaya....my closest and most favourite cousin...blood must be the ONLY conection between the two of us cuz otherwise, together, we make the rail tracks.... never do we converge...! though we don meet each other very often or keep in youch, i know that if not anyone, if i need any kind of family support for anything, she will be by my side... thts the kinda weird relationship i ve with this kiddo...shes a yr older yet is a kid in the head... 
conversations starts where the ended last, with the two of us.... we don complain abt that... i can bank on her for all the support n help i need and she knows that its vice versa too.... 
LOVE U SIS! :) :D
