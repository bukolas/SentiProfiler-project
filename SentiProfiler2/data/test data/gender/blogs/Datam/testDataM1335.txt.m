Difficult question... first, no macs aren't the answer and im not a mac hater im actually using one right now. You need to understand no computer that's connected to the internet can EVER be completely safe from viruses, Trojans and worms but precautions like virus scanners or internet security suites help. I recommend Mcafee and Norton because there updated quicker and because they have extra precautions others don't have. You can actually get mcafee for free sign in or sign up for aol and go to downloads section they offer an aol enhanced version under the security tab.
