I don’t have any concrete ideas or plot ideas for this new story other than the characters, what they’re like and personalities. I do have things that I want to happen in the story but I haven’t a clue how they happen or who/what causes them. I know I want an evil dictator, a school of magic, and an epic show down at some point (probably near the end). I want this story to have some crazy plot twist that completely change everything in the story and confuses the heck out of the reader.
