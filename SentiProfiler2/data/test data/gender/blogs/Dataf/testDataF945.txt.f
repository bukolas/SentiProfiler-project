Why is it that the second a song becomes heard of, be it by a friend, your whole group of friends, or even the media in general, suddenly you feel you own the right to it. I often worry this trend is becoming more and more popular; what with the ease through which we can download music these days, pretty much everyone has access to the same music as everyone else. Nothing remains personal, it's all out there and once it hits the mainstream and gets overplayed you know there's no going back. Suddenly that song that's stuck around your top 25 most played for the last 4 and a half years, is suddenly the one that makes you want to tear your hair out and fill your ears with cotton candy every time you hear it played.

Perhaps there's a bonus to this though. Our natural instinct to solve problems kicks in, prompting us to ensure there's music out there that we can always keep personal. Now I don't mean we should go and kidnap awesome artists and bands, I'm talking about originality. When we dislike the way someone makes our drink what do we do? Make it ourselves: make it better. There's nothing stopping all these people who complain about the lack of less mainstream music from getting their hindquarters off of their computer chairs and going out there to make their own. Music actually is EVERYWHERE. What do we need to make it really? A little creativity, and despite how much people may disagree I think it's fair to say everyone maintains a pinch of that. Everything we say throughout the day comes from our own mouths (hopefully), we create our words. Our inner sense of who we are creates a personality for us. There is no such thing as a lack of innovation: there's another special word for that. It's just pure laziness.
