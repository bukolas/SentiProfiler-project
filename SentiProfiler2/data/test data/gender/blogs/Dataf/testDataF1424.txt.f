My husband and I love watching "Arrested Development" on DVD.  We need to buy the series already!!  We have rented the entire 3 seasons from Netflix too many times to count.  What I really want to know is who made the decision to take this series off the air?  I mean seriously, are they still employed at Fox or what?  I would love to hear your comments if you know the answer or even want to rant.
