The scenario is again played on a 2' x 2' skirmish board. The terrain is all woods, with a few odd boulders thrown in, and small stones used as encounter markers. Only Figaro and Manon start on the board (in the lower right-hand corner). There is a thick fog shifting and swirling about, so visibility is limited to d10+4" and changes each turn. The visibility on each turn is indicated in parentheses at the start of that turn's description.
