Hot,hotter and hottest Chennai has finally turned into a better place.Thanks to the showers! But despite the rare downpours in Chennai, a few people still despise the rain. I’ve always wondered why people don’t like the rain. Rain enlivens the lifeless earth, gives a fresh look to the otherwise dry leaves, ensures a free supply of  ‘water-the elixir of life’ throughout the year and above all isn’t it beautiful ? Rain has served as an inspiration for many poets independent of the language in which they write. Rain songs have become a part and parcel of every movie just like the item numbers.And, invariably the Rain song is a definite hit! Not just a hit, most rain songs are beautiful too.Is it just the music that brings the beauty ? Definitely not.. Its the rain itself which adds beauty to the song.The rhythm of the rain drops falling, the crystal showers filling the place, the beautiful heroine dancing in the rain.. (does she dance to the song or to the rhythm of the rain ?? .. I’ve always wondered! ) Isn’t it magical ?
