It’s easy to imagine Larry Keigwin choreographing a Beyoncé video, even if you didn’t know he got his start as a backup dancer on Club MTV. Please don’t mistake that for faint praise (who doesn’t love her “Single Ladies”?), only a nod to this witty stylist’s pop sensibilities. In the meantime Mr. Keigwin is fast making inroads on the concert dance circuit. On Tuesday night Keigwin & Company, formed in 2003, had its first solo week at the Joyce Theater, performing repertory works and a premiere before a full, enthusiastic house.

The new work, “Bird Watching,” shows Mr. Keigwin as engaged as ever in people watching. Preening and plumage aren’t just for the birds, and here five dancers, dressed in Fritz Masten’s glittery black-and-white costumes (figure skating comes to mind), strut and swoop to Haydn’s Symphony No. 6 in D.

The chandelier and cream-colored backdrop signal grandeur, as does Burke Wilmore’s buttery lighting. But these characters are surely nouveau riche, with their hip-jutting attitude and flashy jewels. In one of the most striking motifs they rapidly fan their ring-bearing hands in front of their faces, simultaneously coy and attention grabbing.

Mr. Keigwin’s mix of kinetic street energy and academic technique is always pleasing (as is his nonchalant inclusion of homosexuality, at a time when too much dance remains closeted onstage; a section in another work, “Mattress Suite,” is cheekily titled “Straight Duet”). But “Bird Watching” feels a bit dutiful to me, especially when followed by “Runaway” (2008), a nasty-edged world of mannequins and suits set to Jonathan Melville Pratt’s propulsive “Thirteen.”
