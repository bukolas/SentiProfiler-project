I keep wanting to use the word webinar, but I can't decide if it is too jargony. This  lexical conundrum reminds me of when the word workout went mainstream. It sounded too jargony  to me, and I used to say go-to-the-gym and a not-so-snappy stand-in.

Should I use the word webinar?

Should I tell you how many times Ryan Paugh told me that I have to announce the webinar if I want people to come to it? I kept not announcing anything because I didn't know what to call it.

Whatever we are calling it, it will happen on this Friday, 1pm est. (Sign up here.) I know that people in Australia cannot listen at this time slot. You have told me before, and I'm listening. One day I will do a webinar at midnight. One day I will record webinars so it won't matter so much what time slot they happen in. One day there will be world peace.

On Friday we will talk about finding fulfillment, which is actually like establishing world peace, just doing it one person at a time. In an act of full disclosure, I'm going to tell you that knowing what to do is not the hard part of finding fulfillment. Doing it is the hard part. It's like breaking up with a terrible boyfriend when the sex is really good. Not that I have ever had this problem. I have found that part of what makes a terrible boyfriend is terrible sex. But whatever. I can imagine the problem. The problem is that you  know what to do and you don't do it.

Wait. Actually, that's the problem with everything. Like, I knew I was going to have to write a post about the webinar where I don't know if I should use the word webinar. I knew it wasn't going to change if I waited so long to write the post that Ryan Paugh wants to kill me. But I waited anyway. Why do we not take the action that we know is the right action? I will not be covering this problem in the webinar.
