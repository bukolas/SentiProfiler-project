In all my years of reading horror comics I've learned this important fact: corpses are razor sharp, and if you're not careful you can very easily cut yourself on one and start bleeding. What the hell am I talking about you ask? Well read on then if you don't understand or believe me. I mean, what--- you think someone actually makes this stuff up?!! From the February 1952 issue of Mysterious Adventures #6 More Mysterious Adventures all this week--- stay tuned! +++++++++++++++++++ NEWS ITEM: Jason Paulos is an Australian comic artist that has worked for DC comics and Judge Dredd Megazine , and his new solo horror anthology EEEK! is his love letter to retro horror comics, (in particular Charlton, HOM, Warren , and to a lesser extent 80's staples like Death Rattle and Twisted Tales .) Says Jason, "If you made a movie of EEEK! it would be described as the bastard child of Evil Dead and Austin Powers . One of the story titles is " Death Wears Hotpants" so you can draw your own conclusions from that." For more info click HERE! Oh god, not another insane Iger Shop tale from the Aug-Sept. 1954 issue of Strange Fantasy #13 ?!! Yep. This scuzzy supernatural three-way is actually a leftover from our sordid Valentine's Day Massacre Fest from last month, I totally had it on the schedule and then forgot all about it. Share it now with the one/s you love (to death.) Hey, how about a second helping of corpse for dinner? Check the THOIA Archive for the Reed Crandell classic--- "The Corpse That Came to Dinner!" ---NEWS FLASH!!--- It's FINALLY coming! You've read his comments here at THOIA for years, now get ready to read Mike Howlett's "The Weird World of Eerie Publications," coming in Fall 2010 from Feral House! A labor of undying love, and over 4 grueling years in the monstrous making, this blood soaked tome is the definitive look at this much maligned publisher of the lowest of the low brow horror comics! (Stay tuned for pre-order information!) I mentioned filmmaker William Castle in the last THOIA post "Monsters for Rent" because of the gimmick angle to that story (we all know Castle was The Master at goofishly grand gimmicktry), and I'm going to mention him again today too because of the House on Haunted Hill-esque, skeleton-producing, acid pool angle to today's lurid Iger Shop classic. Castle could have made a real doozy out of this one--- Filmed in Dissolvo-Vision!Â© From the Aug-Sept. 1954 issue of Strange Fantasy #13 . Sam and Lorna Cox, aka: "The Dipshits of Disaster." They could surely learn a thing or two about gimmicks from The King, William Castle ... unfortunantly for them though it's now much too late. From the October 1953 issue of Haunted Thrills #3 . The last Wally Wood story from the February 1955 issue of This is Suspense #23 (originally presented in the May 1950 issue of A Star Presentation #3 ), PLUS! a Marvel / Atlas story submission from THOIA reader Ben Evans, "The Nightmare Men" by Mac Pakula , originally presented in the June 1957 issue of Strange Tales of the Unusual #10 . Says Ben, "This is more or less what I always interpreted Dream Police by Cheap Trick as being about." Haha, thanks again for the scans Ben! It's strange to think that in all the years of managing THOIA this is only my third Wally Wood post. I assure you this will be rectified throughout 2010. And now the exciting conclusion to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (originally featured in the May 1950 issue of A Star Presentation #3 . ) NEXT: More Wally Wood! But if you can't wait, check the THOIA Archives from May 2008 for-- The Thing from the Sea! While the Feb. '55 issue of This is Suspense #23 is technically the first issue of this short lived series (formerly known as Strange Suspense Stories ) it is also the last pre-code issue. And however you look at it, whether kicking things off big, or the sad end to an "anything goes" era, you certainly can't go wrong with a reprint of Wally Wood's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (originally featured in the May '50 issue of A Star Presentation #3 .) This is definitely not Wood's best work, but it's still tremendous fun seeing him hone his imaginative skill during this phase of his career. (to be continued...) Closing out February with another double header, our first story from the May '74 issue of Tales of the Zombie #5 is a favorite of mine and contains one of the saddest, most chilling endings in any horror story ever. And for you people jonesin' for some damn 50's style pre-code already, I've included the Stan Lee / George Tuska reprint classic "Acid Test!" from the Oct. '73 issue of Tales of the Zombie #2 , (originally presented in the July '53 issue of Menace #5 under the title "Nightmare!")
