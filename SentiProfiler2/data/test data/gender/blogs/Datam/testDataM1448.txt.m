I received a fun email yesterday from Lindsay, telling me about the "Co-Ed Bent Objects Birthday Party" she had.  She and her friends created some pretty good Bent Objects-like scenarios (I especially like the burrito one), and I'm flattered that she chose my work as the theme to her party and to have fun with.Also, I shared on my Twitter a while back a link to Szymon's Inspire Me Now blog. It was quite a hit.  Need some inspiration, or just feel like checking out other people's awesome work? You should go there. Right now.Speaking of being inspired by things on the web-I've been thinking a lot lately about how I believe that the web is speeding up creative's progressions.  Of course, it's speeding up learning and sharing in every field, from scientists being able to share findings with each other in real time, to people sharing info on Twitter to form instant political protests.  My particular interest is about creativity though.  No longer do artists have to wait to have a gallery showing to get a lot of feedback.  They can join an internet group and show others their work, and have discussions about it.  No more waiting on a certain book or even  a certain magazine to come out to see what the rest of the world is doing.  The give and take between people who create is now happening on a daily, hourly, and instant basis. I find this all kind of mind-blowing whenever I think about it.  If you love art, design, crafting, film, animation, etc, these are extremely exciting times
