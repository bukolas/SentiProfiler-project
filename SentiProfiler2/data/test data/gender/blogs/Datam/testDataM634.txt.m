I remember Edal as a sweet n calm like acting gal..Very gud at heart 'nd seriously d sweetest thingi on earth!
Although we've not been in touch for years we became close in no time..
romba calm type. Evaloda face actress 'Anuya' vuku doopu pota madiri irukum..evala pathi solrathuku kandipa oru testi pathathu.
hmm she believes everyone.bcoz of dat one stupid tried to fool her..
later oly she realised..ithula irunthu ena theriyuthu ena mathri pudhisali ah irukanum..
seri vidu sila unmaigal kasaka thaan seyum..hmm she hates studies jus like me.but last minute la padichiduva kedi ponu..
n one more thng she is very very talkative.nvr closes her mouth..am better thn her..hmm i donno wat else to tell coz i cant find wrds to describe her.
I am very happy and lucky to have Edal as my BEST FRIEND!!! ..
hmm i pray to god dat our fndship shud last forever.be my frnd always.wish u all success.
with lottss of love.
Felix...
