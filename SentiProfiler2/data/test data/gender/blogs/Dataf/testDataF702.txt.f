If there was anything more terrible than Rena Riffel’s attempt to create a Showgirls sequel, it was the German filmmaker (I use the term loosely) who did it first and is causing an internet phenomenon about just how bad it is.But when Rena Riffel (an actor who played one of the dancers in the first film) came out with her teaser for a film that hasn’t been made (with a drag showgirl and embarassing acting) the Marc Vorlander decided to make a public statement that really doesn’t help his cause.
