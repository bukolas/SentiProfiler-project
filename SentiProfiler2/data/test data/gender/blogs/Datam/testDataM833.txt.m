Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion is the best computer/game console game ever known to man. I got hooked on the Elder Scrolls Series starting with Morrowind about 3 years ago and still enjoy playing it now. Oblivion starts where Morrowing ended, but its is a totally different world with different objectives and charaters plus if you get the Game Of The Year Edition you get 2 bonus expansion packs with it. You get "Knights of the Nine" and "Shivering Isles".
