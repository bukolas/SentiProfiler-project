yes i won't be able to fight with those kuffar who raped my sister in islam... i won't able to get back her honour...but i will struggle for it that next time non of my sisters in islam get raped by kuffar... i will struggle with my pen...i will write about it in books and computer...i will try to make my muslim brothers to wake up....to do something before they end up raping with our own sisters too....
