Recommendation engine Hunch confirms that they’ve raised a new round of financing – $12 million – led by Khosla Ventures. Partner Gideon Yu, who joined  Khosla Ventures last year, was previously the CFO of Facebook. He is now joining Hunch’s board of directors as part of the deal. Hunch was valued at $52 million in the round.

I spoke to cofounder Caterina Fake this evening about the round. Fake says that Hunch, which is less than a year old, now has lots of data to work with in making recommendations. In fact, she says, users have answered nearly 50 million questions on Hunch since launch, and the company can use that data to make better and better recommendations.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales joined the company’s board of directors in late 2009.
It goes without saying that timing is everything. You can be like Friendster and show up too soon to the social networking party and then blow it. Or you can be like the iPod and make a splash despite being a late entrant to the MP3 player market. Unity Technologies, a 3-D gaming platform, has seen this movie from all sides. After struggling for nearly six years, the company’s gaming platform took off when Apple released iPhone and iPod touch.

With a platform that lets developers build lightweight, online 3-D games — perfectly suited for the iPhone OS-based devices — Unity became a disruptor in the games business virtually overnight. And it’s been on a bit of a roll over the past year, with a client roster that includes big names like Electronic Arts, the Cartoon Network and Disney. Mobile developers love the company, which secured a $5.5 million Series A round led by Sequoia in October of 2009. But it wasn’t always salad days for the company, which was originally based in Copenhagen, Denmark and is now headquartered in the Bay Area, as is made clear in my chat with Unity CEO David Helgason.
What do you think of when everything around you suddenly slows down? When you are acutely aware of every tenth of a second as it passes?

I woke up Saturday morning to Kat's music in her room. When I looked in on her, she was dancing. Spinning in circles with her arms and hands outstretched, a huge smile on her face with her hair thrown around. "UP, Daddy! UP!" So I picked her up and danced to Itsy bitsy spider. Her face in mine, watching her smile and hearing her giggle. We spun around together like grinning fools, enjoying the moment. Nothing else really mattered.

AS the truck tire fell off the pavement, the DOT hadn't plowed and the front end swung around, I wasn't driving fast. Maybe 55 MPH. The roads were a mess, snow covered and no way to tell where the shoulder hid, waiting to pull you down to a catastrophe.

The boy has been sick. He had my cold and now has my cough. He has a rash and other problems that make him miserable. Last night Jill and I held him and tried to comfort him. He would have none of it. He stood and screamed at the injustice of it all; why did HE have to hurt? Did he really want these teeth? We held him and tried to comfort him and share his frustration.

The truck is sliding sideways, free of friction from the road and the tires held to nothing, just sliding over snow and ice. The headlights pointed into the median and the road starting to curve into my travel. Counter steer, just like I was taught in drivers ed, over 25 years ago. Pray, just like I was taught at home nearly 40 years ago.

Kat, wound up and cranky. Cabin fever making her temper boil. I found her at the door, in her jacket, hat and mittens. Crying to DO SOMETHING. Outside? Sled, she tells me. So I dressed quickly, put on her boots and carried her out and got the sled. I tell her to hold on and enjoy! She is going down the hill, faster and farther. Looking back for the security of daddy watching over her. Laughter and dancing, jumping up and down. Again! Again. Four trips in all, up the hill, position in the sled and point down the hill. GO! down the hill, faster than before, I hear her calling, Daddy!

There is a van stuck in the median. The truck has swung nearly 180* and I see the van coming up on my left. Or is it? The van is still, I am shooting towards it when the back of the truck hits the thick, wet, sticky snow of the median and the front end snaps around like a whip. The van seems to pass me by, when I should know I am the passer by. Nose into the deeper snow, slowing down as though I just drove into a lake. Snow splashing up all around, I see the snow pass over the hood and past my windows. How deep will I go?

Sunday morning, Jill took Kyle to the dr, leaving Kat home with me. Kat is mommy's little girl and spends a half hour crying for MOMMY! and looking all over the house trying to find her mommy. I distract her finally with the music from the day before and once again we are dancing, cheek to cheek. In a rare moment of perspective, I marvel and appreciate the moment. She doesn't want me to hold her often and we don't dance together. "This is precious and I don't want it to stop." I am in the moment and I know what priceless really means.

The truck is nearly in the other lane. Headlights flash in front of me, staring into my eyes. This makes it hard to see and I have my eyes open to meet my fate. What will happen when I finally come to rest? I am now heading back towards the middle of the median, snow showering all around me. Will my planner hit me in the head? Will my flashlight shake free and fracture my teeth? Will I be a burden to my family, paralyzed or blind? Is this all karma; am I wearing clean underwear?

A rough night last night. Wife and I got back to sleep around 530. We snuggled up close and dozed off. We had each gone to the children to help them get through the night and back to sleep. One woke the other and they both resented the interruption of sleep. We all did. Jill and I hit snooze and we wound ourselves closer to one another. I murmured in her ear; we used to do this every morning, BK. We cuddled and snuggled and stored up love and affection like squirrels storing nuts, corporate life is like a stark freezing Iowa winter. Store up your love and affection because outside of this house you don't have many friends or allies to help nourish your spirit. Some days that nourishment of your spirit runs out before you get to the safe haven of home.

I realize the truck has some response in the wheel. Maybe I can, I think. I am at the bottom of the hill, I have been plowing snow for a quarter mile. Give it some gas and steer. The worst that can happen is unthinkable; the best that can happen is still possible. The truck responds to the foot feed and slogs its way in the deep snow. Thirty more yards, twenty then five and OUT! We are on the road! Careful, don't go to the other ditch and look for cars coming down that hill! Keep driving a little faster, up to 45 and pointed in the right direction. Lets get home carefully, safely; ten miles to go and the road isn't any cleaner.

I park the truck at home and feel kind of weak. shut the garage door and go inside. It is too much to hope the kids are up; it is 8:15. DADDY'S HOME. A bundle of long brown curly hair runs out of her bedroom and throws herself around my knees. UP, UP, UP she commands. I pick up my daughter and a tear slides down my cheek. Jill comes into the kitchen carrying Kyle and we have a group hug. A hug has never been more precious or needed than right at that moment. I would freeze that moment in time if I could and never regret it. 

I feel like it took thirty minutes to drive through that median and another hour to get home but that hug lasted for barely an instant.
The Nexus One is coming to Verizon — no, really, two months after a deal was announced by Google, the device is on its way. HTC has begun shipping the CDMA version of Google’s Nexus One to Verizon Wireless, according to a report in the Chinese-language Economic Daily News (hat tip, Digitimes). The nation’s largest carrier will begin selling the gadget in the next few weeks, joining T-Mobile USA, which has supported the “Google phone” since its January launch. But that won’t do much to boost Google’s mobile effort unless Mountain View throws some real marketing muscle behind the Nexus One.

There’s a lot to like about the Nexus One, which Om has praised as “the best Android phone yet.” The phone rocks the powerful 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and solid mobile browser, and is closely integrated with applications from both Google and third-party developers. But sales have been tremendously disappointing, prompting Goldman Sachs last week to slash its 2010 sales estimates for the Nexus One by a whopping 70 percent.

That lack of movement can be directly traced to an almost utter lack of marketing for the phone. (That’s a lesson Palm has learned with its Pre. Twice.) Google’s promotion of its flagship device consisted largely of a placing a modest link on its home page, and carriers — which are rightly terrified of their brands being elbowed out of the way — have only minimally backed the gadget. Worse, the phone is available only through Google’s online store, which most smartphone shoppers surely don’t even know exists. And that model isn’t likely to change with Verizon Wireless, as Kevin at jkOnTheRun noted last week.

Google has said since January that the Nexus One would be coming to Verizon Wireless, and the company is wise to combine its impressive hardware with Verizon’s rock-solid network. But if Google is really going to move the needle with its flagship device, it’s going to have to back it with some big-budget marketing campaigns.
During the review of the Environmental Protection Agency budget in today’s Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing, both Senator Barbara Boxer — the chair of the committee — and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson distanced themselves from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).

Boxer and Jackson’s statements, in addition to being a striking change in policy, are problematic because U.S. climate science is very closely tied to the IPCC reports (as Christopher Horner showed in his recent PJM series on the NASA FOIA emails.)

The statements by Boxer and Jackson followed Senator Inhofe’s release (see the PJM exclusive report) in his opening statement of a minority staff report documenting many flaws in the IPCC report and the other evidence revealed in the Climategate files. (See the full hearing on CSPAN here; the exchanges with Senator Boxer and Inhofe, and Administrator Jackson begin at about 56 minutes into the video.)
Hey BlackBerry friends -- we've got some news for you. The Engadget application (which is also available for the iPhone / iPod touch  and webOS devices) has gone and gotten itself a little update on RIM's platform. It's nothing crazy, but we've made some bug fixes, and more importantly, added support for 5.0 devices (Bold, Curve, and Tour)! The devs also thoughtfully included keyboard shortcuts (T, B, N, P, and the spacebar) in this version for your convenience. All you have to do to get your hands on this baby is point your phone's browser to our download page, or if you've already got the app installed, it should prompt you for an update automatically next time you open it. Storm users -- we are working on a version for you as well, and everyone who is curious about the Android app: you should see it released this month!
Time for your Tuesday edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Find more of Drew's stuff at KSK or on Twitter. Today, we're poop, menus, Minesweeper, afros, death, Gatorade, gayness, and more.

I've been losing weight recently, and one of the joys of losing weight is overemphasizing my own awe at my body's transformation. "Why are my pants so loose? Why am I not sweating in my sleep? I feel stronger. More agile. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY BODY?" I'm not saying I'm becoming Spiderman, but I wouldn't rule out such things. Also, my old Kasabian shirt fits again. It's the little things. Onto your letters.

Carlos:

    Me and my brother have come to the conclusion that whoever dies first will haunt the shit out of the other person. I'm gonna be a bad motherfuckin' ghost if I die, I will pull your teeth while you sleep, you bastard. FEAR ME.

Well, that's the main issue. Can you move around tangible objects when you're a ghost? Because that would be awesome. If you're a ghost, you have to be bored out of your mind, what with the whole stuck in purgatory business. The only thing there is to do if you're a ghost is spend most of your time fucking with the living. And so, like Carlos, I'd be a HUGE dick if I were a ghost. I'd turn on the faucets while you were taking a shit, just so you'd clench up, break off the turd, and get all mad. Also, I'd write out lots of vague messages on steamy bathroom mirrors. Shit like, THIS IS THE DAWN OF THE END. Also, I'd implore people in the house to avenge my death, even if I died normally. They don't know I died of a heart attack, so why not give them the illusion that I was murdered in the house, and that they must find the killer? OLD MAN JENKINS NEXT DOOR! YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM!

There are times, late at night, when my wife is asleep but I'm still tossing and turning, when I wonder if our house is haunted. It's not. But what if the specter of some old lady came through the wall and just stared at me? What would I do, apart from shit my pants? I visualize that shit, and then it fucks with me the rest of the night.

At college, one of the guys I sat on the football bench with told me his dorm room was haunted. One night, he was sleeping in his bed. He stirred, opened his eyes, and saw a dark figure standing by the bed. When he reached to touch the figure, his hand went through it. He turned on the light and there was nothing there. HAUNTED! Sure, he was almost certainly lying. But then again, there could have been a girl who had her throat slit by a demented professor in that very same room. I rule out nothing. Just once, I'd like to find myself in a haunted house or hotel room. Just so I can tell people of my brush with the paranormal.

I get very annoyed with reality shows about ghosts (like Ghost Hunters) that supposedly track ghosts and then come up with proof that includes a video still featuring a smudge of light glare. That's no ghost, you fuckers. Where are the chains?!
This has been the long, hot summer of ObamaCare. The president’s plan to change our health care system has led to ugly confrontations between ardent supporters and those who want no part of it. Repeatedly, arguments have broken out where opponents object to some provision and the president’s zealots retort that they’re lying or have been duped.

I would like to suggest that such arguments are beside the point. The specifics of the legislation are shifting and liable to change. What’s really important is the overall concept. We’re used to hearing that “the devil is in the details,” but in this instance, we should instead concentrate on the big picture.

Here is the big picture: Do we want a health care system that’s overwhelmingly political in nature? President Obama believes we need a system mainly directed by federal mandates and prohibitions. If he has his way, our already somewhat politicized system would become heavily politicized. Supposedly that would be in the public interest.

There are many Americans, however, who think that a heavily politicized health care system would be much worse. I’m among them. We believe, fundamentally, that systems of any kind that are dominated by politics do not do a good job of satisfying human needs. Whether it’s health care, food, housing, or anything else, government intrusion leads to increasing costs, declining quality, and the loss of freedom.

We get far better results from systems based on freedom and voluntary exchange. When individuals make decisions, they know their own circumstances and will either benefit from good choices or suffer the consequences of bad ones. That creates a strong incentive to make good choices and quickly change when you realize you’ve made a mistake.
I'm back from my trip overseas and had a blast! But fun was coupled with sadness as day 1 I lose my phone :( That screwed a bit with my plans to tour around as I lost my handy internet-in-pocket device. Germany was great, meetings went really well and the weather was great. Then onto Amsterdam for vacation where it rained a bit everyday, but was still decent weather (and much better than home, so no complaints). One of the work guys ended up coming with me and we met up with friends from his old job. It was definitely a blast being down there with a big group of Canadians right in the middle of the Olympics. Especially since everywhere but North America lists the medal count by # of Golds, so Canada was #1.

Don't really want to type out any stories from the trip, but small 'highlights' were:
Losing phone, breaking glasses, waking up in a small pool of blood (lol), yummy schnitzel, a million gorgeous Audis, Dutch girls > German girls, Casino fun / insane beats, crazy last minute bookings and contingency plans, touring Red Light district, shopping, etc etc.

Really can't wait for another trip like this, I love travelling...but the downside, I missed my son like crazy! It was SO nice when I got him back. We've had a lot of fun so far since I got back especially because the weather's starting to be nice finally. We're spending a lot of time outside as he chases down birds and plays with rocks etc. He chases me down the street with his hands up to his head like horns or antlers all the while growling as loud as he can. It's hilarious and passerby's can't help but laugh too. On my trip there were so many times I wish I had him with me, love being reunited.



BUT you know what's insanely stupid?!?! Ex never went to visit her family. No road trip, nothing. Ie, absolutely no reason to use the piece of L's luggage I requested and was adamantly denied since she "needed" it. Such BS!
Using a camera as an input device is hardly a new idea -- even on a mobile device -- but most examples so far have been to enable functionality not possible on a touchscreen. As Master's student Daniel Bierwirth has shown in the video after the break, however, a phone on a camera can also be used as an alternative input method for features like scrolling or zooming, potentially allowing for easier interaction on devices with smaller screens. Bierwirth also takes the idea one step further, and sees the system eventually including a second camera that's worn by a person, which would be able to detect when your hands are near the phone and allow for a range of other gestures. Check out his full report at the link below.
To find out what the situation is like in Angers, I decided to go and have a walk around the city centre, and see what was open, what was closed, and if I came across any angry protestors. Angry protestors I did not find. But was Angers crippled by these strikes or not? Let’s find out.

When walking into down, it did appear to me that it felt a bit quieter than normal. There did not seem to be same number of cars which there normally are through the city centre. There were fewer buses running today in Angers, but not to the extent where there were no buses. There seemed to be adequate buses running and on the buses there did not seem to be crushes of people trying to get anywhere.

Moving into the town, no shops or banks were closed. It did not seem that any of Angers’ banks were closed.

The main thing which I found in the town was an increase in children. When walking into town, I noticed that the school near where I live was closed: I could see chairs on tables in the building. In town, it was evident that schools and colleges were closed. In the centre of town there were college students skateboarding in the central square, which usually happens only at weekends.

Moreover, there were many mothers with their children in town today. Seemingly trying to find something to do with them. Many times I saw a mother with one or two children with her. Also I came across a snake of 20 or so 4 or 5 year olds being looked after two or three women. Seemingly not enough of them to look after the children who they were looking after.

Also I came across a group of 14/15 year olds walking through town, about 25/30 of them, obviously not at school today, on a kind of shopping trip instead, all of them with H&M bags.

The amount of children and teenagers in the town centre obviously meant that many educational establishments were today closed today.

I then went across town to check out what was happening at the station. On the face of things you wouldn’t know anything was wrong. All the cancelled trains appear to have been taken off the departure board to hide the problems perhaps. Whatever, there seemed to be enough trains running today through Angers, only difference on the board was the addition of “Autocar” by some destinations.

Even the post office was open, albeit with a reduced service. Evidently some staff must have stayed away as there was a sign at the door saying that they were only serving people who wanted to send mail or make cash withdrawals.

Services like the firemen seemed to be unaffected, luckily! However when passing the fire station I did see the following:
Custom computer cases that look like spiders aren't generally the sort of thing that are available to public, but Lian Li's new PC-T1R case is one big exception to the rule, and it's now edged a bit closer to a release. Previously only seen in a teaser video, a nearly final version of the case has now landed in the hands of the folks at techPowerUp, who have provided us with our first hands-on look at it. What's more, the site also says that the case should sell for "around €150" (or just over $200) when it's released, and that it will be available in black in addition to red. Of course, there will be some assembly required -- hit up the link below to see what's in store.
The New York Times's City Room blog included a Friday piece on the orphaned Web site of Hiram Monserrate, a former state senator who is again running for office.  From "When Not to Accept Comments:"

    Now, as many will remember, the former Queens legislator was tossed out of the State Senate in February after he was convicted of assaulting his female companion. His vacant seat will be filled in a special election on March 16 — an election in which, improbably, the disgraced Mr. Monserrate is also a candidate, on the newly formed and hopefully (or is it cynically?) named Yes We Can! line. (This proves, definitively, that you can usually find more than enough New Yorkers to take part in any crazy idea you have.)

    Candidate Monserrate (Yes We Can, Queens) doesn’t have a Web site for this campaign. But a few disgruntled residents found his old site and left some less-than-friendly messages.

Conveniently left unmentioned is the party to which Monserrate claimed allegiance as recently as last month.  As reported in The New York Times on February 9, 2010:

    The State Senate on Tuesday expelled a senator convicted of domestic assault, the first time in nearly a century that the Legislature has forced a member from office.

    The Senate voted 53-to-8 to immediately oust the senator, Hiram Monserrate, a Queens Democrat convicted last fall of a misdemeanor for dragging his companion down the hallway of his apartment building.

Amazing, isn't it, how quickly party affiliation is overlooked when the perp is a Democrat?  And yet, as documented repeatedly here on NewsBusters, quite predictable.

Many people (including myself) have come to the conclusion that Gmail, with its threaded messages, spam filtering, and vast storage space, is one of the web’s best webmail providers. In fact, we like it so much that we use it for both our personal accounts and work accounts using Google Apps. But that also poses a problem: many of us wind up having to maintain two separate Google accounts, which means we have to swap logins whenever our Gmail, Reader, or other data is stored under the other account. Fortunately, there may be an end in sight for this juggling act.

As today’s SXSW panel on Gmail came to a close, the panelists revealed one last juicy tidbit: they’re working to resolve the problems with multiple namespaces that users have to deal with. The team didn’t get specific — they simply repeated that they have to deal with the same problems, as they have “@google.com” accounts for work and standard Gmail accounts for personal use. And they know it’s a pain.

There’s no time frame, and we have no idea what form the feature will take. But at least we know Google is working on it.
Did you watch any of the health-care summit yesterday in Washington? Guess what? The Republicans and Democrats are divided and likely can't find any common ground. All the morning press reports suggest that the Democrats may now use the parliamentary procedure known as "reconciliation" to pass a health-care bill with a simple majority and without any Republicans.

Rather than just repeat the arguments I've made repeatedly about the critical need for health-care reform in this country, and to include the tens of millions who are currently without health insurance (and sounding like a Democrat to some of you), let's get theological. Republicans, of course, have also used reconciliation before to pass measures they wanted--like the Bush tax cuts. So, let's look at that theologically.

First, the tax cuts that George Bush pushed through Congress overwhelmingly benefited the richest people in America--virtually all analysts agree with that fact. But many Americans haven't really calculated that the cost of those tax cuts for the rich was literally double what health-care reform is projected to cost. Double. Yet, there was not even a mention from Republicans, then or now, about the fiscal cost of such enormous tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America. And now they are doing everything they can to stoke public outrage about the cost of health-care reform (even though the Congressional Budget Office says the President's proposal will likely reduce the deficit by $100 billion over the next decade). How does that square with the biblical emphasis on the priority of the poor? There is simply no way to justify the habitual behavior of the current Republican party's clear preference for the rich over everybody else. Probably my best friend in the Congress was Republican Senator Mark Hatfield. The current Republican Party is a very different one than it was in Hatfield's time. I know he would not have liked the "theology" of his party today.

Second, the largest single government discretionary expense is for the military, for fighting wars. Military spending is also, historically, the most wasteful form of government spending with cost overruns, fiscal abuse, political corruption, and shameful pork barrel interests all part of standard operating procedures. So why is there a continual refusal from Republicans to apply their concerns about waste, fraud, and abuse about government expenditures to those expenditures? How does that square with the biblical call to peacemaking and the Christian doctrine that is, at least, suspicious of war as the answer to the problems of human conflict, which should either be outright rejected or very reluctantly accepted as an absolute last resort? There is simply no possible biblical mandate for giving the military a blank check as the current Republicans almost always do now. Again, this would have been bad theology for the evangelical Mark Hatfield, who courageously opposed the war in Vietnam.
CNN went into full tilt in promoting its upcoming pro-gender "reassignment" documentary "Her Name Was Steven" with Anderson Cooper's interview of Chastity "Chaz" Bono, the daughter of Sonny Bono and Cher, on his AC360 program on Thursday. Cooper very sympathetically interviewed Bono, and threw softball questions, even going so far as to ask, "How do you like shaving?"

The anchor heralded the "extraordinary transformation" of his guest at the top of the 10 pm Eastern hour, and noted that "in a rare interview, he [Bono] talks about life as a man and the journey he's still undergoing." Prior to the first segment of the interview at the bottom of the hour, Cooper aired a report from CNN's Gary Tuchman on "how Chastity became Chaz." The correspondent confused the English language to the point of referring to Bono with a male possessive pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, and then referring Bono as "she" within the same breath.
Story Continues Below Ad ↓

Tuchman's report featured three sound bites from People Magazine's Mike Fleeman, who also contributed to the confusion by referring to "he" [Bono] having a procedure normally associated with women:

    TUCHMAN (voice-over): Today, his name is Chaz Bono, but back then, she was Chastity Bono: not just her parents' sweetheart, but an American sweetheart....

    FLEEMAN: Chaz has given very little specific information about the actual procedure. We know that he's had a mastectomy. We know that he's been taking the proper hormones, know that he had a hysterectomy for unrelated reasons in the past, know that he's living completely as a man, know that he started shaving for the first time.

At this time of year, the sun does not rise at all this far north of the Arctic Circle. But Karen Margrethe Kuvaas says she has not been able to sleep well for days.

What is keeping her awake are the far-reaching ripple effects of the troubled housing market in sunny Florida, California and other parts of the United States.

Ms. Kuvaas is the mayor of Narvik, a remote seaport where the season’s perpetual gloom deepened even further in recent days after news that the town — along with three other Norwegian municipalities — had lost about $64 million, and potentially much more, in complex securities investments that went sour.

“I think about it every minute,” Ms. Kuvaas, 60, said in an interview, her manner polite but harried. “Because of this, we can’t focus on things that matter, like schools or care for the elderly.”

Norway’s unlucky towns are the latest victims — and perhaps the least likely ones so far — of the credit crisis that began last summer in the American subprime mortgage market and has spread to the farthest reaches of the world, causing untold losses and sowing fears about the global economy.

Where all the bad debt ended up remains something of a mystery, but to those hit by the collateral damage, it hardly matters.
Howell Raines lost his executive editor’s job at The New York Times for promoting the career of Jayson Blair, a black drug addict and fantasist who invented entire stories describing the hills of West Virginia from a saloon down the street in New York. But somehow Raines still imagines himself a media bigfoot who can pronounce on the State of Journalism, a one-man Pulitzer Prize panel. This is a little like a White House chef who poisoned an entire state-dinner crowd mounting a soapbox to lecture that the new chefs can’t be trusted.

Of course, that soapbox must be provided first. So who would give this naked man a fig leaf of respectability? The Washington Post would.

The Posties awarded Raines their marquee venue – the Sunday Outlook section -- to denounce Fox News Channel and its owner Rupert Murdoch. Announcing this was tugging at his "professional conscience" (thus suggesting he has one), Raines demanded to know "Why can't American journalists steeped in the traditional values of their profession be loud and candid about the fact that Murdoch does not belong to our team?"

Perfectly timed for the week President Barack Obama is pushing the House to vote on ObamaCare, on tonight’s (Tuesday) episode of CBS’s The Good Wife, set at a Chicago law firm, the lawyers “battle a health insurance company that refuses to pay for urgent in-utero surgery.” The CBS.com plug for the March 16 episode: “In an emergency courtroom set up in a hospital, Alicia and Will battle Patti Nyholm and an insurance company that refuses to pay for life-saving in-utero surgery.”

The last time I critiqued The Good Wife (“CBS Drama Showcases Blank Book that Mocks Palin as Empty-Headed Dunce”), NewsReal blog’s David Forsmark contended the program “is both politically and (more importantly) dramatically complex” and deserves credit for showcasing liberal hypocrisy.

So, I’ll hold out hope this episode will deliver more than just simplistic vilification of an insurance company and might, given the plot involves “in-utero surgery,” also forward pro-life perspectives. Watch and see.

Halloween was so fun. Camden was Wolverine, AJ was a witch, Dilyn was a skeleton, and Austin and me went as the Beauty and the Beast. Guess who was who? lol. We started out going to bri's where she made the most amazing assortment of soups and the cutes little bread soup bowls that looked like pumpkins. Don and Vicci and Maretta and Madison. It was a lot of fun. we did a bit of trick or treating with Bridger, and Madison and then we went up to our neighborhood and went around the block, Camden and Aj about two houses were needing to go potty but they didn't want to leave their goal of getting candy so they did the potty dance as they waited at each door! haha! I tried to get a video on my phone but it was getting too dark and the people always opened the door right before i got it going... but it was dang funny! after we got home I hurried and got the kids bathed and Camden asked to hand out candy I think he was more excited about handing out candy than going to get candy! Camden would go look out the blinds and start hollering that the kids were coming then he'd run and grab the candy bowl and stand in front of the door.... after about 5 seconds he would set the bowl down and run back to the blinds and peek out to see where the kids were at.... then run back to the door stand infront of the front door and again wait till they did the door bell! it was quite entertaining! at one point we got some "bigger kids" and Aj looks at them and says your a "big kid" haha! the boys started laughing and he said "yup" it was a good night and lots of fun!
California Dreamin turned out to be another California nightmare for Elliott Sadler and his 19 team. The buzz words were already flowing in pre-race and qualifying quotes, almost in an eerie foreshadowing of the Sunday to come.“We have a lot of effort put into our front clips, front geometry, trying to get the front tires to work as efficient as we can. Some owners may be thinking its body, motors, rear clips, center cage….there are many things that you can work on. Right now we’re really working on our front clips area, bump stop and front geometry stuff. As a team, we think that’s where we need to be better. Right now, that’s where the emphasis has been with winter testing so far.”Listening via the greatness of PitCommand, it was pretty clear from the start that Sadler was not happy but it goes further than that.Lap 5 caution (rain)Sadler after five (really 4) short laps tells CC Kevin Buskirk that there is a problem with the front end by announcing that the 19 car is ‘a little snug in the middle and a 
little snug back in the gas….and that the splitter seemed to be dragging a bit’, in the corners. After a small exchange that the 19 team finally figured out that the radios used need the ‘big antenna’ in order for Sadler to hear them (maybe the Best Buy Geek Squad should assist) another ‘track position’ pit strategy move instead of making an honest attempt to ‘fix’ an ill handling car, 2 tires and a half pound out of the right rear was the pit call. The 19 entered the pits running 25th, and took the green flag running 21st.Side note: This caution lasted over 15 laps and it was during this caution that Sadler was asking for the dreaded TRACKBAR change in order to give him some more ‘forward bite’. Since the last pit stop, no green flag laps had been run, and Sadler is already ‘complaining’ about the car. Not that there is anything wrong with this, except for the ‘strategy’ 2 tire stop laps before. Why not simply make the changes, take four tires, lose a few positions , in the name of making the car better in  he long run? But I have been a broken record about this for almost a decade.Lap 35 scanner chat:Sadler tells Buskirk that the 19 is ‘still dragging the splitter on entry’, and is a ‘little free off’. The 19 car is running 26th at this time.Lap 41 caution (rain): Sadler reinforces that the ‘splitter is still dragging too much on entry’ He goes a bit more in depth for his CC with ‘Front end is trying to work, its better than yesterday.’ And lastly again states he wants ‘a little more forward bite on exit’. Buskirk quickly and commandly tells the 19 team to go up on all 4 tire pressures and to add a ‘packer’. (not sure which tire the bump stop was added to though). Sadler added that he didn’t think it would need much, maybe a ‘1/16th’, not much more. The 19 enter the pits running 27th, and took the field running 39th. It was then decided after a nice suggestion by Brett Griffin that it might be a good idea to ‘top off’ because there were only two cars running behind the 19. After topping off, the 19 takes the green flag running 40th.
When Valve confirmed Mac support for Steam last week, I emailed the Joystiq team with the following claim: "this is arguably the biggest gaming news on Mac OS ever." It seems Valve shares the sentiment, as the company's John Cook – director of Steam development at Valve – calls it "the biggest event in Steam's history." He also answered some more of our questions via email, so read on!


Joystiq: Just to clarify, Steam users with games already purchased on Windows and that have Mac versions available will have those Mac versions accessible to them immediately in Steam, for no extra charge?

John Cook: This is supported by "Steam Play." We are using this feature to provide cross-platform access to all Valve games to those who already own the PC version. We hope other developers and publishers will use it in the same way.


Some blogs have reported that Valve "hates the Mac" – From Gabe: "So, they seem to think that they want to do gaming, but there's never any follow through on any of the things they say they're going to do. That makes it hard to be excited about doing games for their platforms." So, as a followup, was Apple involved in this endeavor at all? Did they provide any programming resources or platform-level assistance?

First, the statement that Gabe hates the Mac is erroneous. In fact, he worked on a 6Mhz Lisa running a Mac emulator in his first post-college job and is involved in the current Mac work on a daily basis. As for Apple, yes -- we've been working with them on this project and we're looking forward to expanding that relationship as we launch Steam for the Mac.
On Tuesday's Situation Room, CNN's Jack Cafferty returned to targeting Nancy Pelosi, this time for endorsing the controversial "Slaughter Solution" to passing ObamaCare through the House of Representatives without a vote. Cafferty labeled the proposal "beyond sleazy," and later flatly remarked, "This reeks!" The commentator even gave some rare kudos to House Republicans [audio clips from the segment available here].

Cafferty devoted his 5 pm Eastern hour commentary to Pelosi's support for the "deem and pass" procedural maneuver that Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter submitted as a possible way of getting the Senate version of health care "reform" passed through the House. He wasted little time in expressing his amazement at the move: "Just when you think you've seen it all in Washington, along comes something like this. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may try to pass the controversial health care reform bill without making members vote on it- simply unbelievable."

Later, after using his "beyond sleazy" label, Cafferty ripped into the House Speaker and her Democratic colleagues, and commended their Republican opponents for speaking out against the so-called Slaughter Solution: "Pelosi says of this process- quote, 'I like it, because people don't have to vote on the Senate bill,' unquote. In Nancy Pelosi's world, accountability is a dirty word....This tactic has been used in the past, but never- never for something as big and important as the $900 billion health care reform bill- never. Republicans are jumping all over this, rightfully so. They're painting it as a way for Democrats to avoid taking responsibility, which is exactly what it is. Some even suggest it's unconstitutional."

Near the end of the segment, anchor Wolf Blitzer remarked, "We're earning a lot about reconciliation, about 'deeming' bills passed into law. We're getting a little civics lesson out there, aren't we, Jack?" The CNN commentator replied, "We're learning a lot more about lack of political guts." When Blitzer retorted that "that's been around for a while," Cafferty bluntly replied, "Not quite in this obnoxious form or noxious form. This reeks!"

Taylor Harris, a black University of Virginia graduate now studying writing at Johns Hopkins, had an excellent article (“Racial pawns in the battle for same-sex marriage”) in the Washington Post recently.

“All too often,” she begins, white liberal classmates at the University of Virginia would ask, “Shouldn’t blacks, more than any other group, support gay rights?” She continues:

    I never understood my classmates’ need to align the historical struggles of blacks with those of homosexuals and then push their quadratic equation of oppression on me. Was not one point of Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, a classic text for college seminars, that blacks deserve an existence free from an assigned role? That they should not be pawns in any social movement? And even if they hadn’t read the book, wasn’t it clear that stereotypical assumptions based on race are regressive?

On that last point, it’s certainly not clear to everyone. What would there be to “diversity,” after all, without the assumption that blacks are one and all “different” enough to provide it to others? For the purposes of “diversity,” in short, blacks are fungible: because they are all “different,” they are all the same. But let’s leave “diversity” aside for now and return to the issue of blacks and gays.

“Hearing that from my white peers was one thing,” Ms. Harris continued,

    [b]ut last month, one of our greatest civil rights leaders also sang the same cacophonous tune in an attempt to peg African Americans’ morals and opinions to our socio-historical identities.
Joe Sheehan over at Basketball Prospectus is back aboard a favorite old hobbyhorse  of his — the NCAA selection committee's habit of matching up non-BCS schools in the first round — and damned if he doesn't have a point.

This year, we have UNLV-Northern Iowa, Butler-UTEP, Richmond-St. Mary's, Temple-Cornell. That's not an inordinate number of mid-major vs. mid-major pairings; if you were to randomly generate a bracket, as Kevin Pelton did, you'd get four or five such games. But here's Sheehan:

    The thing is, it's *not* a random process. They're sitting down, doing a bracket and shoving these teams together, while also giving us Cal/Louisville and Clemson/Missouri. I stand by the idea that this is intentional, and has increased since the Wichita State/George Mason regional semi in '06. They simply don't want more than one, maybe two widely spaced Cinderellas getting to that second weekend.

    Running at this from a different direction, follow the money. Conferences get shares based on how far their teams advance in the tournament. It's best for the dominant conferences if the smaller ones are capped in how many shares they can get.

    [...]

    It's bad for the tournament and for the game. Cornell, UTEP, St. Mary's, UNI...these teams can't get games against BCS schools in the regular season short of playing at their place, and sometimes not even then. The tournament should provide some of that opportunity, and it's aggressively not doing so, essentially protecting the scheduling practices of BCS schools by not potentially exposing them to quality lower-conference teams in the tournament.

There's a case to be made that just about any first-round matchup of mid-major teams is both somewhere south of ideal — fans don't want Cinderella vs. Cinderella — and easily avoided. That the selection committee feels otherwise, Sheehan argues, isn't so much a wicked conspiracy as it is the inevitably perverted outcome of letting people with skin in the game decide who gets to play whom and when. I'll buy that. For all the talk of "peeling the onion" and all the ludicrously pained efforts at objectivity (a reliance on that worthless bit of bottom-dealing known as the RPI, for instance), the selection process is in reality little more than an exercise in looking at the big blinking neon arrows all around you and doing exactly as they say.
Back during the 2008 presidential campaign, then-Sen. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for vice president said it was "patriotic" for people to pay more taxes, in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America." But what if you don't have to pay more taxes legally?

Biden's reasoning was simplistic - that we all need to "jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut." But according to CNBC's Jim Cramer, based on legal precedence, the Internal Revenue Service encourages people to pay as little tax as possible, as long as it is within the boundaries of the seemingly endless U.S. tax code.

"The government has made it very clear in a series of tax rulings since the income tax started - and I learned this at law school - that it is actually well within your patriotic right to try and pay as little tax legally," Cramer said on CNBC's March 12 "Street Signs." "See, tax avoidance is actually part of the IRS - says listen tax avoidance, you can do it. Tax evasion is against the law. Tax avoidance, the IRS has always said listen you have every right to try and have tax avoidance. And believe me, I'm going to take advantage of it."

Who would have ever thought that "a bike" would bring me onto such a positive & life changing path?

On 01 January 1994, I realized that there was more to life than: guzzling an expensive bottle of Robert Mondavi Chardonnay, being the belle of the ball, speaking of what others need to work on, and/or sitting daily on the same coach (in self pity). So, I bought a 10 year old Bianchi Road Bike. And I began a 6-month intense cycling training for a cycling event called the California AIDS Ride #2.

In May of 1994, I left San Francisco with $3.00 in my pocket, no idea of how I was going to return, a questionable bike, the fear of failure, and began to cycle (along with 1500 other cyclist) toward West Hollywood. Seven days, 575 miles later, I arrived in West Hollywood. At which point, I realized it is possible to step outside of your normal routine. I realized it is possible to empower yourself while assisting others. I realized that I wasn't alone in my ideas of creating a better world. And I realized that miracles could occur (after all, I made it back home with $3.00 in my pocket).
Facebook’s f8 conference  is shaping up to have quite a few improvements in store for developers, and we think we’ve come across another one: a change to Facebook’s data retention policy. Yesterday, Facebook employee Monica Keller (who left MySpace to join  the company last month), took part in a conversation on Twitter that seemed to indicate that developers may no longer have to delete user data. The possible change came to light after Gnip CEO Eric Marcoullier gently chided Keller about developers being unable to store any user data, to which she responded, “come to f8!”.

Since that tweet, we’ve heard further whispers about a change to Facebook’s 24 hour policy retention, and that Facebook is already briefing developers on the upcoming changes.
Britain's small businesses are being offered free domain names and website hosting in a bid to get every plumber, window cleaner and green-grocer online.
Up to 1.5 million of the UK's sole traders and micro-business owners don't have a web presence at the moment. The British government wants to do something about this, and they've teamed up with Google and BT to solve what they perceive to be a problem.
The result is an initiative called Getting British Business Online which has the bold ambition of getting 100,000 commercial websites running by the end of 2010. The core of the program is the GBBO 'wizard' that makes it easy for a business owner to create a site in about 15 minutes. There are plans for PayPal to add an e-commerce platform in the next couple of months.
Subscribers to this free service get their own choice of a .co.uk domain name and two years of free hosting. The pages are built with Google sites, while BT offers free telephone support to allow users to "create an effective online presence."  In addition, the UK has launched a qualification called, ITQ for Doing Business Online, which is aimed at helping businesses get the most from their website, thus allowing them to become more competitive.
According to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Lord Mandelson: "Encouraging more businesses to seize the opportunities the internet offers is particularly important now that the economy is growing again."
It remains to be seen whether Britain's army of offline entrepreneurs are tempted to start promoting their wares online through this offer of a free website.
Email messages obtained by the Competitive Enterprise Institute via a Freedom of Information Act request reveal that the climate dataset of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) was considered — by the top climate scientists within NASA itself — to be inferior to the data maintained by the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU).

The NASA scientists also felt that NASA GISS data was inferior to the National Climate Data Center Global Historical Climate Network (NCDC GHCN) database.

These emails, obtained by Christopher Horner, also show that the NASA GISS dataset was not independent of CRU data.

Further, all of this information regarding the accuracy and independence of NASA GISS data was directly communicated to a reporter from USA Today in August 2007.

The reporter never published it.

When Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana announced last week he wasn’t running for re-election, he didn’t state what may have seemed obvious. He couldn’t say he wanted to avoid the embarrassment of losing, or that he worried he’d never achieve national office if that happened. Instead, he launched into a lecture about what was wrong with everyone else. The government is "dysfunctional" with "brain-dead partisanship."

It’s "Groundhog Day." This scenario repeats itself every time the Democrats take control.

Bayh’s bleats hardened quickly into the media’s conventional wisdom. Why can’t the politicians hold hands in a Kumbaya circle and get "something" done? Translation: when Obama and a Democrat-dominated Congress can’t nationalize the health-care system and force everyone to drive a Prius, suddenly government is "dysfunctional." When gridlock is holding up the liberals’ agenda, Washington should know "the people" sent them to pass massive ultraliberal bills.

These media mathematicians clearly have thrown their polling calculators out the window. When Newsweek recently asked independents if they supported the Democrat health proposals, 26 percent were in favor, and 62 percent were opposed. But the "wisdom" in town says Democrats must pass these health bills or get crushed in November. Now who can’t seem to acknowledge, to borrow from Stephen Colbert, that "reality has a conservative bias"?

Reality tells you many Democrats are political toast, thanks to ObamaCare. Hence, bye-bye Bayh. But our journalists put on their choir robes and continue to sing the sad song in unison: Why do we have a "Broken Government"? CNN actually launched an entire series of reports with that title.

Maybe Thomson Reuters was feeling nostalgic about the flurry of negative attention that both the New York Times and the Washington Post got last year when they came out with policies on the use of social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook. For whatever reason, the wire service recently issued new guidelines for its staff, and they suffer from many of the same problems that both the NYT and WaPo policies did. All of these flaws boil down to one thing: A desire to control something that fundamentally can’t be controlled, and a fear of what happens when that control is lost. Without even bothering to enumerate the positive aspects of social media use, the policy starts in with the warnings right away:

    We want to encourage you to use social media approaches in your journalism but we also need to make sure that you are fully aware of the risks — especially those that threaten our hard-earned reputation for independence and freedom from bias or our brand.

The risks, of course, are everywhere — someone might say something embarrassing, or post a tweet that others could twist to disparage Reuters:

    The advent of social media does not change your relationship with the company that employs you — do not use social media to embarrass or disparage Thomson Reuters. Our company’s brands are important; so, too, is your personal brand. Think carefully about how what you do reflects upon you as a professional and upon us as an employer of professionals.
Recently Presidential Special Advisor David Axelrod has been painted as a beleaguered figure, upset at the world he sees around him. Today he told the Republicans to "make my day" and the Israelis a new policy announcement was an "insult."

Axelrod and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs were doing the rounds on the Sunday talk shows to talk about healthcare reform, among other topics. Gibbs told Fox News Sunday that Democrats would have enough votes to pass the bill in the next week or so and that soon we wouldn't be "talking about health care as a proposal, but as the law of the land."

Tom Brokaw, on Meet the Press, asked David Axelrod about the political cost of that reform for upcoming elections. Axelrod leapt up on the table, and began savagely beating him (metaphorically):

    If the Republican Party wants to go out and say to that child who now has insurance or say to that small business that will get tax credits this year if he signs the bill to help their employees get health care. If they want to say to them, "You know what? We're actually gonna take that away from you. We don't think that's such a good idea." I say, let's have that fight. Make my day. I'm ready to have that. And every member of Congress ought to be willing to have that debate as well.

Enough ass-kicking work for one day? Not for fuck-you-Axelrod. Israel have potentially torpedoed delicate negotiations with Palestine by announcing a plan to build 1600 new homes in Jerusalem. He told ABC's This Week that the move was both an "affront" and an "insult."
We see this when He demands of us the impossible. Jesus told people to "go and sin no more." (Jn. 5:14, 8:11) Not, go and sin less. Sin no more. Impossible. "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church." (Eph. 5:25) "Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect." (Matt. 5:48) God asks of us the impossible, we fail, we sin - we separate from God because we can't do the impossible. 

But God can. All things, it says in Matthew 19 when speaking of salvation (something impossible for us to achieve on our own), are possible with God.

The Bible starts with this very thing: In the beginning God created. God was there when time began and created. How? By the impossible task of creation through speaking. I can't get my daughters to turn off the lights in their room with my words, but God said, "let there be light." AND THERE WAS LIGHT! Not just a 50w bulb here; there was LIGHT. From His voice! The Psalmist says God breathed out stars and gathers the waters of the seas into jars. (Ps. 33:6-7) And this is just the start. God is so big he deals in the realm of the impossible.

And so it's no surprise that Christmas is an impossible night. Let's turn to John 1, starting in verse 10:

He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. 

The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

Impossibly, God the creator entered into His creation at Christmas (well, technically, at Jesus' conception.) The world was made through him (Jesus), and He became flesh and made his dwelling among us. As our pastor, Jason, reminded us this morning [12/20 sermon], God did not just drop in for a visit. He was born into our world. He became one of us. God became a man: impossible. He was born to a virgin. Impossible. He came that we might be saved. Impossible.

Impossible for man, but with God all things are possible. Angels appeared to shepherds. Angels appeared to Mary & Joseph. Sages from far away read Jesus' birth in the stars. The creator God of the universe who is big enough to breathe out stars became a baby, wrapped in laid in the humblest of mangers. Proclaimed by angels, worshipped by shepherds and foreigners - Jesus entered His creation, became Immanuel: God with us. He made it possible for us to become born again, something which again is impossible - without God. A little baby displayed the glory of God. The smallest of infants demonstrated, through His impossible birth and through the bigness of who this baby was, the immensity of God's grace, His mercy, His love.

This is why Christmas is a reason to worship, to celebrate, to be in awe of this GREAT BIG GOD who came for us who deals in the (what is for us) impossible in impossible ways – that’s the message of Christmas and it’s what we rejoice in at Christmas.
It's been something of a long road to this point (beginning with the company being founded by some laid off OpenMoko employees), but Qi Hardware's ultra-compact, open source Ben NanoNote (actually, 本 NanoNote) is now shipping for just $99. That will get you a bare bones device that can simply be used as a Linux-based "handheld laptop" out of the box or, as the company hopes, be turned into anything from a PMP to an offline Wikipedia device. Something along those lines would seem to be the most practical, considering the device only has a 3-inch 320 x 240 display, along with some similarly basic specs including a 336 MHz XBurst Jz4720 CPU, 32MB of RAM, 2GB of flash storage, and a microSD card slot for expansion. Head on past the break for a look under the lid.
Some days later, Alessandro shared this interesting post about the several versions of Flash available on Android.It's now clear that a new Flash Lite is coming 'soon'.
What is it (apart to support AS3, alleluia) ? For which platform ? Available throught CS4 or CS5 
Like I reported previously, it's strange how Adobe isn't sharing the information on FLite 4.0...Perhaps to avoid the confusion with FP10.1 ?
I only hope one thing : to see FL4 (and FP10.1) working on Android emulator!
Actually, apart an old S60 SDK which let you play FL1.1, I never found an emulator (nokia, se, android,...) able to play FL files
and no, unfortunatly, the HTC Desire ROM doesn't work on Android emulator, since it's not for the right ARM processor :(
With despair gripping New York Democrats over ethical scandals claiming Governor David Patterson, Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY), and Rep. Eric Massa (D-NY), New York’s Attorney General Andrew Cuomo cuts a heroic figure as the presumptive heir to the governorship.

But catching up with Cuomo is his relationship with the mortgage meltdown that nearly destroyed the American economy. Appointed by Bill Clinton as secretary of the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Andrew Cuomo has been called “the father of the subprime crisis” for the policies he orchestrated.

It was Cuomo’s directives that mandated HUD to vastly increase the amount of risky home loans bought by quasi-governmental housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now, Cuomo may be haunted by his tenure as HUD secretary, where he planted the seeds for the nation’s housing collapse.

Though America’s financial fortunes suffered after Cuomo’s time at HUD, his own personal fortune soared. The bulk of this financial “windfall” came courtesy of Andrew Farkas, the billionaire real estate developer who helped Cuomo amass his wealth as a business partner and campaign fundraiser. Farkas — now Cuomo’s financial chairman as he circles the governorship — has personally given Cuomo at least $1.8 million in cash.
riginally posted this a couple weeks ago after the link was forwarded to me, but rewrote my thoughts after seeing it a few times.

I'll still watch it again. A few times are not enough for me. Each time you watch you'll see another inspiring moment. Sometimes I just want to quit work and practice, so I can join the fun.

(Many of my best articles start with ideas from readers like you, so please keep sending me your thoughts!!!)

This documentary is not new, but totally worth your time.



It's interesting watching these young ballet dancers grow into Flamenco dancers. The clapping exercises, the timing, and the process they go through are amazing. Few of us could be that good without their background, but it's still worth checking out even if you're a casual dancer.

It's very inspirational. They start so "simple" and build!

The passion from the instructors is obvious. They clearly know the history and story behind the music and movements. They combine amazing technique with an understanding of the feel, providing depth behind the movements.

You have to love the "circle" concept (around 26 minutes), where individuals take a turn dancing solo while everybody else provides the rhythm foundation and support. Hip-hop dancers do this all the time, but obviously it's been around a few centuries before they were born. (As they say, little is truly new. Most great artists build on the shoulders of the giants before them...)

Obviously this passion is way beyond what most of us will do social dancing. When you see the results from lots of hard work it may inspire you to work a little harder so you can join the fun too.

Great dance has it's moments of intense work. When it all comes together in the end it's a beautiful, inspiring, sensual experience.It's hard not to smile and feel good watching them perform.

Special thinks to Valentine Doran for turning me on to this clip.

Let me know what you think!

In sports, everyone is a winner—some people just win better than others. Like Michael David Barrett, Erin Andrews's peeper, who was sentenced yesterday to two-and-a-half years in prison and life as another triple-named American villain.

Maybe some J.D. out there (or, that failing, an ESPN.com commenter) can explain this to me. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real said the 30 months was the maximum he could've imposed, though a quick glance at the federal sentencing table would suggest that Barrett's term actually falls toward the low end. (Stalking carries a base offense level of 18, i.e. 27-33 months, though the fact that Barrett chased Andrews all across the Marriotts of America probably should've taken it up a couple of ticks). In any case, Andrews is not pleased:

    "I'm at the angry stage right now," the ESPN reporter and upcoming contestant on ABC's "Dancing With the Stars" said outside court.

    "I'm mad. Thirty months is not enough."

    [...]

    She blasted Barrett for claiming he should get leniency because he's paying for his guilty plea with public humiliation and spoke searingly in court about her own fear and suffering.

    "Let's talk about public humiliation, Mr. Barrett," Andrews said. "I'm living public humiliation. The picture on the Internet is mine, it's not his."
CNN received two awards on March 13 from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) during its annual GLAAD Media Awards. The American Morning program received the "outstanding TV journalism segment" award for an interview of a child who refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance until homosexuals have "equal rights," while Joy Behar received their "excellence in media" award for her HLN program.

The homosexual activist organization's press release on the awards revealed that "CNN's American Morning producer Beth Marengo and Will Phillips accepted for the Outstanding TV Journalism Segment, 'Why Will Won't Pledge Allegiance' which featured Phillips and his father. In a rousing speech that elicited a standing ovation, 11-year-old Phillips said: 'I know there are certain political restraints that make action difficult, however lack of equality for some is lack of equality for all and I think its time for us all to get equal.'"

Anchor John Roberts interviewed Phillips and his father on the November 16, 2009 edition of American Morning. As NewsBuster Noel Sheppard pointed out, the two were given much better treatment than tea party protesters were given earlier in 2009.

Behar received her "excellence" award from NBC Today show anchor Meredith Vieira. The GLAAD press released trumpeted how the HLN host "has shown a strong commitment to educating the public about the lives of gay and transgender people." The TVNewser blog on March 14 reported Behar's beyond positive reaction to the recognition: "I'd rather have that than the Oscar...It shows that people who struggle in this society with public image and being behind the eight ball with their rights, they recognize that someone like me who has the microphone can support them."
Hear ye, hear ye! I doth proclaim myself a full-fledged (or as close as I can be) adult. I’ve schooled. I’ve worked. I’ve lived. I’ve toiled. I am a fully-fledged adult. I’ve taken on responsibility. I’ve buckled down when the times required me to. I’ve been the epitome of Emily Post’s great-great-grandchild. Yes, I am a full-fledged adult. I may now proceed onto bigger and better things. I am an adult who is comfortable in their own Chupa Chups skin. I’m as honest as can be. I feel really guilty lying to people, but I’m not one to shy away from a little white lie; you know, like the few times a homeless person comes up to you and asks you for change and you say you don’t have any. I mean don’t get me wrong. I give up my change if I have it. However, if I’m not in the best financial situations, I’m most certainly not going to give up my laundry money quarter to a stranger who’s probably making good on loose change. If I can’t afford to give coins, I do my best to offer whatever food I may have. (Haven’t you noticed that although they say they want something to eat, they’d rather get the cash instead?) So, yes, I am a fully-fledged adult. I practice good hygiene. In the winter, I shower, floss, brush, and rinse at least twice a day; morning and night. When summer time arrives, it’s at least three times. I commit to nourishing my body with healthy foods. I’ve just taught myself to eat celery. I’m not 100% there but I’m a good 40% there. I’ve taught myself to eat spinach, broccoli, bean curd, tofu, etc. Yes, I am a fully-fledged adult. Sadly, as this fully-fledged adult, my metabolism isn’t the best. It’s increasingly slowing down. It’s harder for me to manage my weight. Although I’ve not gained much weight, I’ve also not been able to lose any; mostly because I forget the most important part of the component of weight loss- actually get up off the couch. Sigh. SO to the world: I doth proclaim my adultness. I am one of you. I’ve joined your ranks. I’m a doer and not just a follower. World, that is all. Please continue with your day. Goodbye.
Being busy with a lot of open projects at work and school has made me a bit tired. I get off work and have to go to school. I finish an exam at school and I have to deal with a tight deadline at work. Sometimes, I want to “pause” what’s going on around me and go and walk for couple of hours. I need to get my thoughts organized and defragged. I feel a subtle touch of fear in missing deadlines or missing important tasks. I’m always repeating/reviewing my Todo’s list in an effort to prevent any missed task. I hope I can stretch my mind over all these tasks and get to a level where I can handle
Multi- Multi -tasking .

As Oliver Wendell Holmes puts: A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimension
Does life behind the mouthpiece sometimes feel like there's a camera on the front of your bell, and you're on a high speed bobsled going ninety miles an hour? All the notes are flying by faster than they can be processed. We're on a race desperately trying to maintain control, dropping more notes than we nail. Is this a trumpet or a runaway Toyota? Somebody help!

Remember what Dad did when the family would get lost on vacation trips? He drove faster! Why is it that the harder the passage, the faster we go? Instead of the panic button, we should hit the brakes. With treacherous curves at every turn, cooler heads and slower practice speeds ought to prevail.

Dr. Phil has a two-word remedy for this ailment: SLOW DOWN! Everything improves at slower speeds. Notes can be seen, heard and controlled much better in slow motion. Think paycheck. You only get paid for well-played notes, period. Why not perfect as many notes as you can at your own comfortable tempo? High speeds may be resumed when conditions are safe.

A recent article gave an interesting look into exorcism as practiced within the Roman Catholic Church. According to Father Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican's chief exorcist, the unfortunate sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church is proof that "the Devil is at work inside the Vatican." Astonishingly, Father Amorth indicated that he participated in around 70,000 exorcisms during his 25 years as a Catholic exorcist. For any of you who are counting, that's a claim of approximately 7.5 exorcisms per day, for the last 25 years!

While Father Amorth's description of satanic possession seems quite graphic, from at least one personal experience I can affirm that a good portion of it is fairly accurate. I previously wrote about Satan's power and influence in a related post.

Without delving into the controversial sex abuse scandals or trying to figure out how Father Amorth has time to sleep or eat with his busy exorcist schedule, I'd like to discuss priesthood authority and its connection to rejecting satanic presence. Particularly, is Christ's true priesthood required to command Satan and his subjects? Can the faith of an individual (or the combined faith of those present) be used in an exorcism instead of invoking or wielding the true priesthood authority?

The apostle John once remarked to the Savior that "[the apostles] saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us" (Luke 9:49-50)(emphasis added).

Does this mean that those without Christ's true priesthood authority are able to command and cast out devils as much as one with authority? Commenting on the phrase "he followeth not us," Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote:
"He was not one of the Twelve to whom the express power had been given to cast out devils (Matthew 10:8); he was not one of the inner circle of disciples who traveled, ate, slept, and communed with the Master. Luke has it: 'He followeth not with us'; that is, he is not one of our traveling companions. But from our Lord's reply it is evident that he was a member of the kingdom, a legal administrator who was acting in the authority of the priesthood and the power of faith. Either he was unknown to John who therefore erroneously supposed him to be without authority or else John falsely supposed that the power to cast out devils was limited to the Twelve and did not extend to all faithful priesthood holders. It is quite possible that the one casting out devils was a seventy.
...
"Only righteous men who are members of the Church, who hold the priesthood, and who are keeping the commandments, have power to perform miracles.... Our Lord had many faithful followers who had power by faith to cast out devils" (Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, 1:417)(emphasis added).

To be clear, I do not believe the Catholic Church wields the true priesthood of God. Consistent with LDS theology, I believe Christ's true priesthood was lost to the world at large during the great apostasy. However, I also do not believe that Catholic exorcists, such as Father Amorth are followers of Satan. (See Matt. 12:25-26) Notwithstanding, is it possible that exorcisms can still be effectuated by individuals lacking the priesthood through an exercise and display of faith?

The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that "faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth" (Lectures on Faith, 1:13)(emphasis added). Indeed, it was faith that was invoked to frame the worlds (Heb 11:3), and it is through faith that all created things exist. "[Faith] is the principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all temporal as well as eternal things.... And if the principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in Diety" (Id. at 1:16, 18)(emphasis added).

When the Twelve were unable to cast a devil out of a "lunatick," they queried the Savior on how He was able to finish what they could not. Christ then proceeded to teach them doctrines of faith, not of priesthoods. "Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting" (Matt. 17:20-21)(emphasis added). Thus, since prayer and fasting doesn't have any effect on whether one possesses the priesthood but instead affects one's level of faith, it appears that exorcism relies more on the principle of faith than on one's authority.

Admittedly, I have not taken part in or seen a Catholic exorcism (apart from what Hollywood concocts). I have, however, taken part in a handful of LDS exorcisms and can attest that one's faith plays an enormous role. Still, I am not certain of the extent that God's priesthood plays in such instances. Is the pristhood required simply to keep order? Yet, if an individual lacks the priesthood but has sufficient faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, can that individual command evil in His name? And, if that is the case, does Father Amorth truly exorcise evil spirits during his claimed frequent encounters?
"Each time Andrew Sullivan writes negatively about Israel (which is to say, almost every day), my e-mail in-box becomes flooded with pleas that I respond. Sometimes I don't, because I have other, better things, to do. But last week, after Andrew published an egregious and tendentious map meant to deny Jewish claims to virtually any of the land of Israel, I did respond, helped along by about 130 e-mails from readers who were as upset as I was that the Atlantic Magazine's website featured such crude agitprop. I responded quickly, and angrily (even making a mistake in accusing Andrew of not attributing the map. He did, to the anti-Israel academic Juan Cole.) Then, of course, Andrew responded quickly and angrily, and I spent a good deal of time thinking of ways to respond to his response to my response. And then I realized that this is not how I want to spend my life.

Yes, it's upsetting that Andrew Sullivan, a man of obvious intellectual gifts (and someone for whom I retain great personal fondness), has become an anti-Israel propagandist. But it's not my job to counter everything he says. He's not particularly interested in hearing fact-based arguments that undermine whatever argument he happens to be making, in any case. And even if he did care, it's not in the best interests of The Atlantic, or of my journalism, or my sanity, to spend my time worrying about Andrew's ever-shifting views on the Middle East.

So I'm unilaterally disengaging from this struggle. I pray, of course, that Andrew comes to see that his oversimplification of Middle East history and politics has caused real damage to real people, but it's time for someone else to argue with him.

There is another benefit to disengagement. As Goldblog readers know, I'm deeply distressed by many currents in Israeli society and politics, the continuing, disproportionate power of the settlement movement being chief among my concerns. But I find myself hesitant to criticize Israel these days because my words are inevitably used by people who don't have Israel's best interests, or the best interests of American Jews, at heart.  So I want to find a new way to write about these issues. The new way, obviously, is the old way. The best use of my time, I think, would be to return to what I originally was meant to do when I joined The Atlantic a couple of years ago, which is to write reported, carefully considered, fact-checked and closely-edited articles about the issues that interest me. In other words, don't expect to see too much on Goldblog about this set of issues, generally. I appreciate all of your letters (except those that begin ""Dear Zionist Douchebag,"" or, ""Dear Self-Hating Jewboy Douchebag""), and I'll figure out, as I go forward, what to do with this blog, but I don't think that writing in anger is good for anyone. So here's hoping that the Goldblog Unilateral Disengagement Plan goes better than the Gaza Disengagement Plan."
Note:  My apologies for the prior version of this post.  I wrote it too quickly and did not give it a good proof reading.

I read an article the other day by Arthur Langer about how IT can survive the current economic recession.  I was struck by the following piece of advice:

“Move more IT expenses into business units.  This keeps all the dollars from being in one large IT budget.  It also allows business units to defend their requests for extra spending.”

I read this recommendation a few times.  Langer’s other advice, shown below, makes sense.  The points below are sound.

    * Show why investments need to precede—not lag—the recovery.  Give historical proof that this method works and timelines that will better position the business to compete.
    * Ask for smaller amounts of investments, allowing the business to be somewhat cautious should economic trends not improve.
    * Don’t expect the budget you might ultimately need, but rather the dollars that will allow you to deliver some portion of the overall product strategy.
    * Commit to product reviews, perhaps every 90 days.  This way, executives can feel that they can change priorities if and when necessary.

The idea of moving (hiding) IT expenses in the business unit to make them small enough not to be noticed seems out of place in this list.
This is a longer version of a story that will appear in the Sunday Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times and also on the cover of Brand X.

Bryan Singer and Lauren Shuler Donner

Through the years, comic-book films took audiences to all the predictable places, including the grim streets of Gotham City and the doomed spires of planet Krypton, but, a decade ago, a new type of comic-book film had the audacity to set its opening sequence in a truly unexpected place -- the gates of Auschwitz, where Jewish families were bring marched through mud on their way to death and despair.

From those first moments, "X-Men" set itself apart from the entire Hollywood history of comic-book adaptations and marked the beginning of this current era of fanboy cinema, which has dominated the box office and elevated San Diego's Comic-Con International into something resembling a Cannes for capes.

"The opening, it really was a declaration of intent," producer Lauren Shuler Donner said of that sequence, which showed a terrified young boy exhibiting mutant powers as his family was separated by German guards. "It said to the audience this is a serious film, grounded in the realistic and the historic and somewhat dark. It was so smart. And it was all totally Bryan."

That would be Bryan Singer, the director of "X-Men" and its first sequel, who was sitting next to Shuler Donner in her office on a recent afternoon. The pair both had big smiles on their faces -- they had been reunited by an invitation to reminisce about the legacy of the July 2000 release, which they were happy to do, but the conversation kept veering into giddy plans for the future. Singer is returning to the "X-Men" universe, it's clear now, for a project called "X-Men: First Class"; it's all just a matter of timing.
Men: Want to build a more masculine face and get masculine features? Then try face exercises for men!

In today's society there are many men that apparently have no idea that they can build a masculine face using face exercises for men! There are plenty of face and neck exercises that can provide men some truly effective ways for helping to sculpt, tone and define all of your facial features. What's more is that these face exercises you can sculpt a chiseled jawline and even help to define and enhance your cheekbones in only a matter of weeks!

You should try to think of face exercises in the same manner that body builders use bodybuilding techniques to help build practically any part of their bodies. I mean,there are over 56 muscles in the face. If you don't think that you can build your facial muscles, then you are seriously mistaken!

Because the very same principles used in bodybuilding are also used in facial exercises. When used routinely, here's what you can expect from face exercises for men:

*You can help to enhance your jawline! Face and neck exercises have been proven to help a man create a chiseled jawline through jawline exercises.

*You can even help to define your chin area. You can help the chin to get more developed through proper exercises.

*You can help to reduce a double chin. This one benefit alone had so many men jump on the men's facial exercise bandwagon!

*You can help to eliminate bags under the eyes. Yes, you can even help to get rid of fatigue from under the eyes. This is the same type of fatigue that makes a man look much older than he actually is. This type of nagging condition can actually be decreased greatly by using proper facial exercise techniques!

Here are some tips you can try right NOW to help you get more masculine facial features right away!

1. Start by taking your middle finger and placing it on your chin.

2. Next, proceed to put your lips over both your upper and your lower teeth.

3. Then you just want to slightly open your mouth about half way, keeping it there in this position for about 20 to 40 seconds on each rep. Be sure to hold it in a strong hold, really feeling your jawline beginning to form more tightly.

4. That's it!

This exercises will not only help you to achieve a more masculine,chiseled jawline, but it will also help you to develop and build a more masculine looking face!

I mean, you can even help to enhance your cheekbones greatly by performing these isometric facial exercises for men. This is great news for any man that wants to help better himself and ultimately wants to help himself look better.
A Northwest Side man listed as a potential threat to judges tried to enter the Daley Center with four hunting knives he had just purchased, according to the Cook County sheriff's office.

Kevin J. Long, 48, of the 4500 block of North Milwaukee Avenue, walked into the building Tuesday afternoon and passed through a metal detector while his bag was sent through an X-ray machine.

A Cook County sheriff's deputy saw images of several knives in Long's briefcase. When asked what was inside, Long allegedly said it was "just papers," according to a news release from the sheriff's office.

Long allegedly told investigators he had come to the Daley Center to visit the law library and had forgotten about the knives, which he said he bought earlier in the day as a gift for his brother-in-law. He was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, both of which are felonies.

Long has been on parole since November after serving 15 months in prison for telling a witness in a civil case that he would kill the witness's child. His name also is on a list developed by the U.S. Marshals Service and the Cook County sheriff's department naming individuals who may pose a threat to judges or court officials.

Long also has been arrested 18 times since 2000 for various incidents, including being caught in a judge's chambers and public indecency.

Cook County Circuit Judge Donald Panarese set bail at $350,000 on Wednesday, according to Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's office.

He was denied bail on the parole violation, and Panarese barred him from entering any Cook County courthouse unless he was required to be there and unless he was accompanied to and from the courtroom by a sheriff's deputy, Simonton said.
"Always good to see hospitality-industry facilities that are in touch with local history and heritage. In its previous incarnation, as the mere Shattuck Hotel, this venerable establishment had become somewhat seedy. This is the first time I had seen it since its re-opening and re-branding last year. You can still tell that it was built in 1910, but (mainly) in a good way. Peace! In-flight video at the site. Place your order here. Expected cost ""will be about the same as a high-end motorcycle or car,"" according to the FAQs. I know this routine! When rationalizing buying a small airplane to my family, I avoided referring to ""dollars"" and instead tried to get away with the luxury-car counting-unit too. The FAQ list also includes, What happens if the engine stops? The answer involves a parachute.

2) Courtesy of USA Today, a sane statement from a TSA official! The TSA's John Sammon, referring to possible changes in policy in light of the terrorist crash of a small airplane into the IRS office in Austin last month, said: ""It may simply be a confirmation that for very small planes you're not going to see a lot of casualties."" Obviously even one casualty is too many; obviously too, anti-IRS and anti-institutional violence of any sort is no joke.  But to be sustainable, a security policy must make sensible tradeoffs of risks and rewards; in a free society, it must also reflect a sensible long-term balance between security and liberty. You could entirely eliminate the risk of airplane hijackings or bombs if you didn't let anyone fly; you could entirely eliminate gun deaths if there were no guns; no risk of car bombs if there were not cars; etc. Panglossian that I am, I will take Mr. Sammon's comment as the dawn of a new age of sensible balance coming out of the TSA. 3) Courtesy of The Guardian, news that DARPA, the Pentagon's advanced-research body, is close to tests of a scheme to make jet fuel out of algae. This has obvious advantages over making jet fuel out of crude oil from petro-dictatorships. It has a less obvious advantage, which is that algae absorb about as much carbon when growing as their fuel releases when burned, for a much lower net-carbon impact. And unlike the benighted ethanol-subsidy program -- winner of a ""stupidest policy ever"" contest -- growing algae doesn't compete with growing crops for food. I hope this turns out to be feasible. 4) What the hell: courtesy of Crunch Gear and Sky News, let's wind up with another New Zealand candidate for ""interesting"" ways to fly. It's a home-built flying hovercraft. I can't embed the three-minute video, but it is worth going to the site to watch. The young woman reporter who takes a ride on this thing is lot more risk-tolerant than I have ever been, in either my reporting or my aviating life. Or perhaps more naively trusting. Either way, she ends up having an unexpectedly dangerous exciting ride.  More on the story here, including a shorter video that doesn't include the dramatic last minute."
I am pleased to announce that Salvatore Sanfilippo, the key developer for Redis, has decided to join the VMware engineering team. Redis is a high performance and scalable advanced key-value store where values can be data structures such as lists, sets, and hashmaps, as well as strings and blobs. Redis supports atomic operations on these data structures, allowing extremely high performance with consistent state to many client applications.

As VMware continues its investments in the context of cloud computing, technologies such as Redis become key for future cloud based apps, whether private or public cloud, and the cloud infrastructure itself. Large scale systems benefit greatly when there are alternatives to storing state within a centralized relational store (RDBMS). Many Redis customers have already experienced the tremendous benefit of storing select pieces of data within Redis for fast access, customized layout and access patterns. Some have used Redis exclusively, forgoing a relational database all together, since Redis offers several ways to persist the data it manages.

As cloud computing continues to push the bounds of how we define a cloud application, many exciting and new technologies will join the relational database as a means to store and retrieve data. Cloud based infrastructure itself has led the way in this regard, pushing the envelope for scale, performance, and access to large distributed data. This is most evident in Google's App Engine, utilizing several pieces of key technologies like BigTable to store data at scale.
As the company credited with practically inventing the Netbook category, it's no surprise Asus makes some of the most popular mini notebooks around. Top among these is the Eee PC 1005 series. Combining low (but not the lowest) prices with great battery life and good overall design, the 1005 has become the Netbook reference design for the entire industry.

The newest version, the $379 Eee PC 1005PE, is the first Netbook to reach our labs with Intel's new Atom N450 processor--the long-awaited sequel to the Atom N270 and N280 CPUs found in nearly every other Netbook.

This new 1005 model, thanks to the re-engineered Atom platform, is extremely efficient, and ran for more than 8 hours on our grueling battery drain test. That's extremely impressive, although the N450 was more of a mixed bag in our performance tests, beating other Netbooks in some categories, but matching or falling slightly behind in others.

Beyond that, the 1005PE eschews most of the recent trends in Netbook design, sticking with a 10-inch 1,024x600 pixel display, 1GB of RAM, and Windows 7 Starter. We've become accustomed to the high-def 1,366x768 pixel resolution screens found on 11-, 12-, and even some 10-inch Netbooks, so this lower resolution feels cramped and dated in comparison. Nvidia's Ion GPU is also becoming a go-to part for upscale Netbooks, but is not included here.

The Eee PC 1005PE definitely scores points for being the first laptop out of the gate with the new N450 CPU, and its battery life is nothing short of amazing--making this a very useful system for serious road warriors. But we would have liked to see a 1005 that was more fully upgraded across the board.
From China, Wei, 27, is a software programming student at the Illinois Institute of Technology and hopes to become a computer financial analyst. He is in Chicago on a student visa.

"There is a big future for financial programming," Wei said about his plans, sitting inside a modest Bridgeport apartment he shares with his wife and recently born son. "Not many people know how to do this work, or want to."

For Wei's 44-year-old half-brother, life in the U.S. has not been so bright.

Fleeing poverty, the brother arrived illegally from China nine years ago. After a harrowing trip orchestrated by "snakehead" smugglers, he has toiled 14-hour days for sub-minimum wages inside Chicago restaurants.

"His life here has been a kind of torture," Wei said.

Immigrant advocates hope Sunday's march will pressure President Barack Obama and federal lawmakers into taking up their demands for comprehensive reforms in the coming months. They argue that problems with the nation's immigration system have festered long enough -- with ongoing deportations hurting families and a booming black market in fake IDs threatening national security.

Groups in favor of tougher enforcement of immigration laws, meanwhile, have used the march plans to rally their supporters. Roy Beck, president of the Virginia-based NumbersUSA group, described Sunday's march as "the opening kickoff" in any renewed immigration debate in Washington.

On Thursday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., outlined a new bill that is the latest effort in a campaign for proposals that have been defeated twice in recent years.

Among other things, the new bill calls for biometric Social Security cards and for requiring illegal immigrants to pay fines and perform community service before they're allowed a chance at lawful permanent residency. Obama issued a statement on Thursday pledging to get such immigration legislation moving through Congress this year.

Immigrant advocates said they were encouraged by Obama's remarks, but express frustration that the president has not fulfilled a promise to act on immigration reform earlier.

"We need to see action," said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

John Darger said he has seen some of that anger in Crystal Lake, so he also plans to be on his way to Washington.

A teacher of English as a second language at McHenry County Community College, he cited stories from his Latino students about routine physical or verbal attacks, and resentful comments he's heard about newcomers from his neighbors. "The country needs to move beyond this divide," he said.

Up to 6,000 area residents left Saturday on the roughly 120 charted buses for Washington, at least half departing in a caravan from an evening rally outside U.S. Cellular Field. The turnout was the result of a weeks-long scramble for funds by immigrant activists and religious groups.

Marilyn Navarro, 16, raised the $183 it took to get a bus seat for herself and a 25-year-old cousin by putting out a donation jar inside her parents' Pilsen restaurant.

Navarro was inspired to go because her cousin arrived illegally with his parents as an 11-year-old. "It makes me so sad to know that there are millions of people out there like him," she said.
"It takes a little extra work to get in touch with Andrea Boland. The Maine state representative answers e-mails and lists her business and home phone numbers on the Web. But unlike many politicians surgically attached to their BlackBerrys, she keeps her cell switched off unless she's expecting a call. And if she has her way, everyone in Maine — and perhaps, eventually, the rest of the U.S. — will similarly think twice before jabbering away on their mobiles.

In March, Maine's legislature will begin debating a bill she submitted that would require manufacturers to put a warning label on every cell phone sold in the state declaring, ""This device emits electromagnetic radiation, exposure to which may cause brain cancer."" Her warning would continue, ""Users, especially children and pregnant women, should keep this device away from the head and body.""  For those of you now eyeing your cell phones suspiciously, it's worth noting that both the National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization say there isn't evidence to support the assertion that cell phones are a public-health threat. But a number of scientists are worried that there has been a dangerous rush to declare cell phones safe, using studies they feel are inadequate and too often weighted toward the wireless industry's interests. An analysis published by University of Washington neurologist Henry Lai determined that far more independent studies than industry-funded studies have found at least some type of biological effect from cell-phone exposure. Several countries — including Finland, Israel and France — have issued guidelines for cell-phone use. And San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who began researching the issue when his wife was expecting their first child, is hoping his city will adopt legislation that would have manufacturers print radiation information on cell-phone packaging and manuals and require retailers to display the data on the sales floor.

With 270 million Americans and 4 billion people around the world using cell phones — and more signing up every day — a strong link between mobiles and cancer could have major public-health implications. As cell phones make and take calls, they emit low-level radio-frequency (RF) radiation. Stronger than FM radio signals, these RF waves are still a billionth the intensity of known carcinogenic radiation like X-rays. The wireless industry contends that RF radiation lacks the strength to alter molecules in the human body; the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maximum for cell-phone-signal exposure is intended to prevent RF radiation from heating tissue to the point that cells are damaged. Cell-phone RF radiation's ""effect on the body, at least at this time, appears to be insufficient to produce genetic damage typically associated with developing cancer,"" Dr. Robert Hoover, director of the National Cancer Institute's Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, testified at a 2008 congressional hearing. But the body of research is far from conclusive. In 1995, Lai co-wrote a study showing that a single two-hour exposure of RF radiation — at levels considered safe by U.S. standards — produced the sort of genetic damage in rats' brain cells that can lead to cancer."
While I am giving the finishing touches at LineBall (yes, I found a sponsor), I want you to play ColorBallz. It’s a simple game I made in a couple of days starting from Basic Filler engine with Box2D – part 1, 2 and 3.

All in all it’s almost the same game, I just added a twist introducing colors. You’ll get a bonus if you fill the area with the same percentage of red, green and cyan colors. Although I already have two games about to be published, this is the first of my 10 games to be released in 2010.

It’s monetized with MochiAds but I’m also planning to sell the complete source code once it’s polished and fully commented.

At the moment, after 6 days in the wild, it has more than 100K plays… hope to reach one million in a couple of weeks.

Enjoy. Before you start reading this tutorial, there is something you must do.

Turn off the lights, close your eyes, raise your hands, and say:

« Hail, Lord of Flash Game. Shall I read this tutorial and forget it before I try to flood the web with another silly Coloring Book Game »

Really, seriously… I am showing you how do it but please, please… don’t do it.

Finding the right image

If you can’t draw your image, you’ll have to download it from the web. Try to Google for coloring book and you’ll know what I mean.

Just remember the “copyright” word… I don’t think you’re allowed to use Ben 10 or Hello Kitty images… but if you are about to create a Flash coloring book, you are an evil person and stealing artworks won’t be a problem.

The image I’ll use is taken from www.coloringbook.info

Main concept

Every colorable part is a distinct movieclip, and its color is dynamically changed with Actionscript

Converting the image

First, you need to import it into Flash  It’s a Box2D library designed to allow game developers making 2D side-scrolling platform games, including a graphical level builder that allows you to drag, drop, and customize all of the game objects and art in your game.
Everything in marketing has changed. The way budgets are divided. The way strategies are constructed. The way we view our customer and their needs. And why is this? Social media. Yes ‘social media’, the term that is used the world over by overpaid boardroom bluffers, blagging their way through a maze of seeding, virals, apps and videos of monkeys skateboarding.

Don’t get me wrong, done well (the vast majority are not) social media campaigns can engage the customer in a way that couldn’t have been imagined a decade or even five years ago. But my question is this; why when the internet is as free as the air we breathe, do digital agencies increasingly raise the budgetary bar? It's easy to see that some major brands are being convinced that they need enormous budgets to get results, whether that means investing in expensive applications and widgets or simply for the experience of the ‘Digital Guru’ they employ. In my experience there are indeed times when spending budget on social media tools and technologies is helpful or even crucial, but on-the-whole the most valuable asset we have when constructing social media campaigns remains our imagination. I know that sounds ‘Disney’, but it’s true. Chances are that the simplest idea, the idea the uses existing, free platforms and technology will capture the publics attention.

We have all been in countless brainstorms that have gone absolutely nowhere; producing tired strategies that couldn’t sell Megan Fox to a 14-year-old. But every once in a while, in what seems like your 20th meeting of the day, someone will lean back, grin and smugly utter the words “what if we did this…”. It’s instant; everyone in the room knows that this idea is the one. You don’t know whether to kiss or punch the unsuspecting genius, but you all know that’s what he is, a genius. I can only imagine that the following IKEA campaign was born of one of these moments.

Using a Facebook facility familiar to all of us, IKEA captured the attention of thousands of customers in launching their Malmo store. The following video case study shows the industry that, when it comes to social media, there is simply no substituting for that creative moment...
I encountered some ideas on web discussions like - you don't need filters with digital, or the only filter you need is a polarizer, the rest can be done in post processing.... however, the Big Six filters that are useful to most photographers, cannot adequately replace with digital techniques.....

One - The Polarizer

This is so obvious I shouldnâ€™t need to get into "why" you need it, but Iâ€™m me, and that means Iâ€™m going to talk about it anyway. Any time light moves from air to a transparent substance, some of the light doesnâ€™t penetrate into the transparent substance and is reflected away. Whether the light hits water on a lake, the natural oil on human skin, clear cellulose and wax on plant leaves and flowers, lacquer on a car or a guitar, or glass on a building, there are reflections. The reflections are â€œwhite lightâ€; they â€œfill inâ€ the color and reduce saturation. They reduce the detail visible under the clear substance. The blue of the sky is also polarized, and a polarizer can deepen the blue, and keep it from blowing out and rendering your sky a cloudless white or a drab gray.

You can fight this with post processing, but you wonâ€™t win. When you boost saturation, you fix the things that were "robbed" of contrast, but you also oversaturate the things that weren't suffering from contrast robbing reflections. And you canâ€™t replace the lost detail.

Two - The 80A "Color Balancing"

Most cameras have sensors that are "daylight balanced". They have nice, balanced red, green, and blue channel responses in neutral colored scenes lit by daylight. They achieve their incandescent white balance by amplifying the blue channel over two full stops relative to the red channel. That adds a great deal of noise to the blue channel, so you see some pretty ugly shadows. It also makes it very easy to blow the red channel, especially when shooting red dominated subjects (human skin, cosmetics, and fall colors near dusk and dawn when the light is warm).

Using an 80A will often let you get an interior architecture image in a single shot that would have taken multiple shots and HDR to do otherwise. It also makes it much easier to shoot incandescent or candlelit scenes without blowing the red channel.

Three â€“ The Neodymium Enhancing

Sensor manufacturers (like film manufacturers before them) spend a lot of effort trying to get the red, green, and blue filters in the camera to do a tolerable job of seeing colors the same way a human eye sees them. Normally, this is a "good thing", it reduces an annoying phenomena we techno-geeks call a "failure in observer metamerism", where colors that look identical to one "observer" (a human) look different to another observer (a camera, for example). The neodymium filter disrupts the nice "mimic the eye" characteristics of a sensor, and causes large-scale failures of observer metamerism. Neodymium (sometimes called â€œdidymiumâ€) does it in a way that is very pleasing in a landscape or fall color photograph: browns that would be identical in the picture (or to the eye) suddenly separate, with one turning red, another going yellow.
Less than a month after the failure of its third launch attempt, the California-based firm Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) is poised once more to loft a Falcon 1 rocket. Launch of SpaceX’s fourth Falcon 1 rocket is set for sometime between 7:00 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) tonight and 12:00 a.m. EDT (0400 GMT) on Monday, according to an update from the firm’s CEO Elon Musk. “Of course, if we see anything that requires investigation, the launch will be postponed, but we’ll let you know as soon as we know,” Musk wrote in an update posted to the SpaceX Web site on Saturday. Tonight’s planned liftoff will be staged from SpaceX’s launch site at the U.S. Army’s Ronald Reagan Ballistic Defense Test Site on the Kwajalein Atoll in the about 2,500 miles (4,023 km) southwest of Hawaii in the central Pacific Ocean. The launch will be broadcast live on the SpaceX Web site (http://www.spacex.com) when the attempt begins. SpaceX’s Falcon 1 rocket is a two-stage rocket with a reusable first stage that stands 68 feet tall (21 meters) and can haul payloads of up to about 1,256 pounds (570 kg) to low-Earth orbit. The $6.7 million rocket weighs 60,000 pounds (27,200 kg), but has failed three consecutive times since its 2006 debut. On Aug. 2, SpaceX launched its third Falcon 1 test flight only to watch it fail when the booster’s first stage separated, then impacted the second stage as both flew 135 miles (217 km) above Earth. An engine shutdown timing error was cited as the cause and could be fixed relatively easily, Musk said at the time. “The fix was also very simple, requiring one line of code to be changed,” SpaceX officials said in a weekend update. While all three of SpaceX’s first Falcon 1 launches have carried small satellite payloads, the fourth rocket is carrying “a a payload mass simulator of approximately 165 kg (364 lbs), designed and built by SpaceX specifically for this mission,” SpaceX officials said. China is just a week away from  launching its third manned spaceflight into orbit and apparently hoping for a sell-out crowd. The country is selling tickets to watch for the planned late night Sept. 25 launch of its Shenzhou 7 spacecraft, but buyer beware: Each seat goes for about 15,000 yuan, or about US$2,206 and ticket buyers will need to provide identification and a reference from their employer to vie for the limited spaces, according to the Chinese Web site China Daily and the newspaper Wenhui Daily. While hefty, the ticket price apparently includes a flight to China’s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwestern Gansu province, as well as a four-day stay to watch the planned space shot, state media reported. China first invited space fans to buy tickets for a rocket launch last year, when the country launched the Chang’e 1 moon probe from the Xichang launch center in southwestern Sichuan province. But those tickets went for about 800 yuan, or US$117, per person. Some 2,000 people watched the lunar mission’s launch from a pair of platforms about 1.5 miles (2.5 km) away, according to press reports. But the northwestern-located Jiuquan launch site is much more remote than Xichang, and offers fewer amenities and other tourist hot spots, China Daily reported.
Easy, but not necessarily right. In a letter to his younger brother, Theo, from the asylum, van Gogh articulately describes his deliberate approach to the work. "These are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts," he writes. He even flicks at the criticism he anticipates: "People will tell me the mountains aren't like that." And with a literary flourish, he describes the effect he's after: "I've tried to express the time of day when one sees the green beetles and the cicadas flying in the heat."

For all his troubles, van Gogh possessed a powerful intellect and self-awareness that he revealed as much in his writing as in his art. A prolific correspondent, his letters were collected last year into a new six-volume edition that rounds out his personality. Now a selection of those letters is on display alongside some of his finest paintings in the London Royal Academy's illuminating exhibition The Real Van Gogh: The Artist and His Letters. (A bank of computers in one gallery offers instant online access to the entire correspondence.) They present a painter's lucid, blow-by-blow report on his own progress up to the end of his life.

There is no doubt that van Gogh was driven. He could work at a pace that suggests manic intensity as well as spontaneity. In the last 70 days of his life, he produced more than 70 paintings. But what the letters frequently reveal is careful preparation; he painted with a speed derived from forethought rather than wild-eyed frenzy. His correspondence with Theo is scattered with sketches of proposed pictures, sometimes with color notations to give a better impression of the final work.

The broad outlines of his later years suggest the artist's struggles with mental illness: bouts of heavy drinking and brothel-going, poverty and isolation, his explosive reaction to light and color in Provence, his quarrel with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, self-mutilation—he presented his severed ear to a favorite prostitute—and finally his suicide at the age of 37. It all feeds the conventional picture of the artist as wayward genius.
Well, that was something wasn't it? Good luck topping that upset, everyone else left in the field.

Good to see Bill Self revive the old Roy Williams tradition of bringing a talented Kansas team favorite to the NCAA Tournament and then turfing out in the second round. (I never forget a bracket scorned.) That's what you get for messing with Kurt Warner. Oh, don't think his blessed name won't come up a few times this week. If he's not sitting front row at the regional I'll eat this delicious Kansas sunflower that just shriveled up in front of me and died.

And it's not even over! Two more games for you to curl up by the fire with. Kentucky-Wake Forest and Kansas State-BYU. What's that? You've already had too much nail-biting basketball today? Well, suck it up, junior, because THAT'S JUST TOO BAD! You're going to watch and like it.

Seriously, you've come this far. What's two more games? John Wall. Frank "Don't Call Me Frank" Martin. JIMMER! It's a who's who of guys you barely know anything about, yet are oddly fascinated by. Just order the pizza and cancel the babysitter. You're not going anywhere.
After a controversial delay in release last fall, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's fourth collaboration Shutter Island has finally arrived. Only an acclaimed master like the man who brought us Raging Bull and Taxi Driver would be bold enough to adapt Dennis Lehane's 2003 best selling mystery and faithfully recreate its haunting tone and down right creepiness. Scorsese's talent for subliminally affecting his audience with his visual style is nearly unrivaled. There are many sights to behold in Shutter Island, some of them puzzling and others so bizarre that they may eventually find their way into your subconscious. What begins as a routine mystery soon evolves into a psychological trip. Set in 1954 U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive by ferry to Shutter Island off the coast of Massachusetts and home of Ashcliffe Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Summoned by Doctor Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Deputy Warden McPherson (John Carol Lynch), Teddy and Chuck must investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient. Ashcliffe might as well be considered a fortress, because it looks inescapable, yet Rachel Solondo, a woman who drowned her three children, managed to vanish the night before. Upon examination of her locked room, Teddy discovers no evidence of an escape and begins to speculate it could have been an inside job. A clue left behind by Rachel, that initially appear to be the scribblings of an insane woman, reveals itself to be a code called “the Code of Four” which Teddy will frequently encounter. After a fruitless search of the island, Teddy and Chuck discovers one of the staff members, a Dr. Sheehan, is also missing and speculate that he may have helped Rachel escape
Amidst talk of an aging society and a depleting demographic dividend, appeals for a reconsideration of China’s One-Child Policy were voiced during the annual meetings of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference held Mar. 3 to 14.

Zhang Yin, China’s wealthiest woman and member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, called for a “gradual release” from the 30 year-old policy, with a three to five year trial period allowing some the right to have a second child before the nation as a whole.

In an interview with Southern Weekend Zhang said she was one among many who voiced concern over China’s low birth rate and the consequences of an aging society.

In an open letter issued by the Communist Party’s central committee in September of 1980, the One-Child Policy was suggested in order to relieve the demographic tensions of runaway birth rates.  The letter states that after 30 years of state controlled family planning, “different demographic policies can be adopted.”
Last week we reprinted an article discussing the 3 steps design teams take when creating an experience vision to guide the direction of design toward their users’ ideal experience. Once a design team creates that experience vision, they need to share it with everyone involved in the project to make sure everyone is on the same page as the design process progresses.

While the process of conveying the vision to key decision makers on the project and within the organization is very important, the methods used to share the vision can vary greatly depending on budget, available resources, and the pool of creative talent. Teams can use any technique, from expensive video-shoots with actors to low-fidelity stop-motion animation, as long as the vision helps the design team and stakeholders progress in the same direction and inspires team members to produce an improved experience.

In this week’s UIEtips article, I once again go back to an article UIE published in June 2007. In this article, Knowledge Navigator Deconstructed: Building an Envisionment, I discuss how a successful envisionment that focuses on the users’ ideal experiences can lead a design team’s direction for years to come. I also explore the many creative techniques for making that vision clear to everyone involved with the project.

Does your organization have an experience vision? How are you guiding your design direction toward your users’ ideal experiences? What methods to share this vision have you used? Join the discussion about this week’s topic below.

Also, I’m conducting a one day workshop in three different cities on Secrets Behind Designing Great User Experiences. One of the topics covered is the Making of a UX Vision. I take the concepts I discuss in the article into greater depth.
The new tax will not be an "insurance fund" for the banking industry, as ministers are concerned that such a measure would simply encourage more risky behaviour of the sort that led to the financial crisis of 2008. Instead resolution agreements (also known as living wills) will mean banks will be forced to break up should they ever fail again.

"We do not see the point of creating a mega-fund to prepare for another banking failure," said one well-placed source. "We do think that where people are creating risk for the tax payer they should be taxed accordingly. "It will be similar to pollution taxes on industry to discourage damage to the environment."

The International Monetary Fund will report next month on how the global community should respond to the need to control systemic risk in the financial system. It is believed that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, will broadly welcome plans for extra taxes on banking's riskier activities.

Treasury officials said that Britain would not "go it alone" on the new tax, and that it was likely there would be agreement on similar tax regimes across the world.

The news comes after David Cameron, the leader of the Opposition, announced that the Conservatives would be willing to act unilaterally on an international banking tax if there was no global
agreement.

Tory sources said, though, it was unlikely they would have to, given signals from the G20. President Obama has said that he supports new levies on banking in America.

The UK banking lobby has warned that any tax on banks must not undermine attempts to resuscitate the economy.

Responding to Mr Cameron's speech yesterday, a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: "UK banks have already made changes to how they are structured and the amount of capital and cash they hold to help prevent any future problems.

"We believe any further reforms need to be timely, considered and internationally co-ordinated so they do not restrict credit to individuals and businesses as recovery picks up speed.

"Taxpayer intervention to stabilise the UK banking industry is on track to be paid back. And we will work with everyone on issues around a last-resort intervention fund – as well as other means to protect the taxpayer should a problem arise in the future.But UK banks believe the best course is to wait for the outcome of next month's IMF proposals."

Mr Cameron announced the measures while speaking to supporters in Putney, south-west London.

He said: "This is no time to shy away from confronting some of the biggest vested interests in our country – the banks. We had the biggest bank bail-out in the world. We can't just carry on as if nothing happened."

Referring to President Obama's plans to recover funds used to bail out US banks, he said: "Why should it be any different here? A Conservative government will introduce a new bank levy to pay back tax payers and to protect them in the future.

"It won't be popular in every part of the City. But I believe it's fair and it's necessary."
I started explaining how atleast I was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining.  I was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again. But she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences. She told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be. But, the guy replied atleast I don't suck like the ones who have no legs and feet. Imagine how much it would suck to be them. Suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude. She very simply asked me if maybe I was doing the same thing. If maybe I was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a  person with no limbs at all. I replied by saying that I was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because I wanted to not be like them. For me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery. It was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart. She thought so too I guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ;). But this is what your smart friends do to you. They extract these insightful thoughts out of you, but still leave you with doubts. But this is what I relish. This is what I feel is the best part about having them around. Life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself. But smarter ones make life interesting. They challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too. That conversation left me in a similar place. Even though I seemed to have convinced my friend, I wasn't sure I had convinced myself. But, the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day, I have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity. Now every time I compare myself in a situation, I take a moment to figure out the reasons for which I am doing it. Ever since that day, I have tried to follow that smart rohanism I uttered out of nowhere. For the most part, it has helped :) I like analogies. I love drawing parallels in life. Compare one stage with another. Find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others. To see how as we change we still remain the same. Friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources. To try and explain every occurrence I see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated. As if it's a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base. One thing I have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the sudden onset of loneliness.
Specifically, something Hawks coach Joel Quenneville said after throwing minor-league call-up Corey Crawford into the net against the Ducks on Wednesday. Crawford made one mistake, running off the leash and giving up a short-handed goal, but even in losing the horrifically officiated game, the kid played well enough that you know he’ll get another start.

In fact, he might get it even after Cristobal Huet is sufficiently recovered from the flu. Yeah, that would give the Hawks three goalies, and man, you talk about a crisis of confidence, but Quenneville’s post-mortem on Crawford makes me think it’s coming.

Quenneville said Crawford “looked comfortable’’ and “looked big.’’ Those might seem to be harmless phrases because it comes down to stopping the puck and winning games, but here’s the thing: A coach doesn’t know that until it’s too late, until after the game, so he has to make a decision based on stats and gut feeling, not always in that order and not always equally.

In Quenneville’s case, the “looked comfortable’’ part is code for a coach feeling comfortable. The “looked big’’ part is how much net the goalie leaves open, especially after he drops to the ice. If there has been one significant reason that Quenneville continually turns to rookie Antti Niemi when looking for a goalie to get hot and make him feel comfortable, it’s that. How much net can you cover when you’re vulnerable?

Niemi and Crawford each are listed at 6-foot-2, an inch taller than Huet, but Niemi and Crawford play bigger and wider when they go down. Shooters appear to have less space up top against them than against Huet. Anybody can play goalie if the Hawks are going to check the way they smothered the Kings --- good thing, too, what with their lousy passing and puck handling --- but nobody can do that every night and goalies have to win games, or at least look like they can do it in difficult situations.

Bigger goalies do that. Or goalies who appear to be bigger targets. Size matters. So, you watch, Crawford will be coming to a net near you. I would tell Huet to get well quickly, but I don’t know if it will matter.
In case you have broken legs or are allergic to joy or something and you can't leave your house this beautiful weekend, we suggest you catch up with Breaking Bad in time for the third season premiere on Sunday.

Let's just put it up front: I know we had a big old BB takeover on this here webbersite just yesterday, but this has nothing to do with that. I genuinely happen to like something that our ad people took money from. Why do I like it so much?

Well, it's smart and exciting and moving without showing any of the pesky nuts and bolts of what make a show smart and exciting and moving. You know how on Mad Men sometimes, just sometimes, you can almost see the writers straining to get that story arc so perfectly crafted? That doesn't happen on Breaking Bad, probably because by design it's smaller, lower to the ground, scruffier. It's a show about a guy dying of cancer who starts cooking meth to leave his family with some money and is therefore about big things like Death & Dying and The Drug Trade In the American Southwest, but it's also maybe the most quietly pro-family (in the good way) show on the air. It's got a deep and satisfying and thoroughly realistic humanity to it that makes you feel like you're watching friends, people you know. Which makes it all the more shocking when the drugs and the guns and the bodies start piling up.
Back in January, we called Tina Fey “the first true female Woody Allen” — and quickly added, “Which is not to discount Cathy Guisewite and her clear influence on 30 Rock.” And wouldn’t you know it: Last night, when Liz Lemon ran into her starchy anti-husband Wesley (last name Snipes) at a showing of Hot Tub Time Machine (nice product placement! We’re totally seeing that), their inevitable bickering led Wesley to compare Liz’s life to “something out of a Cathy cartoon — it just won’t end.” Now, comparing 30 Rock to Cathy isn’t exactly obscure or brilliant, but to do it in such a terrific episode — really, a Cathy parody — reminds us of just how sharp this show remains.

Things got off to a lightning-paced start, with Jack’s company-wide meeting that devolved, randomly and almost immediately, into city rivalries, with Boston-bred Jack throwing a battery at Liz in return for her Philly snowball, and all of it culminating in Jenna shoving a man away from the mike and breaking out into “Amazing Grace.” The stories that followed — Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown (and suggesting “porn for women,” meh), Liz contemplating Wesley (Snipes) for a “settling soul mate,” and Tracy dealing with the world’s discovery of his fidelity to his wife — were all quite comfortably situated in the show’s wheelhouse, but great vehicles for the gags, a few of which we can’t resist bullet-pointing here.

• Tracy’s Ben and Jerry’s flavor, “Adultaraisin.”
• Tracy’s Post headline, “Old Faithful.”
• The glimpse of the lesbian and the Hasid canoodling in the dentist’s recovery room.
• Jenna confusing Tiger Woods and O.J. Simpson. Yikes!
• Jack “the Master Baiter” Donaghy
• “I innovate products.”
• Don Geiss encased in Carbonite.
• And greatest of all, Fresh Ass: Based on the Novel Tush by Assfire

"Architectural design is always about the future; when architects make a proposition they always assume that it takes place in some imagined future. Architects nearly always assume that this future will be ‘better’ than the present, often as a consequence of what is being proposed. Architecture is, by its very nature, utopian.
Contemporary architecture, unlike earlier models of ‘utopian’ architecture, or perhaps because of the stigma attached to those models, has resisted an explicitly social and political agenda. Instead it has become driven by ‘ideal’ formalist agendas facilitated by the ‘shape-making’ potential of new computer-based design tools and funded by speculative finance.
Indeed, the most important transformations that have occurred in architecture over the last 30 years have not been in the shifts in fashion marking out new typologies, new forms of representation, new materials or new forms of manufacture; the biggest single shift has been in the new economic relations within the building industry and the new forms of contractual relationships that this has brought about. The rise of fast-track construction in the 1980s heralded a major change in the motivations for construction and brought about a homogenisation of building output largely predicated on maximising the economic value of the project, often with little regard for its social value.
And with the introduction of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) the current UK government has turned even health-care and educational building programmes into a speculative enterprise. PFI has always been presented as a cost-effective way of financing large infrastructural projects; however, like the government’s recent bail out of the banks, it works on the principle of the public financing the risk while the private sector skims off the profit.[3] For a number of years the single model that has shaped the type of future that the architectural profession has based its assumptions on is one of unfettered consumer expansion. The majority of recent architectural debates have not tried to call into question the economic imperatives of late capitalism that drive financial speculation and generate the context within which private development is presented as the only option. Even the avant-garde architectural firms of the 1980s are now operating as large international commercial practices, and the Deconstructivists have proved to be more than enthusiastic capitalists. The critical and intellectual ambitions inspired by Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Guy Debord have been replaced with the monetarist ideologies of Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan.

The architectural profession has embraced the late capitalist model enthusiastically and uncritically, while all the time pandering to the concepts of social and environmental responsibility. The fact is that this model has been funded through speculative investment, and now that the money has run out the profession is bereft of alternatives."
Here's an equation I bet you've never seen in a math class:

Buick LaCrosse + Providence at lunchtime = Serious Sandwiches.

Let me explain. Alaina and I cruised out of Boston at around 11:30. Our plan: head to Providence for a mini sandwich tour. (That'd be a limited tour of Providence sandwiches—not a tour of Providence mini-sandwiches.) I've been hearing a lot about the sandwiches made and sold at the the food store-cum-cheese shop Farmstead, by husband and wife chef team Matt and Kate Jennings (owners of the highly regarded bistro La Laiterie).

I figured that we would take our sandwiches and eat them in our roomy LaCrosse as we made our way to our second Providence sandwich shop, Hewtin's Mobile Hot Dog Truck, owned by another Providence based husband and wife team—Matthew and Kristin Gennuso of Chez Pascal. What better time to visit a food truck in New England than on a sunny day in mid-March, with wheels at your disposal? And since we'd left Carey behind in Boston, we rendezvoused with one of our terrific Serious Eats interns, Brown student Leah Douglas.

Sounds like a pretty cool itinerary, doesn't it? When we arrived at Farmstead, it turned out there was seating available at La Laiterie, so we were able to enjoy a leisurely lunch utilizing real tables and chairs. As is our wont, we ordered just about every sandwich on the menu. The highlights? The cheesemonger's grilled cheese was in fact made in a sandwich press rather than grilled. I don't even know what cheeses were in it, but there was definitely something cheddar-y in there because the sandwich had that primordial cheddar ooze. Add in a helpful (if a little disorganized) staff that was eager to please and you end up with a fine lunch first course.
Apple will be hosting a WebKit Contributors Meeting at its campus in Cupertino, CA on Monday, April 12 and Tuesday, April 13 from 9am to 6pm PDT. The meeting is targeted at contributors to the WebKit Open Source Project. The meeting will have an “unconference”-like format, allowing plenty of time for impromptu sessions/discussions and hacking.

A new mailing list, webkit-meeting, will be used for general discussion and to communicate additional information about the meeting. You can subscribe at lists.webkit.org. Questions may also be sent to Adele Peterson at adele at webkit.org.

The meeting will be free of charge. All WebKit contributors are encouraged to attend. However, space is limited, so registrations will be accepted on a first come, first served basis.

Please register for the meeting using the meeting registration form by Thursday, April 1.

We hope to see you there!


Daniel has made many valuable contributions to WebKit including additions to the XSSAuditor, which helps prevent reflective cross site scripting attacks, as well as numerous changes to drag and drop ensuring that WebKit complies with the HTML5 spec. Of course, all of this was supported with thorough tests and improvements to WebKit’s testing harness. Recently, Daniel has been working on features for mobile devices such as a cross platform patch to enable faster mobile scrolling on pages with static background images.

Please join me in congratulating Daniel on his reviewer status!


Nate got his start in WebKit with helping to upstream Javascript bindings for the Chromium port into WebKit. During that work, he learned much about WebKit style as well as getting to know the bindings quite well. Since then, he continued to do a prodigious amount with the bindings and improved them in many ways. In addition, he also added noreferrer support and fixed bugs in a variety of areas such as the loader and plugin scripting.

"The word blog is a conflation of two words: Web and log. It contains in its four letters a concise and accurate self-description: it is a log of thoughts and writing posted publicly on the World Wide Web. In the monosyllabic vernacular of the Internet, Web log soon became the word blog. This form of instant and global self-publishing, made possible by technology widely available only for the past decade or so, allows for no retroactive editing (apart from fixing minor typos or small glitches) and removes from the act of writing any considered or lengthy review. It is the spontaneous expression of instant thought—impermanent beyond even the ephemera of daily journalism. It is accountable in immediate and unavoidable ways to readers and other bloggers, and linked via hypertext to continuously multiplying references and sources. Unlike any single piece of print journalism, its borders are extremely porous and its truth inherently transitory. The consequences of this for the act of writing are still sinking in.

A ship’s log owes its name to a small wooden board, often weighted with lead, that was for centuries attached to a line and thrown over the stern. The weight of the log would keep it in the same place in the water, like a provisional anchor, while the ship moved away. By measuring the length of line used up in a set period of time, mariners could calculate the speed of their journey (the rope itself was marked by equidistant “knots” for easy measurement). As a ship’s voyage progressed, the course came to be marked down in a book that was called a log. In journeys at sea that took place before radio or radar or satellites or sonar, these logs were an indispensable source for recording what actually happened. They helped navigators surmise where they were and how far they had traveled and how much longer they had to stay at sea. They provided accountability to a ship’s owners and traders. They were designed to be as immune to faking as possible. Away from land, there was usually no reliable corroboration of events apart from the crew’s own account in the middle of an expanse of blue and gray and green; and in long journeys, memories always blur and facts disperse. A log provided as accurate an account as could be gleaned in real time.

As you read a log, you have the curious sense of moving backward in time as you move forward in pages—the opposite of a book. As you piece together a narrative that was never intended as one, it seems—and is—more truthful. Logs, in this sense, were a form of human self-correction. They amended for hindsight, for the ways in which human beings order and tidy and construct the story of their lives as they look back on them. Logs require a letting-go of narrative because they do not allow for a knowledge of the ending. So they have plot as well as dramatic irony—the reader will know the ending before the writer did."
Outfitted with burly outsoles, waterproof materials, and big toe guards, trail shoes are built to bring you closer to nature. As the following reviews indicate, not every trail shoe is perfect for every off-road outing. Some are built low and feature sticky treads that grip mucky footpaths and shale-strewn climbs. Others have smaller treads and thicker cushioning more appropriate for less-rugged terrain. To determine how they measure up, we analyzed each shoe at the RW Shoe Lab and tested them on the feet of more than 200 runners. We found these nine shoes to be the best for tackling the trails. WE SAY This is one of the few trail shoes with enough cushioning to handle long stretches of road and still provide sure footing on loose terrain and mud, thanks to its deep lugs. It also features a grippy edge in the heel that helps maintain traction going downhill. RW Shoe Lab tests show the shoe's heel and forefoot to be among the softest in this guide. All this cushioning results in a bulkier-than average midsole that some testers felt lifted them too high off the ground. Recommended for trail runners who frequently mix in some roads and don't want to sacrifice off-road traction.

WEAR-TESTER SAYS "I liked the traction, but the heel felt high."—Jenna Druver, 32, East Lansing
I can respect conservatives who can respect liberals. I can work with conservatives who are willing to work with progressives. If your goal is to move America rather than your party forward, than I'd like to shake your hand and find a way to do it together. What I cannot respect are people who think it's painfully obvious that their beliefs are the one and only definition of "right" or of "American." I cannot abide for half a second those people who think anyone even half an inch different than they are unpatriotic, socialist, elitist, stupid, or undeserving.

And that is why I loathe Glenn Beck and the Tea Party movement. You think government is too big? Okay, I get that. You think the President is taking us down a bad path? I disagree, but whatever. You believe Congress is broken? Who doesn't. You think black people who dare to disagree with you are Soviet Kenyan n------s who gas Jews? Well in that case, you represent none of the best and all of the worst of American history, you racist, uninformed, self-righteous, cowardly, unpatriotic, anarchist halfwit toads. Roll Call reports: Do these addle-brained huns really think they’re going to change anyone’s mind with racist name calling? Do you they honestly think that this tripe passes for factual discourse? As conservative Joe Scarborough tweets, "John Lewis is a friend, a great man and an American hero. Anyone attacking such a man with racial slurs has a dark heart and a grim soul." And "Also, the attacks against Barney Frank were hateful and outrageous. Barney and I usually disagreed in Congress but he loves his country."
Lancs are through to Barbados T20 semi

Posted By graham.hardcastle for World of Sport

 

Lancashire have just sneaked through to Finals Day of the Twenty20 competition at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.

The Red Rose county were made to work hard with the bat in their pursuit of 131 against a select XI from the host Island, but Tom Smith’s 48 was the mainstay of their reply. The Lightning won with three wickets and two balls to spare.

The left-hander looked upset at being given out caught behind when the ball seemed to loop up off his pad onto his gloves and through to the keeper.

I remember him telling me last year that he was gutted not to be there at the end of a win against Glamorgan at the SWALEC after doing all the hard work, and this was a similar circumstance.

Lancashire will now play Essex in the first semi-final early evening your time back home (5.30pm), while Roses rivals Yorkshire were the shock losers of the day. They went down by 58 runs to a University of the West Indies XI after being bowled out for 63!!

There were a couple of hundred spectators throughout the day at the impressive Kensington Oval, and there are a few more expected for the Finals Day tomorrow due to the fact that there is some home presence in the students.

There was a little bit of a worry for the Lightning, with skipper Glen Chapple taking a bang on his finger during fielding.

He only bowled two overs before leaving the field and letting Mark Chilton take over the leadership duties.

Chappie came back out to bat later on to help guide his side over the winning line, but Peter Moores said afterwards that he might not be fit to play in the semi and hopefully final of the Barbados Cricket Cup.

I remember the ex-England man tearing a hamstring in Sharjah last pre-season, but this injury doesn’t sound anywhere near as serious.
On March 12th, Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass will be together again in theaters for their latest action thriller, “Green Zone,” a film set in the chaotic early days of the Iraqi War when no one could be trusted and every decision could detonate unforeseen consequences. Damon and Greengrass have clearly proven that they’ve got chemistry, what with their work together on “The Bourne Supremacy” and “The Bourne Ultimatum,” and we’re obviously looking forward to checking it out, but…well, here’s the thing: Damon’s a great action hero, but he can be pretty hilarious, too, and “Green Zone” doesn’t exactly look like what you’d call a laff riot. 1. Glory Daze (1996): Okay, we’ll be honest with you: Damon’s barely in this film. It’s really a vehicle for his longtime buddy, Ben Affleck, who sports some seriously douche-tastic facial hair throughout the film. Although the remarkable number of recognizable faces to be found within the cast make it worth checking out (Sam Rockwell, Alyssa Milano, Matthew McConaughey, John Rhys-Davies, Kristin Bauer, French Stewart, Brendan Fraser, Leah Remini, Meredith Salinger, Mary Woronov, and Spaulding Gray all make appearances), the predominant reason we’ve included “Glory Daze” – which is, for the record, explores the hesitation all college graduates experience before entering the real world – is because no matter how many films he may eventually have to his credit, Matt Damon should never be allowed to escape the fact that, even though it was only for a few fleeting moments, he once played a character named Edward Pudwacker.
To me, one of the most enjoyable parts of a baseball card is not so much the player, but what's in the background of the photo. It's especially fun when an old advertisement takes a prominent spot, like this one of Bill Fahey from 1973 Topps. (In fact, 1973 Topps may contain the greatest photo backgrounds of any set, ever, but that's a topic for another post.) In plain sight to the left of Fahey there's an ad for the fine dining and cocktail options available at Harris' Imperial House in Boca Raton, Florida. The card also features an ad for Fowlkes Chevrolet, which, judging from information available on the Web, may or may not be related in some way with Mayes Chevrolet, which had been on the former Storyland Park property in Broward County, Florida (Pompano Beach: A History). Next time you're going through your cards, find a good one with a prominent ad in the background of the player photo and post a scan on The Baseball Card Blog's Facebook page. I bet we'll get a great gallery going.
This is a totally different way from thinking about things than I think we see nowadays. I kind of liken it to how I tell students not to program. If you're implementing something moderately complex (say, forward/backward algorithm), first write down all the math, then start implementing. Don't start implementing first. I think nowadays (and sure, I'm guilty!) we see a lot of implementing without the math. Or rather, with plenty of math, but without a representational model of what it is that we're studying. The central claim of the RST paper is that one can think of texts as being organized into elementary discourse units, and these are connected into a tree structure by relations like the one above. (Or at least this is my reading of it.) That is, they have laid out a representation of text and claimed that this is how texts get put together. As a second example (this will be sorter), take Wendy Lehnert's 1982 paper, "Plot units and narrative summarization." Here, the story is about how stories get put together. The most interesting thing about the plot units model to me is that it breaks from how one might naturally think about stories. That is, I would naively think of a story as a series of events. The claim that Lehnert makes is that this is not the right way to think about it. Rather, we should think about stories as sequences of affect states. Effectively, an affect state is how a character is feeling at any time. (This isn't quite right, but it's close enough.) For example, Lehnert presents the following story: When John tried to start his care this morning, it wouldn't turn over. He asked his neighbor Paul for help. Paul did something to the carburetor and got it going. John thanked Paul and drove to work.
I finished K-means and Gaussian mixture models in class last week or maybe the week before. I've previously discussed the fact that these two are really solving different problems (despite being structurally so similar), but today's post is about something different. There are two primary differences between the typical presentation of K-means and the typical presentation of GMMs. (I say "typical" because you can modify these algorithms fairly extensively as you see fit.) The first difference is that GMMs just have more parameters. The parameters of K-means are typically the cluster assignments ("z") and the means ("mu"). The parameters of a GMM are typically these (z and mu) as well as the class prior probabilities ("pi") and cluster covariances ("Sigma"). The GMM model is just richer. Of course, you can restrict it so all clusters are isotropic and all prior probabilities are even, in which case you've effectively removed this difference (or you can add these things into K-means). The second difference is that GMMs operate under the regime of "soft assignments," meaning that points aren't wed to clusters: they only prefer (in a probabilistic sense) some clusters to others. This falls out naturally from the EM formalization, where the soft assignments are simply the expectations of the assignments under the current model. One can get rid of the second difference by running "hard EM" (also called "Viterbi EM" in NLP land), where the expectations are clamped at their most likely value. This leads to something that has much more of a K-means feel. This "real EM" versus "hard EM" distinction comes up a lot in NLP, where computing exact expectations is often really difficult. (Sometimes you get complex variants, like the "pegging" approaches in the IBM machine translation models, but my understanding from people who run in this circle is that pegging is much ado about nothing.) My general feeling has always been "if you don't have much data, do real EM; if you have tons of data, hard EM is probably okay." (This is purely from a practical perspective.) The idea is that when you have tons and tons of data, you can approximate expectations reasonably well by averaging over many data points. (Yes, this is hand-wavy and it's easy to construct examples where it fails. But it seems to work many times.) Of course, you can get pedantic and say "hard EM sucks: it's maximizing p(x,z) but I really want to maximize p(x)" to which I say: ho hum, who cares, you don't actually care about p(x), you care about some extrinsic evaluation metric which, crossing your fingers, you hope correlates with p(x), but for all I know it correlates better with p(x,z). Nevertheless, a particular trusted friend has told me he's always remiss when he can't do full EM and has to do hard EM: he's never seen a case where it doesn't help. (Or maybe "rarely" would be more fair.) Of course, this comes at a price: for many models, maximization (search) can be done in polynomial time, but computing expectations can be #P-hard (basically because you have to enumerate -- or count -- over every possible assignment). Now let's think about approximate inference in graphical models. Let's say I have a graphical model with some nodes I want to maximize over (call them "X") and some nodes I want to marginalize out (call them "Z"). For instance, in GMMs, the X nodes would be the means, covariances and cluster priors; the Z nodes would be the assignments. (Note that this is departing slightly from typical notation for EM.) Suppose I want to do inference in such a model. Here are three things I can do:
I always wanted to have a nickname. Something that had to do with an experience, or perhaps from not being able to pronounce my name correctly as a child, or even something wildly nonsensical that had nothing to do with anything. Like Crime Dog. In the grand scheme of things, Crime Dog isn't bad (for those not in the know, it refers to MacGruff, the bloodhound in the trenchcoat who encouraged kids on Saturday morning to 'Take a Bite Out of Crime'), though slightly bizarre. It's better than being referred to as Three-Finger or Stumpy. Plus it shortens easily to 'Dog.' As in, 'Dog, you can carve the turkey' or 'Hurry Dog, cut the red wire. No no, the red one!' But that's just the thing about nicknames: you don't decide if you get one; someone else does. And though most baseball nicknames derive from the player's last name, I would bet that Crime Dog was the product of nickname evolution. You don't just wake up one morning with a nickname epiphany (unless your name is Shaquille O'Neal). So unless I become a gangster, a character on a TV show, or join a baseball team, I'm resigned to spend my life as Ben. Not Piano Legs or Baby Face. Just Ben. Only, simply Ben. I guess it could be worse. At least I won't be called Steve Urkel for the rest of my life.
Just run max-product. That is, maximize p(X,Z) rather than p(X). Just run sum-product. That is, compute expectations over X and Z, rather than just over Z. Run EM, by alternating something like sum-product on Z and something like max-product onX. Of these, only (3) is really doing the "right thing." Further, let's get away from the notion of p(X) not correlating with some extrinsic evaluation by just measuring ourselves against exact inference. (Yes, this limits us to relatively small models with 10 or 20 binary nodes.) What do you think happens? Well, first, things vary as a function of the number of X nodes versus Z nodes in the graph. When most of the nodes are X (maximization) nodes, then max-product does best and EM basically does the same. Whe most of the nodes are Z (marginalization) nodes, then EM does best and sum-product does almost the same. But max product also does almost the same. This is an effect that we've been seeing regularly, regardless of what the models look like (chains or lattices), what the potentials look like (high temperature or low temperature) and how you initialize these models (eg., in the chain case, EM converges to different places depending on initialization, while sum- and max-product do not). Max product is just unbeatable. In a sense, from a practical perspective, this is nice. It says: if you have a mixed model, just run max product and you'll do just as well as if you had done something more complicated (like EM). But it's also frustrating: we should be getting some leverage out of marginalizing over the nodes that we should marginalize over. Especially in the high temperature case, where there is lots of uncertainty in the model, max product should start doing worse and worse (note that when we evaluate, we only measure performance on the "X" nodes -- the "Z" nodes are ignored). Likening this back to K-means versus GMM, for the case where the models are the same (GMM restricted to not have priors or covariances), the analogy is that as far as the means go, it doesn't matter which one you use. Even if there's lots of uncertainty in the data. Of course, you may get much better assignments from GMM (or you may not, I don't really know). But if all you really care about at the end of the day are the Xs (the means), then our experience with max-product suggests that it just won't matter. At all. Ever. Part of me finds this hard to believe, and note that I haven't actually run experiments with K-means and GMM, but the results in the graphical model cases are sufficiently strong and reproducible that I'm beginning to trust them. Shouldn't someone have noticed this before, though? For all the effort that's gone into various inference algorithms for graphical models, why haven't we ever noticed that you just can't beat max-product? (Yes, I'm aware of some theoretical results, eg., the Wainwright result that sum-product + randomized rounding is a provably good approximation to the MAP assignment, but this result actually goes the other way, and contradicts many of our experimental studies where sum-product + rounding just flat out sucks. Maybe there are other results out there that we just haven't been able to dig up.)
There was a time early on in my days where I could jump out of bed and greet the world with tremendous vigor. There was a time early on in my life where my memory was sharp and clear. Now I get out of bed gently, slowly and greet the world with “oh shit, my back”. My memory loss is apparent whenever I meet someone for the first time and they give me their name, only for me to forget it 10 seconds into the conversation. Good Times……..good times.
I don't know if it has something to do with all the medicine that I'm on, or the fact asthma causes some degree of stress, or the fact that I'm forced to be "unique" because of asthma, or due to anxiety, or sinus problems, or allergies, or wimpiness or what. But, I sometimes get these terrible headaches, and I have one right now. Actually I have dulled it with an Ultram, but it's still there. I woke up at 2 a.m. with this headache so bad there was no way I was going to go back to sleep, so I got up and took two 500 mg Tylenol. I have to take that much, because one never quite cuts it. I knew this was not a Tylenol headache, though. Yet I had to try it. I had to try something before I took an Ultram. I had to because once I take an Ultram, once it kicks in, I have to write. Doesn't that sound weird. Yep! Ultram relaxes me to the point, puts all these ideas in my head, and I have to put them on paper. I've written some good stuff while on Ultram. Ultram dulls or gets rid of my headaches no matter how bad, it's the first drug I have ever taken that gives me at least some degree of relief. However, even though it is not an opiate, and my doctor says it's safe to use it and work, it gives me the feeling that about three cups of coffee gives me, although without the side effects such as shakiness and such. It just makes me feel euphoric, and happy.
On Friday evening, I found the mother lode of pain located – conveniently enough – in my right wrist. The most intense episode lasted about an hour. When it passed, I proudly reminded myself about how such episodes in the past used to emotionally knock me down for days, which did not seem to be the case anymore. Sure, these episodes continue to be difficult to get through, but at least I seem to be a little more “prepared” for them. Yesterday afternoon, when I was at physical therapy, we once again reached the point where the maximum electrotherapy current was being delivered to my ankles, and I couldn't feel a thing. In the past, I used to break down right at that moment, as it served as a objective and stark reminder of exactly how much pain I was in. Yesterday, I held my head up high as I remembered this, and told myself that I would get through this episode as I have gotten through other episodes. Later during the day, I completely lost the use of my left hand for more than an hour. As luck would have it, this coincided with the time when we sat down to eat a meal. In the past, I would have have been reluctant to ask for help and would have instead struggled to cut my own food, resulting in even more pain. Yesterday, I calmly asked for help, and even through I am left-handed, I used my right hand to lift my fork. When a small glass of jello was served for dessert, I propped it up in between my knees and scooped it up with a spoon – without so much as a second thought. I once again felt proud of myself.
Over the past week I've received a lot of recommendations for Keepers, so I thought I'd kick things off by talking about one of my favorite cards: 1960 Leaf "Baseball's Two Hal Smiths". It's on my Keeper List, and is a card I don't own. It's a Keeper because it isn't clear what the two Hal Smiths are doing in their photo. Are they negotiating over the bill? Are they diapering a baby? Because the background has been removed, context is missing (and desperately, desperately needed). These guys could be anywhere – a bus stop... a locker room... It's no secret, my love for 1960 Leaf (read my set review here). The photos are mug-shot bad, the cards themselves came packaged with marbles, and the design has a style aesthetic with as much pizzazz as checkerboard kitchen linoleum. But what it's lacking in visual appeal, it more than makes up for in awkwardness. Awkward halos behind each head. Awkward checklist including immortal baseball gods Stover McIlwain (out of the league since 1958), Marshall Renfroe (career = 1 game in 1959), and baseball's two Hal Smiths (one a journeyman, the other an All Star). And did I mention that the cards were awkwardly packaged with marbles? I understand that Topps had cornered the market on the cards and gum thing, but seriously, who came up with marbles? There's something about Hal Smith... both of him. I can't think of another time when two players shared the same name. (Wait a minute... Steve Ontiveros? Weren't there two of that guy?) I've mentioned this already, but one Hal was a journeyman and the other Hal was an All Star. The All Star had a knack for showing up on his baseball cards in full catcher regalia; that is, toothily smiling through his mask in a creepy crouching position. I can think of at least two cards (1958 Topps and 1960 Topps) of him photographed like that. The journeyman was just ugly: pursed lips, narrowed eyes... it was as if he was a street-corner criminal scouting for the next fence. This one is also a Keeper for me because it's a combo card. But instead of Hal and Hal hamming it up under a corny line like "Backstop Buddies" or something, as Topps was wont to do throughout the Sixties, Sports Novelties kept it obvious, in a Ripley's Believe-it-or-Not informative kind of way. It's "Baseball's Two Hal Smiths" because that's who they are. In the end it matters not what they're doing, just that they appear together. That's why this one's a Keeper.
As most parents know, and as we're learning, once they start crawling and standing and exploring, the battle dominance and safety between parents and children over has only just begun. After over a month of putting it off, Tricia and I decided this morning (with Gwyneth's help) that our project over the weekend must be Gwyneth-proofing the house. Just this morning our fearless, diapered, red-kneed trouble maker rediscovered the cat food, learned how to open the kitchen cabinets and decided that a very tall study lamb had to be more fun parallel to the floor. So, we're off to Home Depot and Walmart to stock up. Got any tips, products, resources or creative battle strategies to share with us? Now's your chance to help us get starting with a victory!
 I couldn't read. I had no concept of time. I had no clue what baseball was. I didn't know the World Series existed before the Red Sox made it there in 1986. But stickers? Yeah, I kinda knew what stickers were. Stickers and I have enjoyed a love-love relationship my whole life. Dinosaur stickers begot robot stickers eventually begot Obey Giant stickers. So when I reached a certain collecting-and-knowing-what-baseball-was-age, stickers and I rekindled our love affair once more in the form of the Panini and Topps sticker books. I never completed my sticker albums, but I was always gung-ho. I just want to get all of this off my chest before I start down this long, sometimes dusty, but always sticky road. Initial Thoughts 1982 Topps Stickers. Man, that kid on the box is kind of creepy, isn't he? And yet, I'd be as stoked as he obviously is if I was eight years old and embarking on a magnificent sticker-filled adventure. If we all agree for the moment that the kid on the box was around eight years old in 1982... he would be 36 today. Gary Carter is on the front of the album, and each page has a slightly obscured shadow portrait of a member of each team. What's creepy about this is that the eyes have been removed from each person, leaving somewhat anonymous baseball-playing zombies haunting the backgrounds of each page. Twenty cents for five stickers to a pack, which means the minimum a kid was spending to fill his or her album was (260 stickers/5= 52 unique packs) 52 x 20¢ = $10.40 (+ 25¢ for the album)... So a total of $10.65 to complete the album without ever getting a double. Not exactly chump change to a kid in 1982. So I've armed myself with a complete, unopened box of stickers (100 packs), which was easier than expected to track down, and an unused sticker album. Let's get this sticker party started
You know, I want to be excited by this. It looks like they even got Marvin from Pulp Fiction. You know, the guy they accidently shoot and have to call Harvey Keitel to mop up the blood. Well, I don't see a credit for Back on Topps on his imdb.com page, but that really looks like him. I also like the reference to the "cocaine out of a bread truck," though if we remember back to last year, I believe it was a Mr. Softee truck out in Jamaica, Queens, where the driver was selling cocaine on the side. (His trick? Double-cupping the sundaes. Ingenious.) So yeah, I want to get excited. But you know what would really get me jazzed on this series--and yes, I just said 'jazzed', which hopefully came across in a completely non-sexual way, though now that I've taken the energy to explain probably does come across as sexual--? I think you know... That's right: a re-occurring character who either appears in a dream sequence or within the wacky corporate world of Topps HQ who also happens to be on a mini Allen & Ginter card (or 1975 Topps Mini). Or is Lil' Kwame Brown. This character would best be played by a real-life athlete, with his character name simply his real name with 'Baby' or 'Lil'' in front of it. Like "Baby Rafael Furcal" or "Lil' Dmitri". Actually, that last one's not bad. Get Dmitri Young on the phone to play the Topps egghead archivist (who expounds on his love of gem mint cards and also happens to be trapped on a mini A & G card).
I take collation pretty seriously, mostly because I enjoy knowing what I'm going to get once I know the top card (or sticker, as the case may be). For this box, if Tom Seaver was first out of the pack, your four others would be in this order: Jerry Remy, Dusty Baker, Mike Schmidt, and Vida Blue. Similarly, if you pulled Paul Molitor first, there was nearly a 100% chance that the third sticker would be Manny Trillo, the fourth sticker would be Bob Horner, and the second and fifth stickers would be random. Even the seemingly random-seeded stickers weren't seeded all that randomly. For instance, Andre Dawson was locked in the 1 hole, John Castino and Fred Lynn both 2's, John Mayberry a 3, Pete Rose Highlight a 4, and Cecil Cooper, Cliff Johnson, Dave Collins, and at least 18 others at 5. There were "Rogue" stickers as well, or those that didn't appear in a consistent slot (Keith Hernandez, Rollie Fingers League Leaders). And there, hidden amongst the doubles, triples, rogues and locked rows were actual single print stickers – 25 of them to be exact, including all five of the stickers from Pack 1. Amazing. Someone asked me today what my goal of this project was. I answered that I wanted to be able to hypothetically assemble an uncut sheet of stickers without knowing exactly where each sticker would have fit. And while that would be a neat exercise to actually do, the more I thought about individual box collation, pack cycles, and pack pockets, the more I realized that to make generalizations based a very small sample is at best unwise and at worst just plain stupid. I remember a few years ago when I started A Pack A Day, I ripped a box of 1989-90 Hoops Series One. I found that not only was the David Robinson draft-day rookie short print not actually short-printed, but I found that if you got it in a pack, you also got Larry Bird (I ended up getting about 4 of each from that one box). But while my experience tells me that the Robinson wasn't actually a short print, why is it always listed as a short print? Using my one-box example to make a generalization doesn't really work. There are reasons why card companies serial-number cards nowadays. For one thing, it creates a sense of a limited supply. For another thing, it completely destroys the idea of a general collation. Just because you get autographed relic card A doesn't mean you'll also get commons B, C, and D (well, unless the auto relics are considered Rogues, then that opens up whole new possibilities...). Of course, this is not true of regular card products. I'd bet that Topps 2010 has just as poor collation as Topps 1986. In any event, if you can view a Google doc, you can take a look at my documented collation from my box of 1982 Topps Stickers.
My hands keep working pretty well when I'm drinking. My ADHD mind is more problematic. I've tried to avoid this, largely because I think that according to whatever code of scribal ethics I do, or should, observe, it's reprehensible. Nonetheless — and this might well have summat to do with my having read about one of my literary heroes, W.H. Auden, sitting in a dive bar on St. Mark's Place sucking down the VSOP all day long, no doubt fending off propositions from Ginsberg, writing away. I can't do it. I believe I've made that clear. If I haven't, here's the dilly-o. My hands keep working pretty well when I'm drinking. My ADHD mind is more problematic. Of course, my mind is problematic in the best of situations. I sure as hell can't control it. So it's snowing here in Gotham. It would be an excellent night to find a nice ginmill and spend the rest of the evening consuming a pride of beers and a couple of packs of Marlboros. Except for (1) I don't smoke any more and (2) even if I did, you can't light up in bars here in the city. There were a couple of pints in the refrigerator when I got home from tai chi, and they went fast, so I had a couple more. All to the good. I can feel the universe narrowing, feel my interest in my own thoughts burgeoning, and feel the external noise fading away. The thirst is far from satisfied, amigos. But that's it for tonight. I know where I stand, and where I'd stand, or flop, if I had a couple more pints. Nowhere good, I assure you. The issue of creating, even on the abcedarian level at which I compose, and drinking is complex. It's like juggling sushi knives. One slip and you're not witty, you're exsanguinating. Remember the scene in Deer Hunter where Walken was playing Russian roulette? Not quite so severe, but a loss is a loss. So I'll be signing off now, chillin' like Bob Dylan. When I review this tomorrow, I may have more to say.
Sometime in December I decided to find out how long it would take to put together a set by simply buying wax packs. Of course, the holidays were fast approaching, so this became a project for after the madness passed. And now here we are. A few days ago, I put out a message on Facebook/Twitter asking for help: Which set should I put together? The choices were 1981 Fleer, 1990 Topps, 1991 Topps, 1992 Upper Deck, 1994 Fleer, and a random 1980s Topps sticker set. I got a lot of response, mostly choosing a sticker set (5 votes), 1981 Fleer (2 votes), or 1990 Topps (2 votes). After much deliberation, here's the set I'll be aiming to complete: 1982 Topps Stickers. I chose 1982 because of the availability of unopened sticker packs and unused sticker albums. After I complete the sticker album, I will attempt to complete 1991 Topps, a set I never liked and never bought when it came out. After 1991 Topps, who knows. Here are the rules: No trading. No buying of opened lots on eBay. I will only buy packs. I also plan on tracking sticker/card sequencing in packs. I will then fill in each page of the sticker album as best I can. I still haven't figured out what to do with the sticker doubles, but I think some sort of public art around Boston will be on tap.
Hi all, It's been a while since my last post as not much has changed, i am still managing on 12.5mg Methotrexate weekly and 75mg Diclofenac daily, my last blood tests showed that i am still anaemic with low ferritin levels (as i think ive said before i just cannot tolerate the iron (Ferrous Sulphate) tablets), so i am now waiting for a date to have another endoscopy to check for ulcers which i ain't looking forward to. My joints are not too bad at the moment on the lower Methotrexate dose although my skin is creeping up again. I hope everyone is bearing up and ok, all the best
In my view, this is a step in the wrong direction. The tax on so-called Cadillac health plans made sense as a way to reduce the existing tax incentive toward excessively generous health insurance, which in turn encourages excessive use of healthcare. That reform is, apparently, now gone. Instead, the current administration proposal is to increase the tax on capital income, reducing the incentive for saving and investment. In other words, the new proposal would do less to bend the curve of rising healthcare costs and more to impede long-run economic growth. This change was probably made to attract more House Democrats. It will likely make the plan even less attractive to congressional Republicans. By the way, according to CBO director Doug Elmendorf, the new administration proposal has too few details for the CBO to provide cost estimates. Perhaps more details will be available in the days to come.
Jane went to see the psychiatrist today with a friend. She wrote out an agenda of questions for discussion but he was bemused by it. He thought he ought to have all the answers but didn't have an answer to one of them. He seemed not to understand that they were points for discussion rather than direct questions of him. He was frightened that he didn't have the answers. He was even more frightened that he didn't understand the questions. Jane was yet even more frightened that he didn't understand the questions. He felt "got at" because of this ... but it was a genuine attempt to have a multi-disciplinary discussion. As the team leader, surely he should feel competent in this? Their ward rounds are described as multi-disciplinary team meetings. But he didn't feel confident. He could talk about medication, leave and risk assessments; anything else sent him into a panic or denial. Consultant psychiatrists in the NHS are not used to being questioned or having to substantiate what they are doing. They expect deference and in return do what the ward staff ask of them. It is four weeks since he suggested he wanted a second opinion for Sam. He has done nothing since then. When Jane discussed this with him he suggested a name for the second opinion. We have Googled him and he is an expert in "Schizophrenia", in medication and in treatment resistance. He has written papers about the additional medication that Sam's psychiatrist wants to introduce. What is the point in getting a true second opinion from someone whose background is such that they are almost certain to support what Sam's psychiatrist intended to do in the first place? We have been very polite with him so far. Perhaps it was good to have made him squirm a little today ... Though on previous occasions this has often had negative outcomes.
It's difficult enough for my ADHD brain to remember what I'm doing, let alone what five or six other mooks are up to. I was diligently studying Latin; OK, I was watching some tournament poker over the weekend when I realized that in a treating ADHD blog post last week I'd discussed the hardships an ADHDan faced when playing cards. My point was that given our ADHD impaired memories, we were at a gross disadvantage, since being able to recall the cards which had been played was critical to all but the most casual levels of gaming. True enough, but not the whole story. First of all, it's not just the cards that a good player remembers, but the other players. Poker players speak of a player having a "tell," some behavioral tic that he replicates in direct response to a given set of circumstances. For example, a player who's bluffing may sit there scratching at his ear, or drumming his fingers on the table (these are exceptionally overt mannerisms, but for our current purposes they'll serve). Given a good hand, the same player may sit as serenely as a lama, or carefully arrange his chips in even stacks. This information only comes from constant observation and analysis, watching the actions of one's competitors and linking them to the situation that eventually reveals itself. Like all data recording, the value of these observations increases in direct proportion to their quantity and accuracy. And then, of course, one has to remember this stuff. There's no benefit to an "AHA!" moment, the realization that another player has just moved his glasses to the top of his head, or has started to suck on an ice cube, unless you can recall what he held the last time he did so. I've come to terms with this, and that's why I don't play cards any more. It's difficult enough for me to remember what I'm doing, let alone what five or six other mooks are up to. And that's not even allowing for the possibility that they've totally fabricated a tell, and are planning on trotting it out, blatantly, at a critical moment, probably when you're trying to decide whether or not to go all-in. Sucker. PS: If don't think you have any tells, think again. All but the very best players exhibit them, and if you're reading this, Slick, you're certainly not in that category.
Jane decided to attend the ward round meeting earlier this week. We had been to the planning meeting only a couple of weeks earlier. But of course, yet again, things change so quickly that there is a need for a short term response and the longer term plan can be quickly forgotten. We wanted to emphasise our thanks to the staff for the fact that they were still being positive with Sam and with us while things have been difficult. Also we wanted to suggest that there needed to be a major input of some sort in terms of psychological and therapeutic support to try to get Sam over this blip. They started though by trying very hard to reassure Jane that they had no intentions of trying to move Sam elsewhere. Jane must have mentioned this. It is a real fear. It has happened everywhere else. They are so used to "improvement" in their behavioural sense with the possibility of patients moving on. When an initial improvement leads ultimately to further decline they are at a loss and eager to move him on before it becomes apparent or because they do not know want to do next. Sam is now on a forensic ward. Where does he go from here if they can't cope? But only a few weeks ago on Christmas Day Sam and the family enjoyed a lovely day together. So it can go well for him and us. How do we get back on the upward spiral? So they were trying hard to reassure Jane of this. Then they started to talk of medication. They see a need for change. They do not understand him. He seems to be outside their experience. Usually on Clozapine patients do so well ... Sam has been there for eighteen months now. This is the second time he has been on Clozapine. Both times he has been taken to hospital with physical health concerns. So what do they propose now? More psychological and therapeutic support? No ...
I had severe carpal tunnel syndrome and was headed straight under the knife, but truly didnt want surgewry...

I cant say this is the answer for everyone.. but it surely worked for me :) Best of luck to you friend!
Once your application gets to the hiring committee, the hope is that they've already heard of you. But if they haven't, hopefully they've heard of at least one of your letter writers. When we get applications, I typically first sort by whether I've heard of the applicant, then by the number of letter writers they have that I've heard of, then loosely by the reputation of their university. And I make my way down the list, not always all the way to the bottom. (Okay, I've only done this once, and I think I got about 90% of the way through.) In my experience, what we've looked for in applications is (a) a good research statement, including where you're going so as to distinguish yourself from your advisor, (b) a not-bad teaching statement (it's hard to get a job at a research university on a great teaching statement, but it's easy to lose an offer on a bad one... my feeling here is just to be concrete and not to pad it with BS -- if you don't have much to say, don't say much), (c) great letters, and (d) an impressive CV. You should expect that the hiring committee will read some of your papers before interviewing you. This means that if you have dozens, you should highlight somewhere (probably the research statement) what are they best ones that they should read. Otherwise they'll choose essentially randomly, and (depending on your publishing style) this could hurt. As always, put your best foot forward and make it easy for the hiring committee to find out what's so great about you. Anyway, that's basically it. There's lots more at interview stage, but these are my feelings for application stage. I'd be interested to hear if my characterization of the hiring process is vastly different than at other universities; plus, if there are other openings that might be relevant to NLP/ML folks, I'm sure people would be very pleased to seem them in the comments section. Good luck, all your graduating folks!
