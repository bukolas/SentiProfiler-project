Sky News September 15 @ 0645 Al Qaeda Leader Dies In US Helicopter Strike American special forces have killed a top al Qaeda militant in a helicopter assault on a car in Somalia. Kenyan-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, 28, was suspected of building the truck bomb that killed 15 people at a Kenyan hotel in 2002, as well as involvement on a botched missile launch at an Israeli airliner. A senior Somali government source said Nabhan was in a car with other foreign insurgents from the al Shabaab rebel group when they were hit near Roobow village in Barawe District, around 150 miles south of the capital Mogadishu. Washington says al Shabaab represents al Qaeda in Somalia. A Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to comment "on any alleged operation in Somalia". But it is understood that special forces aboard two helicopters that flew from a US Navy ship opened fired on the vehicle that they believed contained Nabhan. A total of four Somalis were killed while a Somali government source said Nabhan and four others died. Western security agencies say Somalia has become a safe haven for militants, including foreign jihadists, who use it to plot attacks in the region and beyond. Nabhan, who has long been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Most Wanted list, is believed to have fled to Somalia after the 2002 bombing of a Israeli-owned Kenyan beach hotel. He is believed to have owned the vehicle used in the attack on the hotel near Mombasa in 2002 that killed 15 people. He is also wanted by the FBI in connection with the missile attack on an Israeli airliner in Mombasa the same year. Some reports in US media say Nabhan was involved in the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which more than 250 died.
