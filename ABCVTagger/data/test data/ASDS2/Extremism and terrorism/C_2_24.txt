Sister Z, Quote: I dont get it! what are muslims getting into?? I though Hamas were muslims!! Not like Paki or iraqi secular but they were good muslims and no secular. they were against israel (and called terrorist) HAMAS was good at one time, and even today man Qassam fighters are good Muslims and considered Mujahideen insha'Allah. But they leadership is now a sell out. Please do not confuse today's HAMAS with the HAMAS of year gone by, the good old HAMAS would not make peace and carried out martyrdom raids, and now new HAMAS signs deals with kuffar and says martydom operations are haraam. The real HAMAS continues in the Salafi Mujahideen of Gaza.
