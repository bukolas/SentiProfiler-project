Since only a few Indian universities has met the international standards.Its a welcome decission from the govt. As a result our universities will have to face a tough competion for their survival which will raise the quality of our education substantially. And more of our students will get oppurtunity to acquire quality education without the need of going abroad.

but few concerns will be

Since ultimately people in India want quality of education be raised to be more competitive in this world till we are able to stannd on our knees. For that we would like a foregin help but after we stand we should be able to take the charge off. That dosent mean it should be Use & Throw policy.

my suggetions:

1. It shold be a treaty of more than policy or business.
2. It will be better to merge maximum number than letting to open new ones.


Since education will draw the future India.
