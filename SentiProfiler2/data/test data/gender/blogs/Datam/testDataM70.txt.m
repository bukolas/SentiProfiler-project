single coloured rainbow
Monday, 15 March 2010

you are no more, a vestige hanging in the corners 
of my consciousness. the scent of joy was nothing 
but illusion never existed, a conjuration for oasis 
in storms of desperation. the smile you hung on 
your face, a perfect portrait upon flawless wall; 
like scabbard concealed the ugliness of your soul.

It was not until much later during the day that I realised the irony of the title and my predicament. It had not occurred to when I was drinking my favourite four espresso shots ice vanilla latte, on a sunny (to much subjectivity in British terms) Saturday afternoon in my local Starbucks that my colleagues in all the tiresome complexities of office politics, and guy-girl hormones; would perhaps assume, and most definitely make fine gossip of obsession or crush over a Norwegian girl who had just joined the team earlier this week.

It would perhaps, be pathetic and immature to even remotely suggest that any regular decent gentleman (or ruffian) would not be objectively attracted to our new colleague. She, is in fact one of the more attractive people I've had the pleasure to know in my miserable life. I did, perhaps was overly nice to her; but it is part of my nature to all new colleagues. I suppose they would assume I were gay if our new colleague were a guy? My first impression of her was, astonishingly; fear. I am afraid my incompetency in word-smiting cannot adequately describe the emotional stress that bombarded me that day, warning signals flaring in my mind with 'stay away', and 'run'; only to be saved on the grateful knowledge she is engaged. It was a confirmation that I have indeed become caligynephobic.

If there were any women involved in the purchase of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood, it would be from Ireland; not of obsession or crush, but of high opinion on taste. I was not disappointed, and the book was indeed a page turner and it took me a considerable deal of will and with a tiny extra push of my realization of the irony of the title; of one or perhaps four too many of in this sentence.

I would perhaps on a later date write a review when I finish the book, and to which this book will be annoying to carry about in all the unholy opinions that would consult the minds of my colleagues when I carry it in the morning Monday, or should I saw MÃ¥ndag.

So I lit the fire a fire, isn't it good, Norwegian Wood?
