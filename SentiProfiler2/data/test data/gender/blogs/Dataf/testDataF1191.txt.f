Part of the Spanish army came to the Chapala Valley and surrounding area. They were led by Don Alonso de Avalos who arived in 1531 and set up the province of 'Avalos' which included Tuxpan, Tuzantla, Sayula and Sahuayo. The Spaniards also converted the native peoples to Christianity. Beginning in 1545, a large influx of Spaniards arrived in the area and began to exploit the natural resources of the area. In 1567 the Marquis de Folces turned much of the land into large cattle farms. By the end of the 16th century much of the area was monopolised by the Hacienda de Guaracha.
