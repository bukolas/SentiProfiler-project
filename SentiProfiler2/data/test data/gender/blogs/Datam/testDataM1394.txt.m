When God made Steffi... he gave her, probably the best SMILE!!! Smiling Beauty! Havenâ€™t met her still! Waiting for that day! Met her first exactly 365 days back in this same place~~ Thanx to Orkut! She started off by asking me not to snoop around her profile but now we ended up being the bestest of friends!
Loyalty, childishness, bubliness and sense of humour are her trademark!
They say Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you always know they are there. She is just like that!
She values and treasures her friend much more than her life! And not to forget her craze for Suriya! An ardent fan, she is! All the time going gaga over suriya!
She loves her sister to the core and her CASPER! Just the kid, as she is, still at heart!
You would know the value of true friendship when you are with her. Great to have a friend like YOU dear! Here is to the 100 more years of friendship and fun! Cheers! God Bless you!
