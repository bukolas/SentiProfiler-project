There was a time early on in my days where I could jump out of bed and greet the world with tremendous vigor. There was a time early on in my life where my memory was sharp and clear. Now I get out of bed gently, slowly and greet the world with “oh shit, my back”. My memory loss is apparent whenever I meet someone for the first time and they give me their name, only for me to forget it 10 seconds into the conversation. Good Times……..good times.
