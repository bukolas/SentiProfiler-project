This first day of school is a little different than the dozens of others I've experienced. Winter 2008 marks the first semester that I start the advertising major at BYU, and it feels good to finally have a focus in school. Today has been a day mostly of standing in lines for various reasons, but I did manage to get some required reading in for my marketing research class. So far, the text has not lived up to its price ($153.) My first class starts in about an hour, goes for about 2.5 hours, then I have the wonderful commute back to the salt lake valley after that.
