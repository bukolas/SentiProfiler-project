I use to belong to quite of few different backs and one of them was bank of america...i had so many problems with them it came to the point my money was starting to get missing!  Thats when I had to go down there and find out whats going on and close my account immediatly and opened up with Wachovia!  Ever since I opened up with Wachovia Back never had a problem with my money, checks, atm card, and ect.
