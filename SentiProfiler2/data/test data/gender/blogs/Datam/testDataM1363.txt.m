There are two ways you and your spouse can separate: either with an informal separation or by a formal legal separation. An informal separation is basically whatever the two of you agree it to be. Typically, one of you stays in the home you had previously shared, and the other moves into some other quarters. At this stage you normally wouldn't make any formal property division, but you would agree, informally, on some kind of working arrangement about possession of things like cars, the bank accounts, the credit cards, and the stereo.
