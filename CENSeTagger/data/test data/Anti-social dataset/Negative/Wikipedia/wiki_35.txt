The Center includes private rooms equipped with showers and flat-screen TVs, as well as either a couch or reclining chair that converts to a bed. The expansion added 24 intensive care unit beds on the second level and 66 monitored (med/surge) beds on the 4th and 5th levels. More than two-thirds of the hospital's acute-care beds are private. This expansion will enable Sharp Grossmont to serve an estimated 100,000 emergency patients annually and will help reduce wait times in the emergency room.
