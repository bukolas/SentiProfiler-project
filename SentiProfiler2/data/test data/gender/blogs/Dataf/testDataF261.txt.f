Arthritis sucks! Does anybody want to 2nd my motion? In recent months, I've heard chatter within my circle, about the importance of exercising and taking care of ourselves because we're approaching the age where health concerns become real. Hearing family and friends discuss cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease and fatty livers, made me realize, I'm not exempt and have a responsibility to take care of myself. Knowing my body, limitations and capabilities, I came up with a walking plan to get myself into better shape with the hopes of avoiding future problems with my general health. The first two days were relatively easy and while I felt I'd actually made progress, I didn't feel as though I was challenging myself physically. On the third day, I slightly bumped it up a notch (extreme emphasis on the word, slightly). Increasing my speed just a little, for a short period of time, gave me a greater sense of accomplishment and the feeling of a better workout. Stepping off of the treadmill, I felt great, as if I'd ran and won a marathon (against snails mind you, but nevertheless, I did it!). Feeling good about myself, I walked away from the treadmill, humming the Rocky theme song.
