My wife and I were thrilled that a few friends recommended we try out Coast. Easily accessible from 90/94, there was no corkage fee for the bottle of wine we brought in and the sushi was excellent. Highly recommend the Sunshine and Volcano rolls in addition to the Hamachi/Jalapeno. Also a huge fan of their spicy miso soup and spinach appetizers. We're going to make this at least a biweekly outing.
