I agree. No one has the right to tell you what to do, how to do things. Anything we do or say, ppl will criticize. What you do right might be wrong to someone else, hence criticism is constantly alive. I would channel those criticize into positive advice and keep your ear opens. Don't shut out these criticism. Criticism is a way of seeing yourself in a different perspective. And I feel twitter, blogging has given the celebrities (singers, actors) a whole new medium to connect to their fans. I'm glad they are doing it. Because I wouldn't be able to praise Shahrukh Khan about his latest movie if it wasn't for him being in Twitter or I wouldn't be able to tell you how much I loved your " O Aiiye" song from Ayan.
