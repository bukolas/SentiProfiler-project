Lakshmi a.k.a motorrrrr..the world's greatest talking machine...she can talk-talk-talk like
forever..i think she talks even when shez asleep..get her started and u'll find tht u wudnt have
spoken a word in the convo..amazzinggg talent..she cant beat anyone hands down!..
With that never ending talk comes the laughter part..again..she can't stop laughing..she laughs even for the most idiotic jokes and its real tough to stop her..but once she stops,she'll start talking again.. argghhh!!makes u wonder whr tht mouth came from..
Barring all tht.. shez a fantastic person.. real friendly and has an ultra positive perspective towards life..very bold considering all the things shez been thro.. shez also brilliant in studies and a master of the "memory mapping" technique..fun loving,trustworthy(who says she cant keep secrets?!),caring,gregarious,level-headed and damn helpful.. she never takes things to heart despite being the butt of all our jokes..
Thanks for being a great pal!! "motorr" rocks!!
