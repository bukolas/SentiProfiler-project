After work, I met Cathy and the rest of the ridesharers for a quick jaunt to Montreal in the back of Cathy's black Suzuki SUV.

As soon as I got there, I called Marilyn, when I meant to call Marc-Andre. I had a mission to find some chocolate that had been left there for me by a couchsurfer of mine.

She cancelled on me, felt bad, so she left some chocolate for me to pick up.

Long story short, I never found the chocolate. Marilyn was home, and I sat waiting for the bus to her house for at least 45 minutes.

That was OK, because then I left with some French girls to go drink a beer before heading off to Boston.

We had a nice time, and then I walked to the bus station to catch my bus.

I tried to sleep all the way to Boston, but I couldn't because a man from Vermont sat beside me and SQUISHED various parts of my body as he tried to get comfortable using my arm and leg as a pillow. Nevertheless, I finally got to Boston at about 8 a.m., then I got changed, and made my way to Smarter Travel.

I had an interesting meeting people at the office, I brought some maple toffee and they seemed to enjoy it.

I met up with Ed Passarella to talk about perhaps switching jobs, although nothing was available just yet, I think he was happy I visited anyway.

There might be something interesting for me to do in the future though, stay tuned. It was Graham's idea to do a travel gadget exchange, and the ladies at STM found this out, so they kitted me out with a giant box of travel gadget crap to give away. They were more than happy to part with it.

There were a bunch of seat cushions, lots of pointless plastic stuff that hopefully people would at least laugh at. 

And they did.

I was pooped and WAY too early so I kind of passed out at a table. A very blue-collar-obviously-just-finished-work kinda guy was eating pizza and after he finished he came over and asked me what was in the box.

"Oh it's just junk I'm giving away to people when they come."

"What are ya sellin' somethin'?!"
