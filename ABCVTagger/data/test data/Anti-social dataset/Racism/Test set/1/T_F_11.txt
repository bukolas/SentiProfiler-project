"there are two ways which might have led to a liberation of europe from the jews : explusion or extermination! both methods have been tried over the course of centurys, but they were never carried to a conclusion.... let us make a new begining today so that we can annihilate the jew."in the infamous words of Julius Streicher.im not going to deny the fact the holocast happened but im not saying it didn't but i look at it as the greatest thing that man has ever acomplished i would like to see another one as a matter of fact {or a first one depending wether or not you think it happened}i think that america joined the wrong side of the war i also think that its not your fault you have your feelings but it was the lies you were raised with that make you feel that way and when the rest of the world learns the truth i hope you change your veiws

thats all for now

later
