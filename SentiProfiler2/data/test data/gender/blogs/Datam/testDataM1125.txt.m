Black and white does not scare us. It’s the grey things that are scary. They are the ones that defy classification. They are the ones you want to classify as white, yet in your heart you know they could as well be black. What happened that day was a gray thing, a dark gray thing if you will. My native place is Paravaicheri which is a village about 50 Km south of Chennai. Almost every weekend I used to take a bus from Koyambedu bus stand at about 8 PM. I would reach my village at about 9 30 PM. I had to walk 2 km from the high way to reach my house. I had lived in the village for most of my life, till I came to Chennai to join college. I got a job in Chennai after finishing college. So effectively for almost four and half years I had undertaken this journey almost every weekend and there had never been any event of significance save for a couple of bus breakdowns. So that day, as I boarded the bus late at 9 PM, surprised to find it so empty, I had no reason to doubt that my journey was going to be any different this time. There were hardly seven people in the bus including the conductor and driver. I put on my headset and started listening to songs on my Sony Ericcson.  Two men who were sitting two rows ahead of me were conversing about whether or not the world will end in 2012. I increased the volume in my phone to tune out their voices. I closed my eyes after setting alarm for 10 PM. The constant roaring of the engine served as a perfect lullaby as I dozed off within five minutes, oblivious of the impending nightmare. I woke up with a disturbed feeling after ten minutes. I blinked. The interior of the bus was dark. And I noticed the glowing letters in the panel behind the driver:  I was amused that I had not noticed it before. It was pitch dark outside and it beat me why they would want to switch off the lights inside the bus. I saw that the two people in the seats two rows ahead of me were still. The rhythmic sound of the engine sounded lonelier than silence. I turned back to see the conductor and was shocked to see that he was in the seat behind me and his eyes were fixed on me and there was a smile pasted in his face. Yes, it was pasted because it did not grow or fade in intensity.  “Why are the lights switched off?” He did not seem to have heard me though I spoke from the seat in front of his. He kept staring into my eyes, his lips frozen in an eternal smile. There were green fields on either side of the road for as far as I could see. The green was barely visible in the moonlight though and The only light in the road was the bus’s head lights and the highway seemed to be deserted and no other vehicle passed in either direction. I looked out through the window and noticed there were no lights on the road either. I did not remember such a long stretch in the road without lights. And it was then that I noticed that the bus was going through a street, a muddy path and not a tar road. Now I would have definitely noticed it in all the years of travel.  “This bus goes to Thindivanam right?” I asked in panic. And I turned to see the conductor still smiling at me with resolve. I did not understand whether he was trying to be funny or something was wrong. I simply stood up and went up to the two people sitting two rows ahead of me. In the darkness of the bus, I could not see their face. I asked them the same question. One of them looked up. I took out my mobile phone to shine the light on him, but found it had switched off.   “Tell me a number between one and ten.” He said.  I blinked assuming I had heard him wrong.   “No. I was asking about the bus. Where does it go? I thought it went to Thindivanam.”  “Tell me a number between one and ten.” He repeated and every intonation in the sentence sounded just like it had when he asked the previous time. I kept looking at him wondering if he had teamed up with the conductor to play a prank on me. 
When he repeated the same sentence with exact same intonation of the syllables, I knew this wasn’t normal.
