I instantly liked the mall. Some of the stores were located outdoors and not everything was housed in a giant air-conditioned building. It was modern with a provincial touch that made the ambiance friendlier than the ones we have in the capital. There was an al fresco area, but I think the mall has developed over the years since the first time I was there. I was glad I had that extra time with my friend because the day after, the workshop participants, including colleagues from our national office, started arriving. One of our hosts brought us for dinner at a steak house. The restaurant was dimly lit and cozy with a Western feel, which, for a moment, made me forget that I was in the Philippines. The dinner was sumptuous and we all had our fill.
