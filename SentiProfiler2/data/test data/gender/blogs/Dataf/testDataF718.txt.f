I have made coffee with everything from Bunns to pots boiling on the top of the stove, but the Capresso is the only Coffee Maker that gives me true and well flavored coffee exactly as I want it to taste. The whole thing is done in a flash with minimal work on my part and it is ready before you know it. Setting the timer the night before, I know that in the morning I will have a fresh pot of coffee sitting there waiting for me, just the right flavor and just the right temporature. I pour a cup and savor the flavor of the best coffee ever made in this house.
