So then I'm a swan flying off into the sky and then the credits pop up...I never watch credits because I'm hardly ever interested in the actor...I'm more interested in the character that they played...but Bobbin had an interesting voice actor, so I watched the credits to see who voiced him (a one-hit wonder, I guess). And ka-pow there he is (I mean Card of course) right there on the screen. Script something or other...it was really cool...because I was thinking of him before and then there he was...like a dream come true...or something like that.
