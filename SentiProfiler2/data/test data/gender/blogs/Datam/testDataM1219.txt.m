Halloween was so fun. Camden was Wolverine, AJ was a witch, Dilyn was a skeleton, and Austin and me went as the Beauty and the Beast. Guess who was who? lol. We started out going to bri's where she made the most amazing assortment of soups and the cutes little bread soup bowls that looked like pumpkins. Don and Vicci and Maretta and Madison. It was a lot of fun. we did a bit of trick or treating with Bridger, and Madison and then we went up to our neighborhood and went around the block, Camden and Aj about two houses were needing to go potty but they didn't want to leave their goal of getting candy so they did the potty dance as they waited at each door! haha! I tried to get a video on my phone but it was getting too dark and the people always opened the door right before i got it going... but it was dang funny! after we got home I hurried and got the kids bathed and Camden asked to hand out candy I think he was more excited about handing out candy than going to get candy! Camden would go look out the blinds and start hollering that the kids were coming then he'd run and grab the candy bowl and stand in front of the door.... after about 5 seconds he would set the bowl down and run back to the blinds and peek out to see where the kids were at.... then run back to the door stand infront of the front door and again wait till they did the door bell! it was quite entertaining! at one point we got some "bigger kids" and Aj looks at them and says your a "big kid" haha! the boys started laughing and he said "yup" it was a good night and lots of fun!
