You've heard the expression "I've had it up to here (hand parallel to the earth while levitating your hand in front of yer brow)"  It is like we are a vessel that holds negativity, and when there is too much, we overfill and...then... we just plain lose ourselves.   But when positive hits us, the vessel drains.  When I see the level lower, I know that sometime ahead, negative will inevitably be on a future path.  But why let that inevitability lessen the positive?  Savour the great moments, and be prepared to not give the full value of what future negative intends for you.

"If one person can't make a difference, then why does it only take one person to ruin things for everyone else???"
