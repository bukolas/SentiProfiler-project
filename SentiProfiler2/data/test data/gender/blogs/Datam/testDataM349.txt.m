I'm trying to find a balance between sharing my ADHD experience in a blog and putting too much personal information out there in the digital world. Yogi Berra, the Sage of the Grand Concourse, the omphaloskeptic Neapolitan, once said, "When you come to a fork in the road, you should take it." I haven't a clue how one would accomplish that, but I am at a fork in the road. The blame for my erratic blog submissions to ADDitude can be laid on several doorsteps: my innate laziness, my inability to manage my time with any dexterity or consistency, even, mirable dictu, my very affliction with The Deficit. But issues of privacy and modesty, or shame, loom larger and larger. While I'm interested in the whole panorama of the ADHD experience, I find that doing research on the latest ADHD meds or a controversial diet plan is less attractive than looking inward, trying to figure out how the affliction has affected my life, how it interacts with my other shortcomings, and what if anything I can do about it. In addition, I have been told that the postings in which I'm talking about myself, my emotional condition, my constant, one would like to say Homeric, battles with depression and insolvency, attract more readers and more comments than anything I might write about the color of the new Concerta formulations (less, for all the relative frivolity, than the issue of whether there should be blue M&Ms, for example.) But there's a point where I don't want to write about myself. Or, more accurately, want to but feel uncomfortable. After all, I'm sure you're all very nice, concerned, ethical folks. I'm sure the snickering I hear is generated in my own head, and not in yours. But self-revelation has a price, especially in this age where privacy has, for all intents and purposes, become a rare, perhaps non-existent commodity. So I'll continue to try to find a balance between my personal situations and my obligations to my ADHD blog, and if I find it necessary to lie a little here and there, so be it. None of you will ever know the difference, except for a handful of people who know me personally, and, for the most part, I've managed to alienate them sufficiently that they don't care. I'm just sayin', you know?
