I’m Ellie, a 30 something mum of two beautiful little people, Big E aged 3 & Little E aged 9 months, and wife to my long suffering husband Mr H.

We live in the UK in somewhere Yorkshire.

I’m currently on the last few weeks of my maternity leave, and am loving being a second time mum, although no-one told me it’d be this much like hard work. They’re worth every sleepless night!

I’m an ‘experimental’ cook and Jamie Oliver fan (if you haven’t got his Ministry of Food book go get it!), love reading but don’t get much chance, which is probably a good thing as I currently have the concentration span of a potato. I’m also enjoying trying my hand at writing (’tis quite cathartic you know), I’m Twitter addicted and love, love, love blogging.

I used to paint in a former life when I was an art student (my favourite artist is Degas) and randomly took up knitting when I was pregnant with Little E (I’m actually quite good!).
