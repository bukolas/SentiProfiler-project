My name is Ryan. I like snowboarding, hiking, hunting, fishing... well anything that is outdoors. I am pretty straight forward. If i am thinking something i am going to tell you. I joined the military back in march and currently doing job training for the next year. I love what my job is in the military. Thats all i can say about that. If there is anything else you want to know about me just ask. Who I'd like to meet:
I have all the people in my life now that i want. I just wish i could be closer to all of them.
