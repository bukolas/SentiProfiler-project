After a great weekend spent with old high school friends and our return to church Sunday it definitely made today very depressing. No matter how old I get I always keep wishing the weekends will never end. Maybe it was the perfect family day we all shared yesterday planting our spring flowers ending that got me in this funk. Or maybe being unemployed now for 2 and half months is really starting to take its toll on me. However I still applied for a position with USPS this morning but who knows where that will go. I was also thinking about going back to school but still undecided. So basically my day consisted of spacing out and not really spending anytime with Alora. That will be different tomorrow I promise. I was so out of it I didn't even workout today, that really screws up my weekly schedule trust me.
Holly arrived home around 3pm and was obviously in a funk like me because we butted heads almost immediately. She ended up going to the store to cool off while I took my cellphone apart. Stupid fight really so making up when she returned was easy. I ended up firing up the BBQ and cooked us a really good dinner. The family's sleeping already as I write this and I'm finishing up the Lakers game. So I guess today didn't turn out to bad now that I think of it. Should get up early tomorrow and head over to the Vitamin Shoppe for some needed supplements. Maybe I will make it up to Alora and take the dog and her to the park. Lakers win!
