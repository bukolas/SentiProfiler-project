Every Valentine's Day I am alone.  
Alone.
Yeah, let that sink in. Feel the weight of it....

Now that you sufficiently feel bad for me, and want to lavish me with words of adoration, dozens of roses, and diamonds (they are a girl's best friend), I will ask you to hold all tokens of affection because I already have more than a gal could ever ask..... I have you. Yes, You. 

I have all of you wonderful readers and people to read. You allow me into your minds and your hearts; soooo many interesting places. I also have me. Me is pretty awesome, so why should I bemoan this wretched day? I know, it's insanity.... I'm far too amazing to spend hating one day of the year. So, I decided that this year, I am my own Valentine and I have also picked from some of the awesomeness on here to be my Valentine's as well. Strictly singles though. Yes, I do <3 many on here who are married, but this one day of the year married already have what we single are possibly searching for, so I must withhold my love for this single day. Forgive me marries. 

Tomorrow if the weather permits, and I pray it does, I'll be getting two more tattoos as my Valentine's/100 lbs lost gift to myself. And, my suggestion is that all of us do something nice for ourselves. We deserve it.
Now on to my Valentine's. A collection of awesomeness that defies the laws of gravity, or is that the laws of attraction? Either way, go to these people and shower them with the love and worship they deserve.
