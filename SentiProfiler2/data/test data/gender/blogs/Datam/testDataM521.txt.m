This afternoon the fun will begin with an anticipated Congressional Budget Office score followed by a House Budget Committee markup of the reconciliation amendments that will become the shell that the Senate bill will be added to as an amendment. Presumably, as soon as they're done Chairman Spratt will go to the floor. As a privileged piece of legislation, he must deliver it directly to the floor where it'll be numbered and reported out. Under House rules, the report takes two calendar days before it can be referred to the Rules Committee.The House Democratic caucus meets as Dems whip for votes.
