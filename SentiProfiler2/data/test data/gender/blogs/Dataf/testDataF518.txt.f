i think its because he's piscean.. or maybe because he refuses to touch coffee and made me drop my addiction too (:D) .. or the fact that he lives on an 8th floor apartment with the most stunning view of the city.. or coz he sings so well..
it could even be coz he's one brainy dude who doesnt show it.. or his "anyaaya" enthusiasm for life and all its quirks.. maybe its because he prefers public buses to driving around in his zen,.. or that undying nature to flirt ... maybe its the way he seems to say everything that i want to, a minute before i actually say it .. lolz..
maybe its coz he's one big contradiction when it comes to the topic of tradition and modernity...
maybe its that contagious laugh.. maybe its his love for the "gaads" :) .. or that fact that he's totally like me.. or any number of things. i dont care really.
just take it from me for granted.. shiv's
one great friend... THIS guy, u definitley want to meet :)
