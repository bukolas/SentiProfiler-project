I havent written in a while and just gave this link to a friend and realized how long it's been since I've posted something on here. I love to write but sometimes I get tired of talking about my illness, you know the cheesy line, "I have Achalasia but Achalsia doesn't have me" well, sometimes it takes over and I get overwhelmed with the drama of it, which now that I think of it, is somewhat selfish, at least blogwise. I have new readers and haven't kept up with what I've learned about the disorder or what's new about it. Im going to do some research tonight. I don't want my fellow achalasia suffers to feel alone and I don't want to feel like I am the only one in the world with this disorder
