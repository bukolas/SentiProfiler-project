I have lived in Japan for 8 months.

EIGHT MONTHS!

At times, this is unbelievable. I still feel like a newbie. A guest. and somehow, i think, i will always feel this way. in fact, i accept that this status will not change. being a guest, does have its priviledges.

In everyday life, i have become pretty independent. I can shop, dine, carry out simple bank, postal, phone transactions without a problem. Yet. I will always be dependent on others. and maybe, just maybe, that might be a good thing. This way, i get to interact with others more.

While I think i have grown as a person, this has somewhat plateau-ed and I have reverted back to some of my bad habits. I sleep no earlier than 12 these days, i watch more dramas than before, i procrastinate- ALOT.

The trip back to Singapore has made me re-evaluate my priorities. Its prompt interruption of my routine has made me take a step back and think, once more, of why I am here. and why i want to stay one more year. Going back made me realise that time and tide waits for no man. Everyone had changed, just a little, if not in personality then in circumstances, in relationships, in dressing, in habits. I have changed too. but is it for the better?

So on the plane back, I thought about it. It didn’t have to be amazing acheivements. It just had to be something I would follow through with. and i came up with these

1) Learn enough Japanese (at least up to JLPT 3)
2) Update my blog
3) Upload my photos
4) Be myself. Don’t accommodate too much
5) Cook more interesting food (and not so frequently)
6) Exercise more
7) Sleep by 11
8) Make more friends
9) Take more pictures
10) Think about my future
