On April 11th, a show that may well end up being the next great television drama will debut on HBO. I have written about Treme in the past, but in case you have not paid attention, here is the dealio: Treme, named after the Faubourg Tremé neighborhood in the French Quarter, is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and looks at the situation through the eyes of the jazz musicians. The cast is damn impressive and features Simon vets Mellisa Leo ( Det. Sgt. Kay Howard in Homicide: Life on the Streets), The Wire's Clarke Peters (THE WIRE), Wendell Pierce (Also from THE WIRE) and Khandi Alexander (THE CORNER) as well as John Goodman, Steve Zahn and Kim Dickens. Here is the new trailer to get you ready. Trailer With season one barely over, word comes that there will be a change in the cast for season two. Marsha Thomason will be returning as FBI agent Diana Lancing, the character she played in the series pilot. Marsha has previously appeared on LOST and LAS VEGAS. As she comes, Natalie Morales will be leaving. Natalie played agent Lauren Cruz in throughout the season, but often in a minor capacity. Natalie will be staying within the NBC/Uni family as she joins the NBC comedy PARKS AND RECREATION. Season two begins this summer. Good news for fans of Victor Gischler : Director Sean Byrne is on board for the planned film of of the very cool GO-GO GIRLS OF THE APOCALYPSE. Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world. Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse begins nine years later, when he emerges into a bizarre landscape filled with hollow reminders of an America that no longer exists. The highways are lined with abandoned automobiles; electricity is generated by indentured servants pedaling stationary bicycles. What little civilization remains revolves around Joey Armageddon's Sassy A-Go-Go strip clubs, where the beer is cold, the lap dancers are hot, and the bouncers are armed with M16s. Accompanied by his cowboy sidekick Buffalo Bill, the gorgeous stripper Sheila, and the mountain man Ted, Mortimer journeys to the lost city of Atlanta -- and a showdown that might determine the fate of humanity. Byrnes'feature film debut, THE LOVED ONES, won the Midnight Madness Audience Award at the Toronto Film Festival and generated quite a buzz in the film world. Prior to THE LOVED ONES, he directed a number of shorts and has been compared to a young Sam Rami. That is a hell of a compliment. Check out this interview with Twitch.com . I have always enjoyed Victor's work, but GO-GO GIRLS rocked mightily and was one of my favorite books of 2008. It kicks ass and is a lot of fun. If you have not picked it up, do yourself a favor and get a copy right now! HBO has announced that season three of TRUE BLOOD will begin SUNDAY, JUNE 13 at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT). Mill Creek Entertainment Release date: March 9, 2010 MSRP: $14.98 Runtime: 20 episodes, 720 minutes, 4 discs Silk Stalkings is another Stephen J. Cannell-created series previously released on DVD by Anchor Bay, discontinued, and now re-released by Mill Creek. First aired in 1991 as part of CBS's Crimetime After Primetime lineup, the show focused on two partners in the West Palm Beach, Florida PD assigned to sexually-based crimes of passion. As its timeslot and title suggest, the show was more risqu&eacute; than much of network TV at the time, but seems tame compared to today's fare. While there was a lot of flash, co-stars Mitzi Kapture and Rob Estes had more substance in their performances than you might expect. Kapture's Rita Lee Lance was beautiful, but also driven by a brain aneurysm that plagued her with headaches and threatened to burst anytime. Estes's Chris Lorenzo was more casual on the surface, but a dependable partner and friend to Rita. Both actors could pull off the show's mix of saucy and serious dialogue. When Crimetime After Primetime was cancelled in 1993, Silk Stalkings moved to USA Network, where it ran until 1999 with new partners rotating in a la Law &amp; Order—a testament to the strength of its premise. I have a soft spot for first seasons and enjoyed revisiting the show as first conceived. The first season also features Ben Vereen as Chris and Rita's captain and Danny Gans as medical examiner Roger. This set has no extras and is packaged in inconvenient, flimsy paper-and-cellophane sleeves, but as with all Mill Creek sets, the $14.98 price is the real draw. --Gerald So With just a month to go before shooting, the cast for MILDRED PIERCE is starting to fill out. With more names coming out this last week, I thought this would be a good time to take a look at who is who so far: Kate Winslet: The title character. Mildred Pierce had gorgeous legs, a way with a skillet, and a bone-deep core of toughness. She used those attributes to survive a divorce and poverty and to claw her way out of the lower middle class. But Mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter. (Joan Crawford in the original). Do I really need to talk about Kate? Evan Rachel Wood: Veda, the aforementioned monstrous daughter. Despite Mildred's attempts to provide a better life for her, Vera wants more and will do almost anything to get what she feels she deserves. (Ann Blyth). Wood played Rourke's daughter in THE WRESTLER and was quite good in THE UPSIDE OF ANGER. Guy Pearce: Monte Beragon, the wealthy playboy that eventually becomes Mildred's second husband. Almost immediately, we learn that things don't end too well for him. (Zachary Scott). Pearce is best known for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and MEMENTO and recently appeared in THE HURT LOCKER. Brian F. O'Byrne: Bert Pierce, Mildred's first husbamd, after he loses his job, Mildred leaves in hopes of finding a better life (Bruce Bennett). O'Bryne can currently be seen as Aaron Stark on FlashForward and was Colin on BROTHERHOOD. James LeGros: Wally Fay, Bert's former business partner (Jack Carson). LeGros was recently seen as Dr. Dan Harris in MERCY and also had regular roles in ALLY MCBEAL and SLEEPER CELL. He also played Raylan Givens in Elmore Leonard's PRONTO on Showtime. Melissa Leo is Ida Corwin, Mildred's friend (Eve Arden). Leo was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in FROZEN RIVER and will be in the upcoming David Simon series TREME on HBO. Morgan Turner: Veda, younger but still a wretched creature. Todd Haynes co-wrote the screenplay and will be directing. He wrote and directed 2002's acclaimed FAR FROM HEAVEN (which got him an Oscar nomination). I want to open this up with the disclosure that I am not a fan of the Stargate franchise. I'm not saying I don't like, I'm saying I don't know it or watch it. I saw the original movie and really enjoyed it. I've seen a few episodes of the two show, Stargate and Stargate Atlantis and it didn't really move me one way or the other. Another Sci Fi show to watch to kill time in a pleasant enough way. Ol' Jeremy asked if I was interested in this and the name Robert Carlyle got my attention. I'll watch anything he does, and so far I've enjoyed all his work. So, quick Stargate rundown. Mankind discover gateways to other worlds put here by a group they call the Ancients. Being mankind we start to explore going to other worlds. Now you know all you need to to watch this. A group called Icarus is on a planet with a very powerful gate. To access an as yet unreachable destination they need help cracking a code. They recruit a genius who lives with Mom and plays video games all day. They crack the code just as the location of the group is under attack. Most people shoot to a ship and back to earth, however a smaller group of civilians and military go through the gateway and land a ship called the Destiny. New mission, find a way home. They can communicate with Earth through tech originating with the Ancients that lets them swap bodies, however they are mostly on their own. They need to find food and water and keep the ship running. Carlyle plays a scientist(Dr, Nicholas Rush) who is obsessed with the ship and really cares about nothing else. Elli Wallace is the young genius who is just fascinated by it all, but also the most interesting as he is not influenced by either faction wanting to control the tech. Everett Yong is in charge, but it's shaky at best. Minng Na plays a human resources person who is representing an oversight group with their own agendas. other layers include various military and civilan folks who work together to try and get home. Lou Diamond Phillips is a Colnol Telford who was supposed to be in charge of a team ready for this mission instead of the rag tag team actually on the ship. He adds a wonderful dynamic to the cast. Even Richard Dean Anderson from the original series has a role here and it really ties it together nicely. I love the cast with one exception. Ming Na is a crappy actress. I couldn't stand her on ER and I don't like her here. She over does movements and facial expressions and always looks pissed off. All the other people on the show seem natural in their roles, she seems to over think it and it feels false. I hope they kill her off in a nasty fashion. They even added a lesbian element to her character which really does nothing other than try to be hip. Kill her off. Other than that one character I love this show. It has elements of various other sci fi things I've seen and enjoyed but it is also very character driven and well plotted. Whether you are a fan of Stargate or not I think this is a shoe worth checking out. Season 1.0 was a lot of fun and the DVD set was over faster than I would have liked. I'll be watching all the rest as soon as they come out. So end result: I love everything about the show except for one actress. I recommend this. Buy Stargate SG-U: 1.0 Season 1.5 comes back on the air April 2nd. When I heard the news that the cast was changing I was mad. I love Vincent D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe on the show and after 8 seasons i want more. I questioned what the Hell they were thinking. I've seen the first two episodes of Season 9 and I have to say the send off was perfect. LOYALTY part one and two were really something special and on the strength of these two episodes I think the show will still be a favorite. Something weird is going on with their Captain (Eric Bogosian) and Goren and Eames are not going to let it it sit. Before long things get crazy with the international implications, FBI and the upper brass in NYPD all tangling things up. I don't want to give anything away plot wise, but the title of the shows, LOYALTY is right on. Goldblum is great, I like his new partner played by Saffron Burrows (Boston Legal) a lot as the new Detective from Chicago. Don't worry, it looks ike Law and Order Criminal Intent will still be a great show, and I for one, can't wait to keep watching. Look for it on TUESDAY March 30th on USA Network
