We went to an outdoor Symphony presentation of the BBC Blue Planet. The Fine Arts Museum has a hillside that provides near perfect seating for such an event. And it only rained enough to cause them to pass out free raincoats (flimsy but effective), not to get soaked.......

A friend Ken Elder passed away...one more farewell gathering missed while in Taiwan.

We drove, well Melissa did, we rode, to Taichung to support a fundraiser and visit some friends that teach at Morrison Academy who Melissa went to Russia with in 1994. Yep THAT long ago!

About 2/3 of the way there Melissa's car overheated. We stopped at a rest stop. Store, gas station and restrooms. (90 urinals)! Once we added 2 liters of water and the engine cooled some off we went. WELL about 20 minutes later we pulled over and (short version) rode in the car on the back of a flat bed tow truck into the next city to get a new thermostat and radiator. Sunday morning no less! AND back on the road in 2 hours!

We had dinner at Ponderosa, there are 2 in Taichung, with the Robarts then went back to their apartment for a short visit before driving home. It sure was nice to NOT have the extra servicing stops! This time the rest stop only had about 60 urinals..........

It was like driving to Regina and back for the day. WE'D NEVER DO THAT! Well ALMOST, never!! Dogs and Monday morning hair appointments pressed the return decision.

This afternoon I was out walking and noticed one clinic 'UROLOGY AND DERMATOLOGY' A curious combination in my limited experience! My mind wondered........I'll let you do yours and keep mine to myself, thank you very much.........

Well that's about it!
