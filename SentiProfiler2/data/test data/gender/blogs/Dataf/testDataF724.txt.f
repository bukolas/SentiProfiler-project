I wish I knew more about the situation. I wish the DR and Nurses were a little more concerned, but at the same time they are not and maybe that is a good sign that it really is not going to be that big of a deal, if it turns out to be anything at all. I wish Elko had more resources. I wish my mom was here with me. I wish I could research through the internet until I was satisfied.
