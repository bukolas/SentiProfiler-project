Wednesday night that Americans still, after all these months, do not know Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama.

Obama needs to explain his past, McCain told viewers.

McCain targeted Bill Ayers, who once served on a foundation board with Obama.  Ayers, a leader of the terrorist Weather Underground in the 1970s, has said that he took part in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, the Capitol building in 1971, and the Pentagon in 1972.

"I don't regret setting bombs," Ayers said in 2001. "I feel we didn't do enough."

Obama said he’d condemned Ayers’s violent past, had not involved him in his campaign, and wouldn’t have him as an advisor in the White House.

McCain also assailed the liberal group ACORN which has run a voter registration effort which is under investigation in Nevada and other states after some of its organizers turned in fraudulent registrations to election officials.

'One of the greatest frauds in voter history'
“We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN who is now on the verge of possibly perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history,” McCain said.
