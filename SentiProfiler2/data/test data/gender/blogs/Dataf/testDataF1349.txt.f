You're in Austin. You're about to see an ass load of indie bands perform out of every nook and cranny of this city. It's 95 degrees, then it suddenly hails, then it goes back to 95 degrees with a humidity index of 99%. You spot a boy who wears a smaller jean size than you and you are determined to make out with him by the end of the night. It's late, you're drunk off of Lone Stars because you only had seven breakfast tacos about twelve hours ago, and you have blisters lining the bottom of your feet. These are questions and scenarios that will arise this week during SXSW. Don't be unprepared! Follow my survival guide list below and you're sure to have a worth-while and healthy SXSW experience. 1.) The Fanny Pack - Fuck purses. Who said these ever went out of style? WHO? TELL ME! I recommend the American Apparel shiny denim fanny pack in royal blue because it's awe-inspiring. Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Pretty. 2 .) A Pair of Tom's Shoes - Never mind. These hipster staples are like having a thin layer of burlap separating you from the ground. I can't believe they're donated to a child every time a pair is sold. The next generation is going to grow up all jacked with arthritis. (-this statement is in jest...Tom's is a great company that does a lot of wonderful things) 3.) Cheap Brightly Colored Wayfarers - Because in a way we're all still stuck in 2004, aren't we? 4.) Cardigan - Texas weather is known to be a fickle one, so make sure to carry around a cardigan with you for night or when it spontaneously rains though the precipitation level is 0%. Also, throwing on a cardigan over any shitty ol' outfit, will suddenly make you look more intelligent than you actually are. 5.) Clean Underwear - 'Cause Lord only knows what you're going to do with your current pair of underwear. 6.) Scrunchies - Ladies, you make fun of them, but you know you secretly love them. Who is going to hold back your hair when you're puking up all that free Hornito's in the Beauty Bar toliet? Not that DJ with the florescent bike cap. He's been eyeing the girl with the non-prescription horn-rimmed glasses that are over-taking her face all night. You always have a friend in the scrunchie.&nbsp; 7.) Fake Mustache - Because you don't want to feel left out in this city. 8.) Business Cards - Business cards legitimize you. Even if you have nothing to sell.&nbsp; 9.) Granola Bars - The nice thing about Austin is that we're not a bunch of assholes that bump up the price of everything while you're visiting. However, your eating times might be off and in order to not get wasted by 4PM, it's worth carrying some snacks around with you (Dear Lord. I sound like my mother). 10.) Water- Blah blah blah boring 11.) $1's - For when you wander off alone to the strip club near the airport during a drunken blackout. Right, Marcos? 12.) Air Mattress - Often enough couches are better than air mattresses. Most of the time you wake on the hard wood floor, the mattress having deflated like that of your hard-on after popping way too many Adderall. However, the couch might already be taken by the time you get there, so make sure you come prepared.&nbsp; 13.) Chapstic k - Because by the end of the night, your mouth is going to look like that of a crusty crack addict. 14.) Condoms 15.) Diana Camera - To commemorate the night you get shit-faced with Bill Murray or corner David Byrne up against a wall and explain to him how you two were always meant to be together...in lo-fi. Not that long ago, I received an email from an Austin-based musician very eloquently sharing with me the day he realized he was a hipster. His words were poignant, describing his realization as though he was suddenly inflicted with an incurable disease- Hipstermystalacosis. I related to his story and I think you will too. When I was thirteen and running around in suspenders and non-prescription eyeglasses, I knew there was a name for me. For years I fought the label, but gave up my denial of being a hipster when I christened the name of my blog Hipstercrite. Now when someone calls me a hipster, I shake my head in agreement. I am a hipster and probably always will be. Hipsters, stand up tall! Unite! Dear Lauren, I've been an admirer of your page for a few months. I was linked through "TapeBombs," a music blog run by an acquaintance of mine. Like you, I am dangerously preoccupied with hipsterism and spend a good deal of my day confronting the issue. The reason I am mailing is because I think I represent an interesting case study: a person caught in the paralyzing fear of his latent hipsterism and shocked into his true identity by a harrowing event. Here is my account: I was riding my bike down Duval and the sun was out. At this point I believed firmly in my individuality. Of course, my handlebar wrap matched my brake housing, and the same with the metal cages that held my water bottles; all were red. I wore purple shoes and no helmet. The memory of a triumphant sexual encounter arose quickly, then left. I was pleased with my performance and didn't dwell on the details, didn't analyze a thing. I only recalled the sensations and sounds that make good sex memorable. The day was warm. Readjusting my fingers on bar, I found them to be quite cool; I hadn't begun to sweat. The best part of the ride. In the first few seconds of what would be the minute and a half that changed my life, I didn't recognize the origin of the rumble, growing closer, rapidly becoming a roar, like the slow onset of a far off thunderclap. The sound came from the twin tail pipes of a Chevy Diesel truck. Suddenly, they were upon me. As I turned down a steep hill near 51st and Lamar, I was forced against the curb. The huge wheels of the truck kicked up dust and rocks and I was struck by a few of them. A large white male leaned out of the passenger window, ejecting a thimble-full of spit across the front of my shirt. A beer bottle whizzed over my head. I felt like a frightened Russian Hussar riding against Napoleon, holding out my hand as if to protect myself from the zip of bullets and the whistle of passing artillery. At this point, about a foot separated my handle-bars and the side of the truck. After a few more terrifying seconds, the truck sped up quickly, finishing the descent and pulling into a parking lot at the bottom of the hill. I knew what they had in mind. But remember, I was not some pussy hipster. I was not androgynous. I was a man. That archaic sense of honor strengthened me. Four men stepped out (the type of men who buy their groceries at the county feed store). They came at me from thirty yards away, not running, but at a kind of a trot, like this was a leisure activity. I lept off of my bike and approached them in the middle of the lot. I put my dukes up, lithely shifting from side to side with the assured stance of an experienced boxer. I think they sensed my confidence, baseless as it was. They stopped about ten feet away. I held my ground. Each wore what looked to be an Ed Hardy tee. Only I didn't sense the danger then. I was like a cornered puma, fiercer because death clears away the vale of fear. Underneath the decorated tees, the four mens limbs were taut and ready. One word, one altered expression would have uncapped that explosive energy. But there was silence. The crack of bat, followed by childrens laughter, echoed from the top of the hill. We measured one another. It was the leader who broke the silence. His followers relaxed. The engagement was apparently broken off, or at least postponed for a moment. He said, " Fuck you, limp dicked hipster." His friends didn't laugh, but chimed in. "Pussy! Hipster! Faggot!" I didn't reply. I had relaxed my stance. The passenger side agitator spat at me again, but missed. Twenty seconds later the truck was gone and I was left alone in the bright sun. My world view was completely fucking shattered. What passed through my mind as I gingerly pedaled home was not so much the glorious afterglow of a manly confrontation, but the providential nature of my lot in life. I knew that, so far as the outside world was concerned, I was a hipster. Whatever innate qualities I possessed were in dichotomous opposition to a certain portion of society, whose hatred of my "type" acted as a form of self-actualization. This tension was absolutely necessary, and in a larger sense, determined my ultimate role in history. I still have not recovered, not fully. Now, when I listen to my own music, songs like "Don't Try and Take My Guns," "Burning Panties," and "You Should Start A Band," I do not hear the voice of myself, but someone who struggles to hide the mark of an old wound. And while I am ashamed and at times it all seems clownish and sad, I remember that this is what makes good art - that is, fear and its poignant beauty, like a shivering mouse you've caught in a beam of light. My story is that of the reluctant hipster. In your word, "pretending we're not hipsters is what we do best." In this way, I am surely the most resourceful of hipsters. But, unlike so many others, it has enriched my art and given me a new purpose; or more nearly, an enhanced clarity of vision. Sincerely, Marshall Galactic of The Frontier Brothers Marshall Galatic is from the Austin-based band The Frontier Brothers . You can catch them during SXSW at these shows: Mar 16 2010 8:00P Chupacabra Cantina - From the Mind of Adi Showcase w/Peter and the Wolf Mar 18 2010 1:00P 21st St Co-op Dayparty w/Motel Aviv, Black Taxi, and Federal!

Stopped at a traffic light last Friday afternoon, I glanced up at a familiar restaurant marquee that usually carried a quip relating to the latest music festival/bike rally/music rally/bike festival in Austin that week. However, this time the words bore a different sentiment: "Go Texas! Win it for Leslie !" The light turned green and I found myself driving south down Congress Avenue with tears pooling at the bottom of my eyelids. Every Austinite knows who Leslie is. He is the city mascot. The epitome of what makes Austin unique. For those who do not know him, Leslie Cochran is a homeless man who wears a leopard print thong. He has run for city mayor multiple times and has been reviewed 53 times on Yelp . He is an extremely articulate and sweet-natured man. No one has a bad thing to say about Leslie. Which is why it's so surprising that unnamed assailants beat Leslie to unconsciousness two weeks ago. Leslie was in bad shape and listed in critical condition. The townspeople formed a vigil and the local news gave daily updates on his health. It was looking like Leslie was not going to make it, but miraculously he pulled through and was released from the hospital last week. He has since thanked the locals for their support, stating that he would have not made it through otherwise. Though a percentage of his medical bills have been taken care of, there will be a fundraiser on November 1st to help pay the rest. By the time I read the sign last Friday, I knew that Leslie was alive and well. What made me tear up was the realization that I live in a town that cares immensely for an eccentric homeless man. It's also a city where that same homeless man can run for mayor multiple times and still get thousands of votes. Last month marked my one year anniversary of moving to Austin. I moved here with no road map and only what I could fit in my car. The plan was to stay a few months and then see where my ADD took me next. However, whatever energy that made me curious enough to move here has made me stay here. I could tell after my first night in Austin that I was someplace special and I haven't wanted to leave since. Each day this city inspires me more and more and at moments I can honestly say that I'm in love (that could also be because I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time). So in honor of this city that took me in with open arms after fleeing a tumultuous relationship with Los Angeles, I will begin using this blog for part-time Austin "goings-on", part-time hipstercrite musings. not sure who the owner of this picture is, but thanks Everyone ought to have a Lower East Side in their lif e- Irving Berlin The East Side has typically been synonymous with art, culture, history, and grit. When we venture through LES in NYC or Wicker Park in Chicago or Silver Lake in Los Angeles, we feel like we've stepped back into time, that we're not necessarily welcome, and that at any moment something wonderful or terrible might happen. This also goes for Austin's east side. A vibrant and fascinating part of the city, Eastside boasts eclectic eateries, trendy bars, and dozens of notable art galleries all maintaining the feel of a bygone era. Chances are you'll be spending some time over on the Eastside during SXSW and if so, you might want to know where to eat (if you aren't stuffed full of free breakfast tacos supplied at the parties). Here is a list of some of the best East Austin restaurants, cafes, and bars: Best Pizz a: East Side Pies 1401 Rosewood Ave. Many will say that Homeslice on SoCo is the best pizza in Austin, but they're embarrassingly wrong. East Side Pies is hands down the best and most imaginative pizza around. Try their Veggie Nacho pizza topped with spicy black bean sauce, onion, tomatoes, jalapenos, and avocados. Or their Blue Moon which is a tomato-less pizza topped with feta, mozzarella, ricotta, goat, romano , and blue cheeses. They also supply delicious salads, blondie brownies, and bottled sodas. The staff is awesomely sassy and the place is a little small and very busy, so make sure you don't dilly-dally. Price: Cheese slice $2.50/Meat or veggie slice $3.00 Best Vegan/Vegetarian: Mr. Natural 1901 E. Cesar Chavez One of two Mr. Natural locations in Austin, this restaurant is conveniently located in the heart of the east side. Both a restaurant and a health food store, Mr. Natural supplies an assortment of food options ranging from a vegan/vegetarian lunch and dinner bar that changes daily to delicious baked goods to cakes to homemade juices. Absolutely worth trying is the Soya Guisada on Fridays and the vegan mint chocolate cupcake. You will never think of veganism the same way again. Price: Lunch buffet $7.99, pastries range from .75-$3.50 Best Mexican : Juan in a Million 2300 E. Cesar Chavez This was a hard category to decide in. I like a lot of Mexican food on the Eastside : Aranda's simplicity, El Chile's creativity, and all the taco trailers in between. I chose Juan in a Million because it's the most famous Mexican food restaurant on the Eastside , having been featured on the Travel Channel's Man vs. Food and Countdown Chowdown . Juan in a Million is most famous for their "Don Juan", a potato, bacon, egg, and cheese scramble that, which I believe, has been cooked on the same griddle for over twenty years. It's also $3.60 and could last you two days! The atmosphere is quaint, but make sure to go at off times. Especially on the weekend, lines can form down the sidewalk! Price: The Don Juan $3.60 Best Sandwich: Bossa Nova 2121 E. 6 th St. Located across the street from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, this Brazilian eatery has some of the best food on the east side. Don't let the fact that it's Brazilian scare you away- their menu is plentiful and delicious while still being unique. My favorite sandwich (when I eat meat) is the Misto Tudo which has turkey, ham, sliced egg, green olives, palm, and mozzarella. Or the Salada de Maca with romaine, apples, cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, and balsamic dressing. Price: Lunch Special- any 1/2 sandwich or pizza slice with a side salad or soup $6.99 Best Coffee : Texas Coffee Trader s 1400 E. 4 th St. Texas Coffee Traders is quite possible my favorite place to visit on the Eastside . Often overlooked due to the fact that it's housed in a warehouse, this place is not to be missed. A Disneyland for the coffee connoisseur, Texas Coffee Trade
s has rows and rows of unique coffee to taste and buy. Typically a place to get your coffee in bulk, the friendly staff will fix you up a cup of cappuccino or tea while you wait. However, this year for SXSW, the store will be setting up a coffee stand on the corner of 4th and Navasota, so make sure to check them out! These guys will remind you of why you love Austin. Most Romantic: Justine's 4710 E. 5 th St. Justine's is relatively new to the Eastside , but a wonderful addition. Situated in an old house, the ambiance of Justine's is quaint and warm. One enters below a vintage neon sign onto a front yard draped with string lights and tables. Inside the dark wood and vaulted ceiling of the house make for a cozy atmosphere. Justine's is a great place to grab a drink or dine in. Inspired by French cuisine, my favorites include the Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade (endives, rouqefort , walnuts, and pear) and the Steak Tartare . Price: Endive Poire Rouqefort Salade $8.50, Steak Tartare $14 Most Metropolitan: East Side Show Room 1100 E. 6 th St. East Side Show Room is also a relatively new to the Eastside . Channeling a 1920's feel, the bar/restaurant showcases vintage furniture and fixtures, local art, and some of the best lighting in town. East Side Show Room is also one of the best places to see and be seen these days. The menu is a little steep, but definitely creative and delicious. Their curried grits and greens is a must, as is their Barbequed Quail and Oranges. Price: Curried Grits &amp; Greens $9, Barbequed Quail &amp; Oranges $18 Most Chill: Rio Rita 1308 E. 6 th St. Rio Rita has quickly become of of my favorite hangout spots on the Eastside . Cafe by day, lounge by night, this funky bar looks like an explosion went off in a vintage furniture store. Rio Rita serves a collection of local food, infused vodkas, and mystery beers. On Monday night you can listen to your own 45 for "Love and a 45" night or bring your crayons and glue for "Arts and Drafts" night on Thursdays. This is definitely a great place to kick back and mingle with the quirkiest of the bunch. Price: Ham &amp; Brie sandwich $6.50, Turkey &amp; Cranberry on a Croissant $6.50 Photo source: Yelp.com Do you have that one dress, one pair of hot pants, or that one hat that always compels people to stop you, grab you arm, and say in a low voice, "Where on Earth did you get that?" Well I just found me a pair of socks that garnered lots of comments at Whole Foods yesterday ('cause you have to look good when you go to Whole Foods). And an awkward run-in with a security guard at Wells Fargo. The security guard was sitting on a bench, and I think she quietly said, "I like your boots" (meaning she liked my awesome kick-ass lace-up slippers) as I walked by. I didn't quite hear what she said, so I turned and gave a slight smile. The sort of smile that says, "I have no idea if you were talking to me or not, but here, here is a half smile to sort of acknowledge what you said". I started obsessing over whether or not she was talking to me and I started to sweat. I wanted to walk up to her and say, "Thank you!", but the time for that had past and I started to rock back and forth in line. When I left the bank and nodded to her, she stared at me stone-faced and I was convinced that she now hated me for giving her a half-ass smile in return for her very sweet compliment. So you wanna know what socks will get you compliments at Whole Foods and awkward Larry David-like situations at banks? The Lacy Lace-up Slipper Socks by Sock Theory . The best part? They're $7. They also come in white. Make sure to check out Sock Theory' s broad collection of unique socks, leg warmers, arm warmers, knee-highs, and panty-hose. Definitely my new favorite online store. Here are few pics of me wearing my new lace-up's. I had to cut my head out because the sun was so bright yesterday, between my squinting and scrunched up mouth while squinting, I looked like what would happen if Renee Zellweger and Sloth procreated. Also, I don't shine my shoes. Obs. First post in my Austin, TX series for SXSW It's that time of year again. The time of year where you stock up on your Adderall or Xanax or Xantac or horse tranquilizers and set your Facebook tagged photos to private. South by Southwest Interactive and Film will be starting this Friday, with the music portion beginning next Wednesday. What does that mean for you? That means your chances of getting drunk with Bill Murrary or hooking up with a hipster from Brooklyn who is in a band with the words "bear", "deer", "neon", "gold", or "black" in it have just improved. If you're new to Austin, here is a list of traits that make our town so unique. Come and join the fun! 1.) The entire city collectively waits with bated breath for the Groupon of the day. 2.) At anytime in anyplace, your chances of hearing New Order playing on the sound system are 2 to 1. 3.) We treat music festivals like national holidays (and we really don't have a choice). 4.) Overhear conversations that start with, (person looking at their Iphone), "Oh, looks like Brooklyn Vegan is following me on Twitter. Cool." (overhear= I said it yesterday). 5.) Facebook comments like, "There is a little kids choir singing Flaming Lips and Wilco at my place of employment right now." 6.) Every single person has a mustache and we have competitions once a month to see who has the best. Photo by Alison Narro 7.) A 24 hour pecan vending machine in the middle of nowhere. 8.) We eat migas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and we can tell you exactly where in town the best migas are located. 9.) The rivers in Austin are made of beer and you can often find us knelt in the river bed, stuffing our goard like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka. 10.) We quietly judge each other on the make of our bicycles and nothing else. 11.) The older and more worn your clothing is, the more street cred you have. 12.) We do a lot of our business out of Airstream trailers. Mostly for aesthetic purposes. The South by Southwest Festival in Austin, TX will be starting this Friday. I plan on devoting most of the week to Austin and SXSW posts. However, I haven't written a single thing yet! In the meantime, please enjoy this gallery of Maurizio Cattelan's work. I learnt of Cattelan this weekend while in Houston. The Menil Collection is currently exhibiting some of his pieces. I'm still brewing what I think about him. What are your thoughts? You have nine followers, and one of them is your mother. You wonder why the hell you're even blogging. You speculate if anyone will ever read your words. You ponder if life is worth living. Well look no further! Listed below are twelve sure-fire ways to drive traffic to your blog and instantly boost your self-worth. 1.) Join Blogging Network Sites - The best blog networking website is Twenty-Something Bloggers. Hands down. Joining 20sb opened up a whole new world for me. Before then, I had no idea how to discover other blogs. 20sb is a supportive and strong community of like-minded bloggers. I can't recommend it enough. Other blogging networks include Blog Lovin ', Blog Her , BlogCatalog , and My Blog Log . 2.) Write Interesting Content - As much as want to go into great detail about your recent trip to the dentist or how you wrapped your Christmas gifts, refrain from it. Truthfully, nobody cares. Unless the dentist had a boner while performing your root canal or you lobbed off your finger while cutting wrapping paper for you gifts...then we might be interested. Humor is a guaranteed way to enter the hearts of millions. Take for example Hyperbole-and-a-Half . You could learn a lot from her. 3.) Write About A Trend Topic - I don't adhere to this rule at all, but it's definitely a way to create buzz on your blog. Commenting on the cultural importance of "Jersey Shore" or how Justin Bieber looks like he should be on the "L Word" is a good way to start a convo. 4.) Befriend Other Bloggers - The blogging community is a tight-knit one. I have met people that I'm convinced sat next to me at the Algonquin Roundtable in another life. These people have encouraged me to grow as a writer and have supported and advertised my work. I wouldn't be where I am today without them and I try to do the same for them. As The Beatles once said, "The love you take is equal to the love you make". 5.) Leave Comments - Bloggers love comments like Mickey Rourke loves ghastly printed button-ups. Our self-esteem begins to slowly hinge on how many comments are left on our blog a day. If you comment on our blog, we will love you forever and most likely return the favor. 6.) Brand Yourself- The general consensus on this seems to be "yucky", but I disagree. The more polished the blog is, the greater the chance a reader will take it more seriously, no? Having a "brand" shows the world that you are legit. Does it take away from the personal aspect of blogging? Sometimes. But this is where you have to get clever in how you brand yourself. Subliminal branding. 7.) Photos! - Photos are a win-win all 'round. Photos grab attention. Photos can often work in substitute of text (Tumblr?). Photos can inspire. I try to put a picture in every single one of my posts, even if it's not necessary. Like a picture of my ass. 8.) Lists - We seem to really like lists. They're easy to read and typically very visual. Remember, the average internet reader's attention span is like 45 seconds (I made that up). It's kind of true though. Think of some of your favorite posts on Buzzfeed or EW.com . Short and sweet lists. 9.) Connect With Your Audience- One of the most talked ideas running through the marketing world these days is Lady Gaga's rise to fame due in part to her fan interaction and loyalty. DoDo like GaGa. Also, the blogs that appear to have the most comments are blogs where the writer shares a part of him/herself with the readers in the post, then interacts with them via the comment box. Personal is good, but don't forget rule #2. 10.) Self Promote, But Only 20% Of The Time - Nobody likes a showoff. However, who is going to know about your blog if you don't say anything? I know some very humble bloggers who haven't even told anyone that they have a blog! You have to walk a fine line here. Tweet or FB that you have a new post up, but don't send personal messages to strangers telling them to check out your blog. Nobody likes that. In fact, we'll purposely not go check out your blog. 11.) Believe That Your Traffic Will Go Up- I know it can get discouraging at times, but don't give up. People want to hear what you have to say. If you believe that your blog will be successful, it most likely will. Power of suggestion. 12.) Post a Picture of Your Ass Keep me posted on your progress! I'm curious to hear.
