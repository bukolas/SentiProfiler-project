In case you haven't been following me on Twitter or Facebook the past few days...Tricia was admitted into the hospital on Tuesday evening. An x-ray during her oncology appointment on Tuesday showed something in her lungs...fortunately, he doesn't believe it is lymphoma...it may be a fungal lung infection. Tricia has been coughing for a few weeks, so we figured something was going on. She hasn't been feeling bad, just a little more tired than usual, and a visit last week to the local ER didn't show anything. But, last night, after 24 hours in the hospital and a bronchoscopy that morning, she had a fever of 103. She is feeling better this morning. We are waiting for results from blood work and biopsies to determine what the problem is. They have started her on IV antibiotics. Because she will probably be at Duke through the weekend, Gwyneth and I returned home ysterday afternoon. We'll wait for the call to go back and bring Tricia home. Thanks for your prayers for Tricia this week. I'll update more when I can, and give you an update on Gwyneth's appointments later.
