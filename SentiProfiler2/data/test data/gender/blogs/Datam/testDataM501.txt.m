I know this will be hard to believe, but an overwhelming majority of the divorced parents I've worked with truly want what's best for the kids. Unfortunately, a lot of behavior suggests otherwise. But, let me remind you that divorce is packed with overwhelming emotion, high stress, and periods of utter chaos. And keep in mind that some people just do not get it when it comes to healthy interaction. Not only that, some people simply cannot control their anger. Combine that with little skill in the communication department and you have a good chance for conflict.
