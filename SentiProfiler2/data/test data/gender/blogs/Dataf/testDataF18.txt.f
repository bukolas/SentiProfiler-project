Calling all Moms
I know it's been awhile since I've blogged. Things have been a little crazy lately. More on that later.

Now, I have two questions for all you moms out there. Eli is turning 1 next month (how did that happen?!?) and so I need to start looking for a new car seat for him. I don't know much about the next size. I've heard things about 3-in-1 and booster-convertible or whatever, but I really know nothing. So, rather than researching like I should, I thought I would just ask:

1) What kind of a carseat do you recommend for a 1+ year-old?

I don't really want to spend a fortune, but at the same time, I know it will get used through the years, so I don't mind investing in something that will last.

Next, I need ideas on food. I seem to be a little stumped on what to feed Eli lately. I know there are probably lots of things I'm not thinking of. He LOVES to feed himself and is not so keen on the purees anymore (mostly because I have to feed him), but he only has 4 teeth, and he's not a year old yet, so there are things he can't eat yet, so I need ideas. His favorite things lately (finger foods) are avocados, bananas, crackers, cheerios, and peas. I'm still breastfeeding, so he gets a lot of his nutrition from me, but we are nearing the weaning phase, so I need to find more balanced things to give him. So, the next question:

2) What foods (finger foods mostly) do you recommend for a 10+ month-old?

Okay, I'm ready for the suggestions now. :) I've seen other people do things like this on their blog, and I'm always amazed at the awesome responses, so I'm counting on you! Any and all comments are welcome (even if you don't have children). Thank you! :)
