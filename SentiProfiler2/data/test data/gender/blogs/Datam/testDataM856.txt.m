I love this show sooo much. its very interesting and the charecters are real and great.  it was nice seeing richard dean anderson again.  he is hilarious in this series.  I like michael shanks, he is good looking and his charecter is a total stud.  Amanda Tapping and Christopher (teal'c) are also great actors and they all get along great on the show.  i just love the concept of the stargate show, love it love it love it.  recomend it!
