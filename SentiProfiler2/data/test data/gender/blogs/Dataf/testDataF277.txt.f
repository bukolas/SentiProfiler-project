You got to watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIwrV5e6fMY (It's 20 minutes long so get comfortable) And the accompanying article for more information about the award: http://www.tedprize.org/jamie-oliver/ Jamie Oliver is working to change children's lives by tackling school lunch. When he accepts the award he does a dramatic display with sugar. That's all I'm going to say about that. And then the clips of the families he is working with...wow. My favorite part is when he takes a bunch of different vegetables into the classroom and shows them to the students. He asks them to name each of them. A kid calls an eggplant "a pear." I'm going to try the that with my students sometime soon (this week if I find time to get to a grocery store). It's the Jamie Oliver Vegetable Experiment!
