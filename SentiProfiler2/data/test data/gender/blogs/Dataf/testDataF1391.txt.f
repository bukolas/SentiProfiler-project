God spoke to my heart today. I have been in a season of change. It is much needed changed but it wasn't change I had control over which made me uncomfortable. So for the last 47 days of my life I have been seeking clarity and direction in my life. I have gone through so many different emotions and have questioned God over and over again. I prayed and prayed but weeks have gone by and nothing. Nothing has changed in my situation. My days are long and unproductive. I have been completely unmotivated to do anything but the absolutely necessary.
