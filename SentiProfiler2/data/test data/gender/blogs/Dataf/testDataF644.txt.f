I loved Juno. It left me feeling really happy, and that's all you can really ask from a movie, right? I thought it was loads better than Little Miss Sunshine, which it has oft-been compared to, and I actually thought, as unplanned pregnancy movies go, it was much better than Knocked Up (which I enjoyed). I don't want to say too much since this is still in limited release and a lot of people probably haven't seen it yet, but some stuff I really liked:-the music, I thought it was perfect. I rarely ever buy movie soundtracks and I want to get the soundtrack.-it was structured around a school year and there were little subtitles for spring, summer, fall, and winter. This worked really well in my opinion--when you're in high school, so much hinges around the changing of the seasons. -Michael Cera's character didn't have much to do, and his head-in-the-sand behavior regarding the pregnancy bugged me.-there was one scene, that I don't want to describe because it was a pivotal plot point (and one I didn't see coming), that was so emotionally awkward and visceral that it made me uncomfortable. In a good way.-I liked Ellen Page in Hard Candy and I like her even more now.-Yes, some of the slang was awkward and felt forced--particularly one line "honest to blog?" that made me cringe--but I think that died down as the movie went on.-Loved Alison Janney as the stepmom. Loved when the dad said "I'm gonna hit that Paulie Bleecker kid in the wiener"-There was a slag against ultrasound techs! My fiance, currently in school for medical imaging, was very defensive. Hah.-Jennifer Garner always seemed kinda blah to me in a Sandra Bullock way, but she was very good here.-Funny that Juno learned that babies have fingernails when they are born, cause I just learned that
