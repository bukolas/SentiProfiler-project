Today's menu: rib-b-que ("all beef patty" with bbq sauce), whole wheat bun, peach fruit cup, beans, milk I have eaten more beef over the past two months than I ate the whole year of 2009. In fact, I never purchase beef at the grocery store. It does not appeal to me. The only times I eat beef are when I order it when we're at a restaurant (very rarely -- maybe in a Chinese stir fry dish) or if it is served at a friend's house. My husband basically refuses to eat beef. We eat a lot of chicken, turkey, and fish that I prepare at home. I wasn't raised eating a lot of red meat. I have enjoyed a bison burger occasionally over the past couple years. Bison burgers are similar to beef in taste, but are far more lean (in both fat and calories -- I looked it up). Actually, I believe bison is better tasting. The best thing about consuming bison is that you are helping support the prosperity of buffalo as a native animal here in the US. Is a pipe dream to think that bison meat could be served at schools? (vegetarian and vegan readers - sorry!) I think somebody is trying to be creative with the "rib-b-que" meat (the illusion of variety), but the kids aren't fooled. I asked one of my students "What did you have for lunch today?" and he replied, "A hamburger."
