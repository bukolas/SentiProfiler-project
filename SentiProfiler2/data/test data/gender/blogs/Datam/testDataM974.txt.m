You never know the person that you see on the street.
You never know the person that is behind or before you in the line at the grocery store.
You never know what the person has gone through, or what they're going through right now.

Sometimes You never even know what's going on in your life.

I'm taking steps.  The steps maybe small, but eventually they will get me a heckuva lot further then I am now.  
I'm taking steps.  I never want to feel "comfortable" where I am, for if I were that way, I would not be in the Geographical State that I'm in.
I'm taking steps.  To reach out and meet new people.

Sometimes You never even know where your life would be if you didn't take that extra step.

So take a step, and see what happens!  (I dare ya!)
