It's funny, but I barely remember the first time I visited New York. I was nine years old, and went with my Dad and brother to see the World's Fair in Queens. I remember the It's a Small World Exhibit, but mostly I remember the car ride home on the Jersey Turnpike, gazing out at the brightly lit New York skyline and realizing for the first time that if it's dark outside, you can actually look sideways out the window and not get car sick.  

The next time I visited New York, I was on an eight grade class trip. I think we went to the United Nations, but I don't recall that. Here are the two things I do remember - (1) singing "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"while stuck in traffic coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel onto 42nd Street, which in those days was lined with Peep Shows and Porn Shops and (2) being a smart-ass with my friends and leaving a one-cent tip at the restaurant in Tudor City where we were packed in and served overcooked Salisbury Steak, which was basically inedible. (Even then, I was a food critic..)

The third time I visited New York, I fell in love. It was a day trip I took during college with my best friends. I think we must have seen a play, but for the life of me, I don't remember what it was. This time it was lunch at Mama Leone's, which even I, the rube from Philly, recognized as cattle call for tourists - the place was loud and packed and I felt like a number.  And the portions?  HUGE. Like "I think I'm gonna' be sick", huge.  So we decided to walk it off with a stroll in Central Park. And it was there, sitting under the Wisteria Arbor on the West Drive, that I fell. Hard. 

Maybe it was  the intoxicating floral perfume. Combined with post-prandial carbohydrate overload and a bit of a buzz from the wine we had with lunch. And a warm spring day and best friends. And that skyline. (Clearly, it was not the food...) All I knew was - I was in love. With a city. And I knew - I had to move here.
