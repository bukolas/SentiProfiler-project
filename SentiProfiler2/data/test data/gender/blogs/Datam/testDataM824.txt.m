the city i live in is bisected by a beautiful river. i cross it two times every day. the otonabee was once a wild river that the first nations used to travel through this region. later, it drew the early settlers to its side because it provided not only the necessary liquids around which all life inevitably gathers, but also because it provided a source of energy. energy to drive grainmills and woodmills. many cities began their lives this way.
