The new addiction was... 1&nbsp;peeled grapefruit 1&nbsp;cucumber 2 apples 2 carrots 2 bunches parsley Juiced But now that I see this photo, the new addiction is officially... Learning&nbsp;how&nbsp;to focus this (old, but still new and unused)&nbsp;lens I never bothered (to learn how) to use.&nbsp; Why, oh why?&nbsp; Because I'm so&nbsp;afraid of such technology...until my default&nbsp;technology dies on me I see the colors. Oh my.&nbsp; The colors. Lovely Donkey reminds me to tell you (while he spies,&nbsp;so far away,&nbsp;from his field) that on Tuesday, I saw a special someone, who smiles as wide as I do. :o) This is the church... where masked bandits go. {To steal more food.} I'd like to introduce you to my masked bandits.&nbsp; They're siblings.&nbsp; In action. Moments before, they were standing&nbsp;very tall on tippy toe hind feet, poking their heads in my window and demanding food.&nbsp; I screamed. Then I told them to warn me next time, so I can&nbsp;make sure the correct lens is&nbsp;in the camera.&nbsp; {I like to document said thievery.} They said, "Hey, we're just sniffing out those amazing raw sunflower seed burgers you're fixin' up.&nbsp; Hand&nbsp;'em over, please.&nbsp; Now."&nbsp; {Those vegan burgers do&nbsp;rock.} Then I pulled out the camera. That's when they said, "Hey, that's not fair...some of you people shoot us with things like that."&nbsp; Which is true, and why you see them&nbsp;scurrying&nbsp;down&nbsp;to make some ruckus under the safety of the cabin. This is what happens when you don't have pets.&nbsp; Because when you have pets, the sweet baby raccoons don't give a hoot about the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;They just want to wrangle with the pets.&nbsp;&nbsp;And climb the house. But I live in a cabin.&nbsp; Without pets.&nbsp; So they try to wrangle with me, instead.&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp;they don't get fed. And I like it. {Let's just hope they keep coming back for more.} My brand new medical doctor is the best medical doctor in the whole entire world. And I don't say this lightly. Especially since I&nbsp;usually prefer a ND ( Naturopathic Physician ) as my primary care (insurance covered) physician. But due to circumstance, this is not an easy (insurance covered) option, on the island.&nbsp;Yet I'm a very, very, very&nbsp;lucky girl, anyway.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;(since I last saw my pediatrician, back in the seventies...or was that the eighties?),&nbsp;I've finally found my&nbsp; forever doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a long wait,&nbsp;sometimes, for a really good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;still&nbsp;wait patiently for&nbsp;local (insurance covered) ND care.&nbsp; After all, I need them both.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mom and a Dad. This is&nbsp;why I think&nbsp;my brand new medical doctor is the best medical doctor in the whole entire world (and of course, I know there are more of them out there!)... -He is&nbsp;genuinely kind. -He is genuinely welcoming. -He let's me know that&nbsp;he appreciates that I'm there. -He believes me. -He spends an hour with me. -He listens patiently, when I remember what I forgot to share. -He is&nbsp;kind in a way that tells me I needn't worry about how I talk (so much, but I still panic and try to fix this). -He is extra thankful for the really old (expensive) hospital test results I&nbsp;found...'cause they really help. -He draws diagrams to help me understand what he suspects might be going wrong now. -He wants to find out for sure...what's behind this. -He orders more blood testing, without hesitation, to&nbsp;check and see where we're at. -He orders more hospital testing, without hesitation, to check and see how things are functioning. -He asks me&nbsp;how I'd next like to proceed. -He is totally okay with the fact that I have no idea how I'd next like to proceed. -He lets me know that he'll handle things and get back to me, soon. -He tries not to notice the entire office saying what a kind, thoughtful and thorough doctor he is. -He works really, really, really&nbsp;hard and to make personal family time for his sweet loved ones, too. May all humans be blessed with such goodness. Forever and ever , Amen. It's Sunday.&nbsp; So I'm confessing. I'd like to think I'm doing this on my own accord, but a Blackhawk&nbsp;has been&nbsp;circling&nbsp;the cabin for hours now, so here we are.&nbsp; I'm giving up. February was not my month.&nbsp; I didn't realize it until yesterday.&nbsp; It didn't sink in until today. And boy, howdy, it's time for me to&nbsp;make some changes. First,&nbsp;I didn't see the need to worry about&nbsp;Valentine's Day this year.&nbsp; Because as much as I love learning about love, I&nbsp;never really worry about&nbsp;Valentine's Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think everyday is Valentine's Day. While recently&nbsp;discussing this&nbsp;thing called February and&nbsp;love,&nbsp;I had no idea I'd&nbsp;discover a month filled with my very own emotional triggers.&nbsp; Where should I begin?&nbsp; Oh, I know... Once upon a time,&nbsp;I was engaged.&nbsp; On Valentine's Day.&nbsp; (Sort of.) It wasn't really a surprise engagement and it wasn't really emotionally connective.&nbsp; Meaning...maybe you could say...it wasn't romantic.&nbsp; But slightly uncomfortable and embarrassing.&nbsp; Dutiful.&nbsp; Obligatory.&nbsp; The next expected step in that thing called relationship.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a&nbsp;decision that was jointly made, two weeks prior, while rings were browsed. And then I was married. But&nbsp;I didn't want to walk down that aisle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't want to be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't want to spend all that money or invite lots of people.&nbsp; I didn't want to be stared at.&nbsp; I really didn't want to do all those obligatory wedding things.&nbsp; At all. For a girly girl who's extra mushy about&nbsp;intimate connection&nbsp;and who loves to learn about love, this wedding experience baffled me. I didn't have the words to figure this situation out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided&nbsp;I must be experiencing&nbsp;what it feels like&nbsp;when you don't want&nbsp;the big wedding.&nbsp; When you're&nbsp;practical.&nbsp; When&nbsp;you don't want to&nbsp;be the center of the event.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I plugged along.&nbsp; I didn't really&nbsp;think I had a choice.&nbsp; (I thought I was a victim of circumstance...that it was my duty to&nbsp;be good and behave...and to entertain.) Then&nbsp;a&nbsp;confusing&nbsp;thought&nbsp;began to creep up inside of me.&nbsp; The thought...that I did not know...what I did not know. Profound.&nbsp; I did not know what I did not know. I was immediately lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was this stuff, anyway?&nbsp; That I supposedly did not know?&nbsp; How could I not know it?&nbsp; How could I find out what it was, if I didn't even know what it was?&nbsp; Why was&nbsp;such a&nbsp;revelation just then camping out&nbsp;on the tip of my tongue?&nbsp; At that pivotal &nbsp;time?&nbsp; Yet I&nbsp;couldn't even find it...to learn it...to know&nbsp;it...and ASAP!&nbsp; How did that happen?&nbsp; To me?!&nbsp; What should one do? How could I possibly hurry and figure&nbsp;it all&nbsp;out, before walking down the isle? Or is that what marriage&nbsp;is for?&nbsp; Figuring such stuff out?&nbsp; Together? A good therapist&nbsp;would have been a proper solution.&nbsp; Religious clergy would have helped, pronto, too. &nbsp;But I didn't know about the importance of&nbsp;such things back then.&nbsp; So I decided it must be anxiety.&nbsp; And that marrige was for figuring&nbsp;such&nbsp;stuff out,&nbsp;together...after the wedding. I was going with that theory, anyway.&nbsp; I really should have asked more questions. Wait.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; I just didn't&nbsp;hear the answers that were right for me. (My fault.&nbsp; I thought I was supposed to support,&nbsp;believe and believe&nbsp;in another, no matter what.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;what worked for them was not right for me.) I thankfully mustered up the courage to leave.&nbsp; Years later.&nbsp; In February.&nbsp; Soon after Valentine's Day. Years after that, I still felt like&nbsp;a monkey was clinging to my back and I couldn't shake&nbsp;him off.&nbsp; As if I were still trapped. (And that was after lots of talking.&nbsp; About him.&nbsp; Had I&nbsp;gone straight to talking about me and my issues, things might have progressed more swifty.) There was another long-term&nbsp;relationship,&nbsp;where things appeared&nbsp;and felt very different, but where things&nbsp;turned&nbsp;out to be&nbsp;very much the same. &nbsp;(Don't worry, a good therapist can explain how this happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so tricky, let me tell you.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The month of February, a few years ago, was the last contact. Long(er) story short(er), February is a month&nbsp;that&nbsp;marks my&nbsp;freedom from&nbsp;things not good for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn't realize it until now.&nbsp; February is also a month which is supposed to be a symbol of&nbsp;love.&nbsp; Place these two&nbsp;together and one can feel confused.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;right on. The big little&nbsp;miracle:&nbsp; This February,&nbsp;I realize, is the very first February I don't&nbsp;feel&nbsp;trapped.&nbsp; Not by&nbsp;memories,&nbsp;feelings or&nbsp;experiences.&nbsp; I'm free.&nbsp; Those monkey's are off my back.&nbsp; Finally. And those changes I need to make?&nbsp; Starting tomorrow, March 1st,&nbsp;I'm solidly committing to these... 1)&nbsp; No more expectations.&nbsp; About anyone or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprises are much more fun. 2)&nbsp; No more waiting.&nbsp; For others to join in, to&nbsp;proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Independent progress is good for me. 3)&nbsp; No discussing others (keep it on&nbsp;the issues, not the people).&nbsp; If&nbsp;I feel pulled in,&nbsp;left or lost, it's time&nbsp;to let others&nbsp;be.&nbsp; No more victim in me. ( #3 is a bit military for me, as I've previously embraced the idea that we should&nbsp;have&nbsp;one private person&nbsp;in our life, with whom we can confidentially and safely&nbsp;discuss anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I've since learned that if that private&nbsp;confidant isn't a therapist or if they don't embrace "I" statements, confusion can occur.&nbsp; So I'm streamlining&nbsp;my focus.&nbsp; No discussing others.&nbsp;It'll be issues , instead.) This, for me,&nbsp;is about leaving February's foibles behind. This is about (re)dedicating myself to searching out&nbsp;those who share&nbsp;similar struggles and a similar will to learn, grow and evolve.&nbsp; Healthfully. This is about searching out those who look at you and feel good and strong about themselves, not uncomfortable. Not that any of us are perfect.&nbsp; People fail daily.&nbsp; Especially me. But if the mutual goal is to&nbsp;continually improve...that is where I'll now dutifully be. I'm march ing on.&nbsp; And you are always invited to join me. (Especially since I'll need all the&nbsp;help I can get.&nbsp; :o) We can taste. We can see. We can spend all day turning down an eternity with those we know are not meant to be. Ours. Privately. And then we somehow quickly forget. All of them. We&nbsp;instead fret. About that one special someone. Here or not yet here. Ready or not. And we blindly go forth. Lovingly. -ID ___________________________ Crazy Little Thing Called Love&nbsp; by Queen This thing called love.&nbsp; I just can't handle it.&nbsp; This thing called love.&nbsp; I must get round to it.&nbsp; I ain't ready.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; This (this thing).&nbsp; Called love (called love).&nbsp; It cries (like a baby).&nbsp; In a cradle all night.&nbsp; It swings (ooh ooh).&nbsp; It jives (ooh ooh).&nbsp; It shakes all over like a jelly fish.&nbsp; I kinda like it.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; There goes my baby.&nbsp; She knows how to rock n roll.&nbsp; She drives me crazy.&nbsp; She gives me hot and cold fever.&nbsp; Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat.&nbsp; I gotta be cool.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Get hip.&nbsp; Get on my tracks.&nbsp; Take a back seat.&nbsp; Hitch-hike.&nbsp; And take a long ride on my motor bike.&nbsp; Until I'm ready.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I gotta be cool.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Get hip.&nbsp; Get on my tracks.&nbsp; Take a back seat (ah hum).&nbsp; Hitch-hike (ah hum).&nbsp; And take a long ride on my motor bike.&nbsp; Until I'm ready (ready Freddie).&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; This thing called love.&nbsp; I just can't handle it.&nbsp; This thing called love.&nbsp; I must get round to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain't ready (ooh) ooh ooh.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love, yeah yeah.
