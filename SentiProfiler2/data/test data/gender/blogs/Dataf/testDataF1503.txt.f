It started raining Friday morning. And it rained. And then it rained. And then it really rained.

In the wee early hours of Saturday morning the wind became frenzied. An endless whistle punctuated by roaring gusts. The kind of wind that either mutes all other sounds or distorts them into something ominous.

Is that the trees moving? Or is there an army of ninjas crawling on the roof? 

Our backyard and the suburban crap sprawl beyond it inclines toward the house. Not the smartest groundbreaking move but itâ€™s really fine as long as you have a French drain around the foundation.

We do not have a French drain.

We do however have a lovely lakeside view.
