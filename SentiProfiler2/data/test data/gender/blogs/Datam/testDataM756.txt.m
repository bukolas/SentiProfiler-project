Bobby of the excellent Kitsune Noir asked me to do a bicycle-themed illustration for his Desktop Wallpaper Project . You can download the size of your choice here: The Desktop Wallpaper Project Featuring Ward Jenkins One thing I like about wallpapers is using the design as a way to organize your folders. Even though the arrows here are part of the composition behind the girl riding her bike, they also offer the user a chance to group certain folders together, for fun or whatever. For instance, all your folders that feature current projects can go on the bright green arrow, the ones that need immediate attention go on the red arrow, etc. Enjoy! Thought I'd share with you some of my favorite quotes that speak to me on so many levels. I notice a theme here. See if you can pick up on it: "I have forced myself to contradict myself in order to avoid conforming to my own taste." - Marcel Duchamp "Rules are what the artist breaks; the memorable never emerged from a formula." - William Bernbach , co-founder of legendary DDB ad agency. "I never had to compromise myself. It was always me, doing what was comfortable, and relaying the message that I didn't have to be taught to be creative and do good things. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm here and I want to be heard. I come from the streets, I painted on subways, and I feel my work is important. I want people to see it —I want to influence others." - Dondi White (aka DONDI - RIP) Hi guys, sorry for the inactivity lately. Still working on the book, among other things. Trying to manage my time wisely and well, that's a pretty hard task for me apparently. But I'm almost done, and soon I'll have some stuff to share here. I promise. Thanks for hanging on. I promise the wait will be worth your while! I think 2010 is going to be a great year for me. Heck, 2009 wasn't anything to sneeze at, I have to admit. It was pretty much a great year, if you ask me. 2010, now, I think will be another winner. It's certainly starting off well: I'm currently working on my second children's book. To be published by Simon & Schuster in the Spring of 2011. I know, a whole year off, but I'm sure you can manage. Deadline is looming, so I best be on my way. Merry Christmas, everyone. With love, The Ward-O-Matic The Christmas Angel Book by William Dugan. ©1965 Golden Press, Western Publishing Company, Inc. William (or Bill) Dugan is one of my favorite illustrators, creating some of the more interesting and colorful books for children during the midcentury era. There were certain details that Bill focused on for some of his pieces, like the hair and fabic, that stood out from the usual stuff. We read this each year for Christmas. If you never saw a white Christmas back in the day, you didn't have to fret. The stores always carried some instant snow for you to spray on your windows, right? To make it even more festive, you could also grab some stencils and make some pretty nifty snow decorations up on the windows themselves. Nice. Here's a couple of packs of Christmas stencils from the 50's for you to check out: All the stencils in this Paas Christmas Stencil Kit are intact and have never been punched out. I think this is the time when you say &quot;How jolly!&quot; Because that's what we say when we see a Santa Claus face. He's a jolly fellow. All the stencils are still in this one, too, but have been punched out—two with some paint residue. Guess they didn't want to use the fake snow. Love the cool illustration on the cover of this kit. Dig the kids. The ones that have paint on them are the &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; one (they used red AND white) and the angel praying. And here, you've got a can of Instant Snow: I took this photo last year, during the freak massive snow storm that hit Portland around Christmas time. There's a winter wonderland right behind me when I took this shot. On the back there's a warning: CAUTION Contents under pressure. Do not puncture. Do not throw into fire or incinerator. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not allow children or pets to eat snow. Gotta remember that last one. Howdy, kids. Hope you're getting into the Christmas-y mood. I know that there's snow on the ground over half of the country right now (well, I'm pretty sure it is, I think), so that's a good thing, right? Unless you're having to go out in said weather and get stuck in parking lots and long lines at the Post Office. In that case, sorry. Well, to help you get in the mood, I've been saving these things for you. A couple of booklets, one from 1958, the other from 1954: KVP Season's Greetings: Christmas 1958 : a booklet of carols for Christmastime. Illustrator: Hank Kolodziej. In case you want to know, KVP stands for Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment Company . You're welcome. By the way, I did a little research on Hank Kolodziej, and all I could find was this item on Ebay and a mention in this exhibit on automobile ads during the 60's and 70's, called Drawing Power: Motor City Ad Art in the Age of Muscle and Chrome . Awesome. Sounds like my kinda guy. Here's some of the other spreads in this booklet (there's more in my Flickr ): The image above is the inside cover, front (on left) and back (on right). The following is a little book on Christmas Trees, barely 12 pages long. Something I found in a bundle of various ephemeral items at some antique shop. Didn't really know what it was, but once I opened it up and saw all the wonderful drawings, I had to get it. Plus, the text is by T. S. Eliot. I mean, c'mon! Great stuff. The Cultivation of Christmas Trees , by T. S. Eliot. Typography, binding and decorations by Enrico Arno. ©1954, 1956. Enrico Arno has a great style here. This book looks pretty interesting. I might have to buy it. The note in the corner says: "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year - Ward Taylor 1956." Now, what are the odds that a guy named "Ward" actually gave this as a gift over 50 years ago? And that another Ward found it? Boggles the mind. Oh, and one more thing. Thought I'd get into the spirit of things by creating a new icon for Flickr & Twitter. 'Tis the Season! Here's to a great and wonderful Christmas Season, guys. A gentle reminder that the Early Bird Special: FREE SHIPPING over at The Ward-O-Matic Shop ends at the end of the day TOMORROW! That's Sunday, December 6th. If this'll make it easier for you to decide on whether or not you'd like to order a print, I doodle something different on each and every shipping invoice that's included with the shipment. Here's one example (actual doodle on an actual invoice, scanned for your pleasure): The character varies, but always done with a smile. It gets better, too. I also draw something special on the front (and back!) of each envelope I mail out. Done with marker on study cardboard mailer, I never sketch anything out first, just start drawin'! The character on the front is almost the same, called "The Dreamer", he (or she) conjures up the addressee's name and address for each envelope. (Sorry, didn't get a scan or photo for this post. Maybe next time.) On the back, something unique to every single buyer. Here are two examples: I've had people tell me that they save the envelopes, which totally makes me happy. Now, don't you want to buy a print today? Of course you do. Merry Christmas!
