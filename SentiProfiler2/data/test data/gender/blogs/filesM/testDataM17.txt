I was watching a show on Plane Crashes. They were saying it's not one event that causes a crash but a series of events that leads to the crater. Damn that sounds like my life! Yah there's a lot of things we can do to hedge our peace of mind but what's the bottom line? our happiness or peace of mind because they're not the same.
Yah I could have got an MBA bought a tire store in some corner of the world and lived out my life golfing raising five kids with the wife and making a difference in Kawanis. If this is you God bless you. I've lived my life listening to that subtle whisper in me "keep asking more of yourself keep growing!" My art is  humor my canvas my life. There isn't a single time I haven't been on stage that I haven't learnt something. I have chosen a life of pressure: corporate comic, comedy clubs, teacher, Key note speaker but there are things I can do to guarantee results: Keep finding ways to reinvent myself, keep looking at my goals and make sure my habits grow with them, keep re discovering ways to grow in my industry.
I thought about the events that lead to a wreck. I can use this same criteria to examine my personal  program. When I first began stand up my inner thought was panic. All my results came from that. Panic was what I sent out and what I got back. My thought now is " let's explore follow me."
My results are discovery and growth. If single events lead to result make sure your core thought is attracting the results you want. Our core thought determine whether we fly or crash achieve our destination or stay stuck.
Politics on Tuesday? Easy: Repubs Are the Danger
 At this point, who on the right is still kidding themselves: Republicans are not for actual medical reformation. They never have been. They want to keep their corporate medical sponsors (granted, it's been hard for the Dems with their corp med sponsors too). But the 'Pubs haven't put effort into anything except NOT putting effort into the reform Americans are desperately in need of.

Wait, that's not true. Repubs are putting a great deal of effort into scaring the hell out of the ignorant American populace that the (Obama v. 2.1) USA is going to take over their health care. And KILL US ALL! It's true. Ask Beck or Limbaugh or any of those other conservative ass-clowns who claim an allegiance to a more pure form of American government than the Republicans. And everything Obama does is bad and wrong and is deliberately so. Obama hates America!

So the Democrats have to go and the Republicans who don't get the AM Radio Stamp of WhateverTheFuck (most of them) ALL NEED TO GO. And by fostering that level of ignorant voting rampage, and ignorant Tea Party education, you foster a frenzy-dom of stupidity, a madness of idiocy, all of them suckling on the teat of talk radio like a crack baby on its amphetamine-laced lactation. 

Right wing radio: you're right. America is in danger. America is in danger from you. YOU are fostering not an educated populace, but an ignorant one. You are fostering your dream of an oligarchy ruled by madness that fits your version of reality.

You are the danger.

And as disconcerting as it is, I say: Bring it on. Usher Palin into 2012. Kill reform without solutions. We'll be waiting. With facts. And you will lose.
Windy here this afternoon; gusts up around thirty-five MPH. Sitting here a bit back staring out my window, sipping a taste of Wild Turkey when I saw a cloud of newspapers sailing by. I ain't talking here about a few, but a goddam blizzard of them.

    I had a flashback to a year or so ago when I looked out there and saw a few thousand plastic grocery store bags flying around, most of which got hung up in my pine trees. Remnants of some of them bags are still hanging around.

    Carrying my glass of Wild Turkey, I strolled down to the road to see what I could see. What I saw was a vortex of newspaper raising from Ms. Graham's backyard and heading my way. I also saw Ms. Graham running around in the road trying to snatch her runaway newspapers out of the air. She wasn't having much luck.

    I like Ms. Graham, seventy-two year old retired school teacher, and subscriber to about nine newspapers, which, after reading, she piles in a stack on her back patio for a year or two.

    I walked on down to her. She was sort of shook up that her stash of  newsprint was blowing off in a N/E direction and getting hung up on mailboxes, power lines, trees and such.

    I suggested to her it was not that big a deal; that newspaper would rot right into the ground pretty soon.

     "Besides," I told her, "if I run out of toilet paper any time soon, I'll just go out and pluck some off my trees."

     You might think a seventy-two year retired school teacher wouldn't find that funny.

     You'd be wrong.
You hear many vhristians claiming that their god is the absence of evil.  They usually start their conversation with things like "dark is the absence of light" and "heat is the absence of cold".  There is even the hoax letter that has been going around for years now about the student who supposedly one up's his mean evil atheist professor, using the very things said above.  In some versions it is said that Einstein did it, either way not only is it a fake and one of the worst christian arguments, it also provides one of the best counter arguments against such a god. 

     I go over this in the form of a reductio ad absurdum in a previous blog, "A Different Look at the Problem of Evil", but lets form it into a direct argument against the god presented above.
1) God is pure good, the absence of evil. (Matthew 19:17).
2) If god is the absence of evil, then evil exists only where god is not. 
3) God is omnipresent, he is everywhere.(Psalm 139:8, Jeremiah 23:23,24)
4) Evil exists. 
5) Therefore God does not exist
So, either:
1. God does not exist
or 
2. God is not the absence of evil
or 
3. God is not omnipresent

Please be respectful in your debate.
I always joked around whenever I heard Roy Orbison sing his "You Got It" song that he would have to spend a lot of money. He says that anything his girl wants, needs, or anything, he would give it to her. I knew that he was just speaking metaphorically, but it was still a little humorous to think that she could sit there and go: "Okay...I want a car, a yacht, a pony, etc." So, if Roy was truthful, he would spend a mass of money on his girl. This song is dedicated to that mindset, and to all those guys in those types of relationships.

Let me just clarify: this, thank God, is not how my relationship is with my fiance. It is just the stereotypical relationship with girls.
Sometimes things are perfect.

When you find something perfect you then realize the other experiences you might compare to, you thought were perfect, weren’t. They might have been really good or above expectation, but not perfect.

At 37 and a lover of food and restaurants I can count on one hand the number of perfect dining experiences. It takes a lot to pull it all together; location, atmosphere, food, drink, numerous employees that all have to be on target and in tune with you and your party.

So here is the place I now get to add to my perfect spots: Canoe.

Here are  the moments I want to capture (and I will not go through all of them as there many more highlights):

The grounds were beautiful. I know, grounds. I come from southern cal where grounds are the parking lot and the shrubs in front. Canoe is on the Chattahoochee river in Atlanta Georgia, nestled in a community of incredible estate homes. There is a walking path that winds through lawns with lovely flowers and plants all under the shade of mature trees.

They even had set some tables out on the lawn for a small party of 4 couples. They were right next to the water front a good 50 feet from the back porch of the building. While I was there they set up the tables and seated the 8. They seemed to really enjoy themselves and it was hard not to be impressed with this extra effort of having the wait staff travel the distance.
Early 20's and just moved from the small town to the big city. I have two jobs working in sports radio as well as at a college sports tv station in the greatest city of all, Chicago. College graduate of North Central College, class of 2008. High School graduate of Coal City High School, class of 2004. Not a whole lot else to know about me. Although I no longer play any actual sports I do enjoy pick up games of basketball and 7 on 7 football as well as being the best 16" softball player in all of Chicago. Any other questions, ask me.
Have you ever wondered what is your purpose, beyond "what god has in store for you" or whatever your religion says. Some people would say to make better in the world, but others really don't believe they have much of a purpose. My thought is that its genetically ingrained into us to drive on to do whatever is in our power to keep the race alive.

In essence we're clinging to life like some sort of single-celled life form, such as a disease. All that disease does is travel from host to host until it dies. Our "hosts" are what drives us to strive onward, for example: money, drugs, sex, the people we love, whatever you want.

With that comes Darwin's theory of evolution. If we just keep reproducing, theoretically after maybe millions of years we'd evolve to adapt to what would be essential for survival.

That leaves the question... is there a 'perfect specimen? Could we attain a level of never needing anything to survive and if so, would that mean immortality? It's an interesting question, something to ponder upon.

Once immortality is achieved, the primal need to survive will have been fulfilled. And we are still left to wonder, what is our purpose?
Well, here i am, back at home sitting in my favourite chair. Back to normality, whatever that may be.

The good news is that i did manage to drag myself out of bed at a sensible time, and even had enough time for some breakfast before we left the flat for the last time. We did go for one last look at the beach before we jumped in the car and began the long journey home.

I drove for the first hour and a half! As far as Scotch Corner Services in fact. This is, i think, the longest i have ever driven in one go, my previous longest being the hour from our house to Derby. I thought i did pretty well, and i only managed to scare Sally once - well, the bloke in front shouldn't have braked while i was checking the mirror should he?!

Saly drove the rest of the way home, and we got home around 2pm, which was earlier than we expected to - 4 and a half hours in total - a good 30 or so minutes less than we thought it would take - mind you, in the 90 minutes i spent driving we shifted a bit!! ;-)
I think that the book of Job was written for this very reason. Here we have a man who is deeply blessed of God. Things have gone so very well for him. And suddenly it all goes wrong. Not just slightly but deeply and in every way. Has he done wrong? Has he been spurned by God? No!

Job is never able to see the heavenly things. He is never shown the events of Satan's desire to tempt, and test Job. He is not shown God's pleasure in Job's upright living. He is never shown any of these things. But he is called to trust that God is in control no matter what. He is in control and powerfully good even if our feelings are wrong.

It is a beautiful test to be given the opportunity to have faith even in the depths of this dark night of the soul. We are called to yell out like Job from the ashes.

    "He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will return there. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. May the name of the Lord be blessed!” In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety." (Job 1:21-22)

Why do we think that just because he doesn't feel close that he is not close? Why do we place so much emphasis on feeling? As if it was the deciding factor in our salvation, or God's relationship to us.
This concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens't make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. I am one. Eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended!Last night hanging out with friends was awesome! Derek and I cruised through our Alma Mater, went to the mall, cruised back through, told stories, laughed, had genuine great conversation, and then met friends for pizza. It was awesome. I saw people I hadn't seen in years. My abs hurt this morning because I laughed so much yesterday. I think Derek is the funniest person I know.
And that was amazing.
And then today I get a letter in the mail from unemployment. I've been denied benefits. FML.
And tonight we're getting together for an "I have too much alcohol in my house and you all should come drink it" party at my friend Katie's house. So...it's perfect timing.
I understand that while the first few days might be typical for a class, it shortly becomes their hardest and most grueling block with the pure mass of data they require you to learn.  This weeds out anyone that can't handle the workload right off, and anyone who is  not serious about animation.  It also gives student a good strong base to start with the 2nd block, which I understand to be mostly animation and mocap.  I think 3rd block covers the more advanced features, like visual effects and green screen.  And finally, 4th block is one big long class project.  Students have very limited creativity in the class assignments.  While they are encouraged to come in before or after class, and on weekends, to work on their own projects, so they can build their demo reel up and their skills, the class itself acts more like an actual animation studio, where the directors call the shots, and the animators have to make it happen.  Therefore, we have to act like animators to make their vision come true.  Students will have some limited creativity within each shot, but the majority of it is just to make the scene work the way it should.
For those of you who thought Luke Harangody was bound for NBA greatness and never going to play a game for the Fighting Irish again, you were wrong. After testing out the NBA routine, working out for a few different teams, Harangody has decided that staying in college is not such a bad idea after all.

I'm not going to say that this is a great move either way for #44. What I do know is that his lack of defensive ability would have severely hurt his potential minutes on an NBA court next winter. He has proved that he can score in the Big East and grab absurd amounts of rebounds. However, he needs to be more of a defensive threat if he hopes to play in "the league" for any extended amount of time.

I'm not bashing Luke Harangody, the kid is one helluva college basketball player who has been as good as any in the Big East over the past two seasons. His body size puts him at an extreme disadvantage for a big man in the NBA in terms of being able to back down opponents and score the same way he does so often in Big East play.

The good news for Fighting Irish fans is that in the Big East even you are able to get away more with some of the flaws that NBA souts see in Harangody's game and that next year should be another outstanding offensive campaign for the Fighting Irish forward.
I figured while I was unemployed, I would try to do something useful. One thing I thought somebody might benefit from was a Facebook page that gives advice on finding a job. (Here's the link) Then I thought about the things going through my mind these days as I struggle to stay positive and engaged in the face of a job market that isn't exactly smiling upon those over 40. Finding a job in this economy is tough for anybody, but being over 40, you might start asking yourself things like, "Do they think I'm too old to do this?"
Well, listen, now you have a chance to prove to them that you are capable, talented, and right for the job. Some people develop a lot of negative self-talk and that negative attitude begins to show through on the surface. Not many employers can afford to hire someone who is late to work, can't spell, doesn't produce results, has so much drama in their life they aren't present at work, etc.
So you're still in the game, old-timer!
I created the Over 40 Unemployed Facebook Fan page as a place where people (you don't have to be over 40 and unemployed) can share their experience, their strategies, their job search tips, and their success stories.

I believe that in this economy, if you're over 40 and unemployed then all the more reason to work harder and work smarter. It's a chance to show how all those years of "experience" can benefit a potential employer.

And here's the logo I created for the Over Forty and Unemployed Facebook page:
Today was an absolutely gorgeous day... I aerated much of the lawns and over-seeded them as well... I will finish in the morning. I wanted it completed before Saturday as we will go from 60's back into the 30's with rain and a possible snow storm. There is way too much to water in the seeds and I will have to leave that to spring rains. I'm not particularly concerned about the cold, as magnolia buds don't appear to be swelling... at least not yet. 

I thought I'd talk a bit today about fall planting....why plant in the fall? The answer is a simple one... deals, deals, and more deals!! ... and when the deal isn't to my liking, I simply say... 'Let’s make a deal'... and frequently they do. Let's discuss this past fall for instance. Below is a whole lot of plants that I got for 50-75% off. This particular nursery was having a sale and not discussing lowering the prices any further.... but they were cheap enough to spur me into the purchase. The downside is that there was no warranty... then again, I seldom lose a plant that has been carefully chosen. A good shot of rooting hormone and they seem to take right off!
Bella is over the chicken pox. She returned to school today. All said, it was a very manageable case. Not super-mild, but not super-bad either.

Perhaps it took having the chicken pox to nudge Bella over the edge of readiness to ride a bike without training wheels. In the midst of the pox, she asked me to take the training wheels off. She practiced coasting in the driveway. The next day, she was getting the start-off and some wobbly pedaling down. Yesterday, she had nailed it. She's still perfecting the brakes, but she has completely mastered the start-off, pedaling, and steering.

Now it's time to get her a bigger bike. As you can see in this video, hers is too small. I'm not sure if she'll get one for Ayyam-i-Ha, which is less than 2 weeks away. It might wait till her birthday in June. Although with us packing up to move, she might get a "bike coupon" for her birthday, redeemable in whatever city we move to.
One of the reasons is that we are all different.

When we hear someone telling us something difficult they are going through, we usually think, "Well, I would do this, and things would be fine," but we aren't the other person.

It happens alot with disagreements, too. We think to ourselves, "I would never do that to someone else." True, you wouldn't but they might.


Empathy is moving our "self" filter that we see life through aside, and trying to understand where the other person may be coming from.


I admit, I am the worst person when it comes to putting my emotional response on hold, and trying to understand where the other person is coming from. Did I grow up with them? Did I have their parents? Their family? Did they have any issues along the way that may effect the way they deal with difficulties?

My wife got exasperated with my Male, "fix the problem" response to her issue, and told me to, "Just listen". I'm better than I used to, but I still react in my Male DNA way. However, empathy is more than listening - it is taking a step or two to understand where someone is coming from.

Do you have a friend/family/co-worker that seems to be constantly involved in the same issue or situation. It seems like they are on a racetrack life path that takes them around and around through the same situation. To me, you have two ways to deal with it;
I follow a lot about politics and I despise, yet appreciate the strategy behind the rhetoric. However, I don't know if I've ever been more disgusted by a blatant attempt to mislead followers into a false sense of appreciation than what Metallica is now attempting to do on YouTube.
After having spent years suing any fan or distribution outlet they could find who mentioned their work online, they have now taken the obvious plunge into the realm of  "if can't beat 'em, join 'em" with the hopes that fans won't realize their record. Watch Lars choke back his resentment of his publicist in the video below.
Seems genuine enough, don't you think? Please, stop spending money supporting this band. They are the epitome of why the recording industry is missing the point and destroying itself by mistreating fans. They are now embracing tools they have fought against not because they believe in them or appreciate what they facilitate, but because they see the possibility of the revenue it will bring them. Makes my skin crawl a bit.
This is purely an opportunity for me to stand up and admit I was wrong. A couple of seasons ago I would watch Arsenal play and spend a good 80 minutes of the game going: 'We need to get rid of Denilson, Eboue and Song they're absolutely awful. Why can't Wenger see that?!' Now I only spend 20 minutes of the game complaining, and that's only when Denilson's on the pitch.

Since Song has been suspended we've looked decidedly dodgy in the middle of the park. Yes of course that also has to do with the absence of Fabregas (and to some degree Ramsey), but Song has grown over the last 2 seasons to become a talented rock of a midfielder and he has finally come into his own. He's taken on the role left by the ridiculous departure of Flamini (who?) and we are a weaker unit without him. Yes he has his shaky moments where you're left asking why he made a forward run leaving a gap at the back, or when he puts the ball out for a Stoke throw when he could have passed it back to Almunia. All in all though my faith has been restored in all things Wenger. He is with the players day in day out on the training field and I am not. Everybody was questioning his re-signing of Sol Campbell. It's now officially the best signing of a quiet January transfer window. Without Sol we probably would have lost at Stoke.
In the fitness and nutrition field it's vital that you continue to educate so science doesn't pass you by. New research is reviewed and released almost every day that can have a lasting effect on your programming, so where do you go to keep up?

I link to many of my favorite sources on the sidebar, but there are a few that haven't made it up yet. Here's a short list of some that I've found educational:

The Fitcast : http://thefitcast.com/
I've been able to listen to snippets of their podcasts on my short drive to work, and the knowledge that Kevin, Leigh, Dr. Fass, and sometimes Tony bring to the table is wonderful. Weekly interviews with top industry professionals brings the listener several different views on varying topics. It's also great that, should I feel the need, I can just drop them a few questions to answer on the next episode. Go ahead and subscribe to the podcast through iTunes and see what it's all about. They each have their own blogs that I've found to be very informative.
A few days ago I showed Ronald and Cale...two eight year olds that are rapidly becoming a pain in the ass...how to make tin can telephones. They come around often now wanting to know about more 'new' and 'neat' things.

    Today they discovered my bomb shelter...yeah, I got a bomb shelter here; a real built in maybe the early fifties bomb shelter. Underground over there  to the north thirty-six steps away from the house; just a big concrete box in the ground with a steel door, concrete steps leading down, air pipes and such sticking out of the top.

     Ronald and Cale were tagging along behind me this afternoon and fate led me over that way.

     "WHAT"S THAT?" hollered Cale, staring down the shelter steps.

     If I had been hooked up to a lie detector, I'd have said the same thing: "That's where my vampire lives," I said.

    There is no electronic instrument on the market today that could have measured the speed with which two young set of eyebrows shot up at that news, and I swear the temperture dropped a few degrees from the cold chills running up and down a couple of small backs.

    My offer of letting them go down there and peep in at my vampire was flatly refused. Ronald and Cale are of the modern world; they know not to screw around with vampires.

    But if the cops show up here any time soon inquiring about vampires, I'm gonna know right off the bat who ratted me out.
Most everyone around the world is prejudice in different ways, some more extreme than others; but no matter how extreme the prejudice is it will always have a negative effect. People have always had and will always have their differences, but we do not have to be so ignorant and discriminate against different ideas, races, sexual orientation, or religions;(even though most denominations cause discrimination themselves.)Though I also don't agree with people slapping other people in the face with their life styles. Whether it be a racist not treating one person as fairly as the other for obvious reasons of being a racist, or a very religious person telling you what their beliefs are for the consequences of your actions while trying to convince you that they are right about what they are telling you.

Now I know why Cats kill Birds... 
Current mood: unwanted 
I don’t know what it is about the Birds but it seems like there's not enough room in their nest for me. Not only that but in their eyes the old wise owl is losing her wisdom and had led a cat into their tree. 
That’s not the worst part though... Mother Hen speaks of me as the creature. She speaks to me of me and see's me as no more than a nucience. I feel so ashamed and poorly of myself for I do not want to disturb the nest. All I want is to find a home. Not only a place to live, but a place I prefer to spend my free time instead of trying to find ways to stay out. A place where I am appreciated and loved for who I am, what I did, and what I am going to do. Instead, I am swarmed by Birds who claim that the cat is untidy and do nothing but stay around and eat. To me, their harsh continuous churpping hurts me more than a step on the tail. All I want is to forget the past and work for my future, but it seems even birds can’t do that...
Like i used to disgard people coming back complaining of pain after a hernia op, asking for lots of painkillers, until i had it done myself and geee, i started to appreciate the real pain; since then i always believed in people, apart from the occasionals who are blatently whingers.

I have thought nothing of the nausea of Mefloquine as an anti-malarial until ... about now. I have just taken one tablet 2 wks before flying away to Kenya and already i am feeling.... soooo sick, not yet a vomit, but sick. Im feeling the tablet blubbling up and burning in my stomach and i keep on burping. May be i shouldn't have taken it with an empty stomach.

This concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens't make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. I am one. Eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended!
Come, stain my skin. splash the puke you waddle in on my bare back and burn its stench on the parchment with the glowing cigar with smell of steak, drawing smoldering pictures of broken chains and fucked up dreams burnt with jagged edges on the skin and when you burn out the cigar stub it out and flip me over and bite my nipple to suck up the red ink and write more, write bold with your tongue till I drag your head up and kiss you hard claiming the blood that is mine. back.
A couple of weeks ago, I was waiting at a traffic light, when a frantic woman came to my window saying she and her family had broken down on the highway; Could I help? She needed money.

I dipped into my pocket and found a $20 bill and handed it to her and moved on, leaving her behind.

Did she break down? I don't know. Am I a wuss for giving her the cash? Probably. 
But, something has happened to me over the past few years. I've learned from my failures that my successes are not that important, that it's important to stay in the mindset of failure, to be empathetic of those who are not as fortunate and to remember that success is often lucky.

So, as I looked at this, I wasn't going to judge. I was going to help.
I loved reading about Vijendra Singh - the boxer who became popular after winning an Olympic medal this year. Here is very good write up on his life done by INDRANI RAJKHOWA BANERJEE from Times of India. Here we go!

A rugged village boy who rubs shoulders with the swish set and flirts with Bipasha Basu, Olympiad boxer Vijender Singh is aware he is an outsider. He is proud of his rustic roots and fights prejudices with charming confidence and a quiet dignity.

First things first. What do you look forward to when you set out to interview a hot-blooded Jat boxer? You would expect him to look you over and size you up mentally or probably greet you with a few colourful expletives... especially when the guy is a 24-year-old basking in newfound glory. But this one is different. He throws a disarming smile as his eyes meet your eyes and stay right there! That’s Vijender Singh Beniwal for you, India’s lone boxer to have won an Olympic medal.
I am becoming intense. It isn't a goal. I don't have a plan toward achieving intensity. It's an observation.

I didn't start out this way. I was laid back and relaxed for what I think was most of my life. In fact, there was the time my golf coach encouraged me to develop a temper and some intensity. A Sr. Minister with whom I worked said I didn't take my mistakes seriously.

A lot has changed. I've changed. I am becoming intense.

So, I am looking for peace this coming week. I am intentionally seeking silence and peace. I will listen more and speak less. I will think before I react. I will be less intense. I will practice the Divine Hours. I will remember serenity. I will look to be more at peace.

I make a promise to myself.I seem to march into quandaries. I don't think I do it consciously, but the result is the same as if I willfully looked for trouble. It worries me.Tomorrow is the primary here in KY. It's irrelevant at this point it seems. The DNC has really messed this whole process up to the point to where a stalemate was bound to occur. Still, I am going to the poll tomorrow and I will cast a ballot. I can't bring myself to believe that any vote is irrelevant in a nation that depends on participation.
So, by now, I would imagine that if you are reading this, you've probably heard that I am no longer in the Kendalville-based metal band, Forthcoming. Well the rumors are true. I made the decision about a week ago to part from the guys, and get my life on track. There’s still some uncertainty in my head as to how I stand in the eyes of everyone else in the band. Here is how I see the situation:

   I am a devout christian, and everything Forthcoming stands for is based around Christ, and I love that aspect of the band. Second, I couldn't have asked for a greater group of guy to perform with for the year I was in the band. I learned a lot from all of them, and looked to all of them like family. Being the youngest in the band by quite a few years, I got to pretty much experience having 3 older brothers that I didn't get to have growing up. Joe, Jeremy, and Jake, no matter what, I'm always going to love you guys. I want you to know that.
I'm getting older every day and I am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible. I am Husband to 1, Daddyo to 5, Grand (Poppy) to another 5 (so far). I use Nikon Cameras and Lenses ... but I really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with ANY kind of camera.
Photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life. It has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation. I am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself. I think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos I capture and in effect "see through my eyes" but for a moment.
Thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement. I hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills. All of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way.
God bless you all.NikonSniper Steve
After weeks of planning the day is finally here. Yesterday we hung the decorations and started getting everything ready. The party starts tonight at 7PM. You can grab some food at the Grilled Cheese Truck which will be parked outside. Inside Japan LA will be lots of Mr Toast products to check out, including a new black Shaky Bacon shirt which was printed up at the last minute by Monkey in a Dryer!

Next door to Japan LA is the Mr Toast Party Space, a whole empty store to hang out in. We will have a DJ, free Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and even Mr Toast hanging out so you can take you picture with him. It should be a fun, wonderful, silly event.
I admit that I fall for girls pretty easily. And that has been the cause of many of my relationship downfalls. I think that many women believe that when I open up my feelings that strongly to them that such things aren’t sincere, that this is a product of loneliness. I can’t really blame them. I too have been skeptical of such things when directed at me. And a look at the myriad of different personalities of significant others of my past and I begin to even doubt my own sincerity.

But I believe what it really is about me is that I have a tendency to look deeper into the person, to sympathize with their shortcomings, and to fall for the person that I know is in there. I feel that with an open-mind, I can grow to like or love anybody with time. Maybe that's my inner counter-culture flower child speaking. It doesn’t help my situation though. I easily make friends and lovers but I can’t keep an intimate companion for the life of me.
I have the idea in my head of what I want the completed piece to look like. However, as this is my first attempt at such an endeavor, it is, as might be expected, taking an inordinate amount of time. At this point though, I'm comfortable enough with my rate of progress to post up the original and declare that soon, the finalized or near-finalized version should be up as well.

I hope you enjoy looking at my art, and if you'd like to see more of my abstract designs or rough sketches, please let me know!
Anything Box
I collect things that I think are neat or interesting, and I place them in an empty harmonica box in a drawer. Recently I was talking to somebody who wanted to see them so I subsequently took this photograph of all the bits in there. I think it looks pretty neat.


Photobucket


I will explain what all the items are starting from the top.

The four steel towers at the top are tapered roller bearings from a wheel bearing of a truck. They're made of extremely hard steel which is one reason I kept them. As an experiment, I placed these four in alternate directions between two hard drive magnets. After several months, when I removed them, the atoms had been realigned and the bearings are now notably magnetized.
So yesterday was my first weekend shift. It was from 12PM-11PM, but I didn't show up until 3PM. Lol, it had completely slipped my mind. I had woken up around 1PM and made breakfast and stuff. As I got out of the shower, I was like, "Holy shit, I was supposed to be at work right now". Needless to say, I got dressed and drove to work.

I was assigned to a new trainer named Lauren. I think she mentioned that she trained Katherine, not entirely too sure on that. Anyhoo, Saturday was a pretty lax day comparatively. I had begun to practice documenting on a notepad and then entering in the computer system. I'm getting the hang of it, but there's still so much to learn about the whole thing. I met a lot of new people on Saturday. I guess it was because that's when most people worked, considering they are around my age but a little older.
The honorable mention of the day was a girl who came in complaining about abdominal pains. The killer here is that she said she was mainly having cold symptoms like runny nose and congestion, but nonchalantly mentions the fact that she hasn't pooped in a week. She also said that was normal for her. O_O Didn't poop for an entire week! Wouldn't you be a little freaked out by that?! I just about lost it. I couldn't get over it...I still can't.

I also think I had drank the most coffee in one day than I ever had in my life. It was three cups. It wasn't because I was tired or anything. Caffeine has minimal effect of me. The coffee just tasted sooo good. In the physician's lounge, scribes are allowed to go in on the weekends because it's not as busy I guess. Anyway, they have coffee machines that have these little one-cup packet thingies that you insert into the machine. I forget the brand name of them, but they taste amazing.

That's pretty much I had to say about Saturday I guess. It's harder to blog about it the day after, I suppose. Anyhoo, until next time.
First group of onions planted...

Sudarshan Suryawanshi - IDE India - Drip Irrigation Expert - visited our farm yesterday...
Sudarshan said we are doing better with the IDE Drip Irrigation systems than the two major Agri Universities in Honduras...
We held our first meeting of Honduran Campesino farmers at our Center of Operations...

We are receiving reports of how there are those who hold top positions as Agri directors for major Honduran NGO´S...
Who do not want the IDE systems at our farm...
Hah!
You will not stop our work...

I have said for years...
The help must go directly to the organized Honduran Campesinos...
Most of the Agricultural NGO´s in Hondurans are dinosaur institutions...
Who only promote sustainable famine projects...
Six years later I lay at night and think about love and I have moved on to find happiness cause that's what she would have wanted. There is some one that I do love now, and would give her my heart. I know I'm not handsome or the man that I was 6 yrs ago with my looks. But my heart is big and kind. I would never be mean to her nor make her feel sad or down. I would give her the world and so much happiness if she would be mine. I know she's been hurt and afraid but with me I would protect her and be there every day. I lay awake and count the stars wondering why I've been alone for so long. I would give her my heart cause its who she is that I care so much about. For my heart beats for her. I just wonder if her heart will beat next to mine.
What can you say about a fertility doctor who detonated a twenty-ton hydrogen bomb?


Quite a bit, actually, and most of it good. Juliet is one of the more accomplished characters in the Lost universe, male or female, and a lot of what she did doesn’t seem to have any significant connection to her gender, unlike being a love interest (like Kate), a mother (like Claire), a dedicated wife (like Sun), or a bullet-riddled corpse that men can shed tears over (like Shannon, Ana-Lucia and Libby).

Before I get into it, however, I’ll point out to anyone reading this series for the first time that I was inspired to look at how gender works on Lost and whether the show’s female characters seem to suffer especially dreadful hardships in comparison to the men. I was motivated to consider this after reading and the A.V. Club’s review of the “Dr. Linus” episode. The article suggested that women on the show do get screwed over, and I’m starting to think that it may be true.

Here are the previous posts that focused on Lost’s ladies, with a quick summary of whether the character in question got put through the ringer:
As an undeniable WASP whose North American ancestry goes back to the colonial period, I usually keep my opinions of Israel’s behavior to myself.  Such is my concern for the typical whiplash from many of my fellow citizens who remain ensconced in a sort of Israel-right-or-wrong mindset.  But in the current Israeli issue before the US—Israel’s continual building program’s encroachment on Palestinian land—while we are sacrificing treasure and lives in the Middle East and continue to suffer financial stress at home, I am unable to keep my mouth shut.  Israel’s recalcitrance mit gewalt, so to speak, is insane.
Falling awake between the vastness of time and space
Burning alive surrounded by boiling skin
Perpetual nosebleeds pouring blood out the rim
Mentally wiped out from the world's rat race.

Lingering in limbo between insomnia and hibernation
From this place I need liberation
For sleep is where I begin thought cultivation
Germination of motivation for my imagination.

Without sleep our minds are more open to be manufactured
The elite lulling you into the facade of the rapture
The brain stuck inside a cell, captured
While our ability to learn the truth has been fractured.

But I digress from this stress before creating a mess. If I could I would regress to words previously at my access. But as for now I'll express myself to excess. The living game of chess to which we obsess will diminish your finesse and halt life's progress. Yes I transgress, to which I confess with true success. Nevertheless, the human race is a damsel in distress held steady by the "freedom" of the press. Once this is posted, I'm sure they'll already have my address.
I only have to be in a sunny beach side resort for a few days and I start to believe that I understand the local culture, respect the traditions and customs – 8 days into a holiday and I’m looking at property prices, wondering how I can give up the rat race to rent deck chairs out on the nearest beach – oblivious of course to any hidden social, political or environmental considerations that disappear under the protected and surreal atmosphere of sunbathing, swimming, restaurants on the beach, and wearing shorts and open toe sandals.

So given this, I am normally very patient with this kind of conversation from ‘newbies’. After meeting your 10,000th person who knows all about the country you live in you adopt a skill I refer to as “hearing without listening”. So I was surprised when something really upset me during the conversation I was having with this particular women. I wont embarrass her or me in releasing her name, but this was the anchor lady from a UK TV News program, a very famous, well educated, well dressed, well travelled, Porsche Driving (That may give the game away to people who know her) alpha female – the type that would eat you alive, and leave most men in a jelly like state after her whip lashing tongue had finished destroying any male ego you had the audacity to possess. She was like a Chinese Moon cake (I will explain in a later Blog) tempting and attractive on the outside, only to find a strong, spicy, and pungent filling on the inside.
I am honored to be here today and to have the opportunity to share this time with you. When Judge Mordue asked me to speak, I was delighted to accept. This venue combines two of my favorite groups; students and veterans. I am a history teacher at Cazenovia High School and truly believe helping and nurturing young scholars to be my reason for being. Young people like you are near and dear to my heart. With regard to veterans, I happen to be one, but that is secondary. For me, veterans are the embodiment of our nation’s virtues. They are also living repositories of history. You’re probably tired of hearing your teachers tell you that we need to learn from history, so let me phrase it differently – we can and should learn from those who have made history. Each year, I require my students to seek out and learn from veterans of our nation’s wars. How blessed you are to have veterans in your own family – I hope you will never stop learning from them.
A word to the wise, if your look in for love and havint found it, the only advice I can give you lady’s and guys is maybe you are look in all the wrong places. Maybe you need to just set back and enjoy life and they well come find you. trust me I have looked and looked and about the time I was about to give up and just set back and live life to the fullest she found me, I could be wrong but hey what’s life you can't have someone to enjoy it with right. Keep your heads up and you well find that speacle someone!!!!
It's 2010, a whole new year full of possibilities has begun. For so many people, it's seen as a clean slate to mark a starting point. For others, a desperate hope for a terminus of a crap-filled past. For the rest, it's just a date on the calendar that reminds them to do something trivial yet important, like changing the batteries in their smoke detectors.

For me, I suppose it's all three.

First, I find the old soldiers, scattered around but within reach. In the glove box, in the travel case, in the overnight bag, in the dresser. It was time to say goodbye to my old pals, sad they couldn't see any action on the front lines, rotated out, having served their vigilant duty. It was time to bring in the new recruits. Then off to the local recruitment office (AKA Abu's Gas-n-Sip) to find the replacements.

I stood there surveying the troops at Abu's. Twisted Pleasure, Her Pleasure, Shared Pleasure, Intense Ribbed... they've all had their time on the front lines. Magnum XL? I knew there was a Magnum, but an XL??? Damn, I feel sorry for that guy. I finally settle on the 3-pack "Ultra Thin" variety. Good, I could never feel anything with these before, maybe this version will make me feel like I'm actually a part of the process for once. Only a 3-pack because I've thrown more away for being too old and unreliable than I've made use of in my life. Plus, I was a bit jaded after tossing out 2 unopened family packs the day before.

Which really brings up the question: Big boxes of twelve are called "Family Packs". Isn't that a bit counter-intuitive, considering their intended function? Maybe that's what my subconscious was thinking at the time I bought the last few boxes. If I get a Family Pack, I can make a family. Huh.

So anyway, I got the ultra-thin... Not because it was Ultra-Thin (although that might be a bonus) but because it was the box with the furthest-off expiration date: 06-2014. Maybe if the stars align just right, this box will be opened before then.

Oh, I bought a Mega-Millions lottery ticket too while I was at the Gas-n-Sip. I figured I'd have better chances with that than with my other purchase.

Come on, 32!!! Win for me, Sweetheart!
Life sucks!  I hate it. Not even a new camera makes it any better.  I know now that my whole life has been a fucking waste.  I have accomplished nothing.   I'm an unemployed looser that has made nothing for himself.  Life is nothing more than a cruel joke.  HIV sure is taking it's sweet time with me and I don't expect the fucking heart attack to kick in fast enough.  Only death will be the cure for this incurable infection. 

I am sure I lost a lot of friends over this and well, sorry to say but I honestly don't care.  For most of you I'm just another coin in your collection and not one of the more valuable ones either. If you want to delete me, you go right ahead. The last fucking thing I need right now is someone telling me I got so much to fucking live for.  I'm sorry but you don't know me that well, I would actually prefer that you did delete me if this blog is too much of a downer for you. 

There's nothing left to say.......
Every day or so I shall give insight upon what I Brandon Rogers am thinking. I will not as most state what I am doing or feeling but the thoughts and stories of my mind. All things may not be as they seem. I may stray from the truth and bring out my most creative muse to entertain you. If this however comes to be please be aware that i will eventually tell you.One hand shake is a simple greating. Two is still okay if they are at the begining and end of a meeting of some sort. Three is awkward but aceptable. My only issue is when people are so nervus that they keep shakeing your hand throught out the meeting or what not. I have no problem with shakeing someones hand but I have noticed something odd. Most of my friends are female and most of there boy friends when they meet me they get nervous and so on to actualy shaking hands seven or eight times with me. Are they looking for my approval? Are they treating me like there only chance to get layed? Just an odd thing in life that I noticed. ohh well.
1. Avoid them, or
2. Do the harder thing (Which, in my opinion is always the best), and empathize with them and their issue.

You can't change anyone, but I think if you empathize, that builds trust, and you could possibly have the opportunity to offer some steps to correct the looping path away from the issue. I'm not a professional counselor (I'm think you might not be either), but caring for someone and their issue can open up your heart and mind to offer caring advice from time to time. Love and empathy can help you help others.

All this is hard. Life itself is hard, but sometimes the hardest lessons are the most rewarding.

Practice empathy. Do your best to set aside the instant platitude, listen and be empathetic.

The world is full of people going through difficult times, and if you take some times to start to practice empathy, you could have the opportunity to release the pain of one person, and that could have a positive ripple effect.

I'll leave you with this. This has happened to me. Sometimes the people that you help with empathy, can turn around and help you in a future time. We are not on this planet to be on our own, we need each other.

Have a great week. Another little distraction coming next Monday. Tell a friend. :)
Every piece of advice a father can impart on his son can make all the difference in the world. 

    Sometimes it doesn’t even involve words…

    My father came from a family where the word “love” was scarcely shared. My dad was never the one for words. He always worked long hours or terrible shifts as a coal miner in West Virginia when I was young. When the coal mines shutdown, we moved to Florida where the cost of living was higher and the wages lower. My dad worked…that’s what he did.
In his book In Search of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, Jerome A. Jackson relates that a fossil species was described as Campephilus dalquesti by Pierce Brodkorb, an American ornithologist and paleontologist.  This fossil species was discovered in Scurry County in central Texas, and dated to the late Pliocene epoch.

I wonder what C. dalquesti looked like.   Maybe a bit like this dino-bird!?  At least the colors look right. The dino-bird portrayed below is Anchiornis huxleyi - you can find more info here. 

Check out this amazing video on finding dino color in fossil feathers.
He cannot speak English, and makes no bones about it. Can we talk in Hindi?, he asks coolly as we settle down with meethi chai in an air-conditioned hostel room, which he shares with fellow boxers Vijay and Ram Singh at Patiala’s National Sports Institute. Why stay in a hostel, now? “As a child I shared a room with my brother and five cousins. We were seven in a tiny room, and now we are just three!” Uncluttered and uncomplicated. Maybe, that’s what makes him a darling of the press. Or is it his rakish, rugged charm? “don’t know. People say I am more popular than Abhinav Bindra. It’s destiny that I was born into a humble bus driver’s family. Had I been pampered with trainers and dieticians, I wouldn’t be what I am today. I am an athlete of the soil, fed on a solid diet of bajre ki roti and bhains ka doodh . “ Vijender’s roots are rock solid.

His father still works for Haryana Roadways as a bus driver. “I’ve told him to take it easy, now that we have the money. But he says the day he stops working he’ll stop living. I remember when my father used to farm a small piece of land. I helped him by watering the crops. Those were memorable days. Tilling the soil with bare hands is joy in its purest form. I think that’s why farmers have a quiet dignity about them. “ This boy from a nondescript UP village called Kaluwas, along the Meham-Bhiwani road, hadn’t seen much of life or money till destiny catapulted him to overnight stardom. Today, his days are full. He jet-sets to Delhi and Mumbai every week for photo ops, endorsement deals and P3 parties, where he rubs shoulders with Bollywood stars and society babes. This six-feet-tall charmer has also walked the ramp for Rohit Bal.
My name is Ryan. I like snowboarding, hiking, hunting, fishing... well anything that is outdoors. I am pretty straight forward. If i am thinking something i am going to tell you. I joined the military back in march and currently doing job training for the next year. I love what my job is in the military. Thats all i can say about that. If there is anything else you want to know about me just ask. Who I'd like to meet:
I have all the people in my life now that i want. I just wish i could be closer to all of them.
I truly miss "love".

Young love was a beautiful thing. It was the most comforting thing I have ever felt.

I was never the relationship type of guy. I didn't even romantically or sexually care for females. But, after experiencing so-called, "love". I don't want to be without it.

I do wish, that I had found love with someone smarter. Someone who had a brighter thought pattern. And what upsets me the most is that i had worked hard. But, it all went to waste. And now, I have to rebuild it with someone new someday. I have no patience for that. I just want to skip to a time when I have it next.

I don't want some gross ass bitch. I don't want some dumbass slutty-type little GIRL. I want a beautiful, intelligent, mellow, logical, selfless, understanding, ladie-like female. Someone who doesn't involve herself with a grimey crowed. And does not use drugs or alcohol. Someone, I can respect. Who stays covered up. And makes logical decisions and considers most to all factors in a situation. Someone who can appreciate all things and keep me happy as well as me keep her happy.

I am afraid that I will never find that. I hate that I WANT to find love again. But, the truth is, love is a wonderful thing. I don't know what else to say. I'm sure that 'God' has someone in mind for me. And has had someone in mind for me in a while. The only problem I have is that I have become very impatient and depressed. Time has become my enemy. And that is causing me issues. I have writer's block. Goodbye for now.
I was at the public library last Friday. I was working on a sermon. In a carrel across from me was a man with his back to me. I first noticed him because he was a LOUD typer. Every keystroke echoed through the library. I couldn't have been the only to notice. I tried my best to keep my mind on what I was doing but every once in a while his fingers would whirl across the keyboard and the noise would echo out. So, I would look over at him and then I noticed; he was surfing MySpace sites that had gay men in provocative poses and they were unclothed.
To each his own.
But, please, don't use a public computer for that!
I suspect he was using the library computer because there would be no record of where he was or what he was looking at. Had he been surfing those sites at work he likely would have been looking at some disciplinary action.
But, I didn't need to see that.
Please don't use a public computer for that
Impurity is the only thing that is pure. The greater, richer and so called pure things are always vulnerable to impurity. But impurity in itself is the truest of the forms. Look at the world. The corrupt hearts are so strong. Least shaken and unchanged. So mighty powerful that the world used to be a better place once with only a handful of corrupt hearts. But those handful ones had the mighty power of impurity. They spread it like the plague. Look around you. What yo ve is the invincible disease. So much so that the God's heart is touched by it and its a never failing touch.
So when it comes to war, I'm not sure how to define my stance. Overall, I'm a pacifist and think war is always wrong. New rule: Mankind never gets to say it is divinely created, enlightened or intelligent while blowing the shit of another country. 
But...
I know fighting can be inevitable. Even the Tao Te Ching refers to defending oneself and, let me tell you, I embrace this philosophy as wholeheartedly as I do my pacifism. You take a swing at me buster, you best prepare for some knuckle sammies. Not very Christ-like I suppose but a) I'm not a Christian and b) modern Christians rarely follow this admonition anyway.

Now, some will argue that war and defending oneself is much the same thing. They see war as a good thing, a thing to be practiced often. Peace is not an option; only killing and bloodshed. They revel in this power. These sorts of humans brag of "military might" and having "the best trained, finest Army in the world" just as Napoleon did or Caesar before him. They lust for fighting and dominance, dominance over the whole Earth. Does it truly make a difference if these mad men are Americans and not Germans? Since when is killing and destruction a virtue to anyone but the fabled denizens of Hell itself? War is a poisonous goo filling their hearts and thoughts with taking a hill or planning bombing raids never mind the collateral damage.
That's what I just don't get or put my head around. How can one delight in the slaughter of war? But it is so. I see it daily. There are millions of my fellow Americans who see war as glorious and divinely sanctioned and are proud to send our soldiers into death, cheering along like Roman cheering gladiators into the colloseum arena. 
War is not sport but it has been transformed into one in these modern times where we can watch the participants play on Youtube or CNN. It's like a live action video game except when our soldiers die they don't get to hit the reset button and try the level again.
So I'm in the corner tavern the other day, listening to these two enlightened, albeit, not very educated, idiots debating the need for a national health-care program.
   Why is it that every booze hound is an expert on political issues? I go to the bar to drink, not talk, and certainly not to debate current affairs!!! I think from now on, I'll just stay home and drink in the privacy of my own home.
   I really hate people, especially idiots and morons.......and pretty much everyone else!!!!!!!!!!!
   Assholes!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m still writing with my lucky pen.

It’s been broken in half for a long time now but the ink still makes words.

The words sometimes cheer or bring despair; sometimes the rant gets caught in my facial hair.

There're holes in my boots and there's holes in my life but that just lets out the shit.

I’ve yet to see a wise man stand in my shoes, and see the light of day from my point of view, but perhaps I’m just not wise or I’ve soap in my eyes.

I try to keep away from the things I despise but they just follow my feet like I was so much fresh shit and they’re so many flies.
Hello, NikonSniper followers. Well, my trip to the Los Angeles area is coming to a conclusion. That's right, dear ... I'm coming home!
One of the things I do for comfort when I am alone and away from my family for great lengths of time is to listen to sermons online. I know, I can almost hear you shouting "BORING"! OK, OK, some of you are about to quit NikonSniper for good! You've heard enough. I have just proved to you that I am completely looney!
Well, some of you know I was a bit of a creative kid. I was A.D.D. before being A.D.D. was cool! So I was, ... let's say, a bit of a handfull. For those of you who are new, here's a little Background to give you an idea of what kind of rodeo clown I was when I was a kid. Anyway, I tell you this so you don't go around thinking I have my head in the clouds with no clue of the real world.
Anyway. I was raised in a Christian home. More than that, ... my father was the pastor of a large church that we attended (sometimes in handcuffs). Oh, please don't cast me as some kind of religious fanatic. In fact, truth is ... I don't believe in religion whatsoever. I believe in a person and YES I know Him. And that God-man is Jesus.
Anyway, ... I don't want to scare you off ... because I DO completely respect your views. Here's what I wanted to say.
I find that as I age (get more older and more wrinkled-er) I appreciate nature more. If you would have told me when I was 30 that I would enjoy photographing butterflies one day ... well, I woulda told you that you were a complete ding-dong (probably not those words though). I so often feel at peace when I am sitting on a bench watching God's wonders. Like seeing wild deer up close just staring at you, giving you a close look, like they were sent to you. Well, I recently watched a sermon about the Christian in nature that I enjoyed called, "Is God Green?" You can hit the link and watch it if you like. It's good! It is by one of my favorite speakers named John Ortberg from Menlo Park Presbyterian Church in Menlo Park, CA. He won't bore you!
Go on, give it a listen ... I dare ya ... it's a risk free way to tell your mom that you went to church. Pastor Ortberg speaks on how we are to respect the world of the Creator.
Today I shot two portraits. Both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. I just couldn't get them to go right, I was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and I am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. I have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today I feel a bit like a hypocrite. I shot this photo of the Cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. I didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while I grabbed my camera. There is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. What worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. Weird.
Monetary values change as consciousness changes. Prosperity Consciousness is Higher Consciousness because it is an expansion of the projection of the individual mind unto infinity and that is the reason why Yogi Bhajan taught us for the first ten years about meditation and yoga to help us heal ourselves, physically and mentally and then he started teaching us prosperity consciousness because it becomes more obviously important for one to become prosperous materially as one progresses spiritually. Yogi Bhajan was such a master that he was able to teach us the importance of this. If you look at any other spiritual discipline, you may or may not find this. As spritually aware people who are also conscious of our physical health we must balance all aspects of life. that is what yoga means to find the balance in all things.
…And as the rain fell brilliantly against my window on a Saturday afternoon I noticed a pattern within the glitter of the rain drops.  The pattern was of a face that I recognized as life and we stared at each other.  We wanted to see who would be the first to blink and neither of us wanted to be the first one to give in.  What I noticed in life’s eyes were my many sacrifices as I have had to hurdle the jump ropes of reality in order to live dreams without having to close my eyes.  And in this life, my life, I have suffered to be able to smile; I have cried to be able to enjoy my fate.  Acceptance is our greatest sacrifice I’ve come to learn because until we accept our challenges we aren’t able to come up with a game plan to reach our goals or to stimulate our own identity.
That's the second book in Timothy Zahn's trilogy.
I bet y'all thought that I'd forgotten about you concerning our fun trips. I realize that it's been a while since our vacation, but I might as well post the pictures that I was planning. The delay has been caused by our Village Missions conference and my presence here at Zachary and Brenda's house. Hopefully I'll be able to post some pictures of this fun soonish, but until then, without further ado, the unveiling of our Seaworld pictures.
I'm a big fan of the Orcas. They are much more majestic than their cousins: regulation orcs.
I was pretty sure, beforehand, that whaling was illegal in most states these days, but I certainly enjoyed my portion.
There's a likelihood that I was a bigger fan of the Belugas than of anything else. For whatever reason, the all-white whales (or the all-black Pilot Whales which I have no pictures of) just greatly entertain me. Perchance my monochromatic preferences reflect my worldview?
Here's a good pic of Emily and her Grandma looking at said whales.
There are two types of fall guys; one who willingly accepts responsibility for something he didn't do, to cover for those that did. And then, there's the other, who gets blame for it, because the one who actually did it, doesn't want to be held responsible for it. Either way, someone at the end is left holding the bag while the bad guy gets away.

Truth of the matter is, fall guys can be found in all walks of life. In the corporate world, in the politics of Washington, in the world of espionage, love triangles and even mostly in the world of organized crime.

Sometimes fall guys are not just about one, but about many. That’s because in this so-called fault game, the notion becomes many and the more the many, the more confusing. The more confusing, the more difficult it becomes to find the truth. Who to blame and who to be held accounted for.

 We live in a world of good versus evil. The fall guy is made out to be evil. When reality tell us that evil doesn't really exist. Because good prevails all and evil is simply a lack of. Evil becomes our creation. And in the end, its really all about us. Since we are to blame for its existence.

So in the end there is and always will be a fall guy. When the finger is pointed at who? It should always be pointed at us.
Alone for so long walking down the path of darkness with a lamp to guide my journey of life, the fates gust by the light goes out and I stand alone in the darkness wondering why.I continue to walk down the path not seeing anything but shadows and figures that speak of evil of man.

I pray and hope for an angel to walk with me as a guide and friend, soon in the midst of the darkness a glow begins, a path is laid before me showing me a place to call home. As I walk down this path I come upon a woman with a bright smile that let's my heart know all will be good. at first she was a stranger who offered nothing but kindness and love.

My angel shares her heart and pain with me as we walk beside each other on this path. I never knew of such kindness and love, a mother’s love I never known the scars and fears that led to the dark path I took. Slowly the angel became my best friend and mother. Thankful for the blessings and kindness she gave to me. Through are pains together she has loved and stood by me, its fate that the woman who lost her son found one and the son who never had a mother found his. The path is brighter and easier now that my mother angel is with me .I has found peace in my life through the love and friendship of another who was hurt and lost likes I. My mother angel is my guardian, my keeper, my mother and best friend. I thank god for the blessings I have in this path I take. My biggest blessing is the mother I've found to me that's the greatest gift of all.
It was a scavenger style race with checkpoints throughout Boston and the surrounding neighborhoods. At each checkpoint you would be given a task to perform "find 5 pounds of stuff, carry it to the finish," "find 10 pounds of stuff," "find something that cant fit into this envelope" etc etc. The idea was that by the end of the race we and our bikes would be covered in random objects and whoever had the most interesting stuff and the MOST stuff by the end of the race would win a prize.
In the end, I finished the race 7/52 racers in about 3 hours with 40lbs of crap on me--which turned out to be good but not nearly enough to beat the eventual winner, Joshua, with an amazing 100lbs of junk hauled in on his cargo bike.
The race was followed with a BBQ and bike games, all in all a very fun time that I hope to repeat again in a few weeks at the next race!

I am creating this blog in pursuit to put more laughter in the world. Not only will I post my own original parodies, but I will also introduce you to other parody creators. I will introduce you to parodies in all forms—songs, video clips, stories, and books. Stick around and I promise you’ll get a good laugh.

Mostly, I will be posting parodies that I made up in this blog. From time to time, I may review other parodies, parody writers, videos making fun of others, etc. Before I post a parody, I will first explain how the parody came to me. Often, it takes some time to explain, but it’s sometimes interesting to hear how my imagination works. Also, I know that if you have to explain the meanings of “jokes” and what not, that means that they aren’t funny. But there will be sometimes that I will want to explain certain parts of my parodies; a phrase, a verse or two.
I like birds, especially woodpeckers and MOST especially the huge Campephilus woodpeckers.  Four years ago I started a photo group on Flickr called Ivory-billed Woodpeckers and Others in the Campephilus Genus by posting a few photos that I took of a Pale-billed Woodpecker in Belize. 

The illustrious Ivory-billed Woodpecker is a member of the genus.  There are many others too, with far smaller claims to fame, with words like Cream-backed, Crimson-crested, Magellanic, Powerful, and Robust in names that suit their unique brilliance.  Our group recently surpassed 1,000 photos contributed by many individuals - a real milestone!

Now this site becomes another way to celebrate these birds.
