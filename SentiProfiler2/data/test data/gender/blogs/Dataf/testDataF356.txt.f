Formally known as Sahuayo de Morelos the town is situated in the state of Michoacan, near the southern shore of Lake Chapala. It has a population of almost 60,000 and is known for its traditional sandals (huraches) and hats (sombreros). The name Sahuayo is from the Náhuatl language, and has been interpreted as several different things; however, the favoured definition as translated by Dr. Don Antonio Peñafiel, is that is composed of two elements: tzacual and ayoti. Tzacual is an earthenware vessel shaped by half of a coconut and ayoti means turtle. Thus 'Sahuayo is 'a pot that looks like a turtle'. The turtle is the symbol of Sahuayo.
