Readers have commented about scheduling school lunch in relation to recess and how it's better to have recess before lunch.... Um... Tell me again what this "recess" is that you speak of? My school doesn't have recess. The kids get gym once a week. That's it. (Revised: the preschoolers get recess but not in the winter.) It bothers me because kids really have the need to move. And kids want to be outside even in the cold: they want to run around. With ADHD diagnoses increasing every year, it makes you wonder if we are requiring them to sit for too long. I love watching kids run around, going wild, hair flowing in the breeze, playing tag, laughing and smiling. Being kids. I love seeing their pink cheeks after gym class. That's increased blood flow to their brains! Recess in not optional. Recess needs to be required. Once I was testing a student He has test anxiety. His eyes were wide, he was fidgeting with his shirt, and his hands were trembling. We started the test and he started tanking right away. So I stopped it and said to him, "Let's do some jumping jacks!" He was confused at first, but when I did a few jumping jacks, he did some too. He had the biggest smile on his face. We sat down again and I could see that he had less tension in his body. We returned to the testing and his scores went up. A little common sense goes a long way.
