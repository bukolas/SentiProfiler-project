why do people think it's a good idea to get drunk off your keister in the middle of the week on a work/school night? I wear green regularly in my rotation of outfits and cosmetics, but since I wore green today, people kept asking me what my exciting plans were tonight. Or they told me it doesn't matter that I have to get up early and work with children in the morning. Or they just smiled and winked when I said I'm running errands and going to bed early. I have no desire to get drunk for the sake of being drunk on green liquors.
