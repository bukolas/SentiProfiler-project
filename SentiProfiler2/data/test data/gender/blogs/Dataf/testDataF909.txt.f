OK so I have been really enjoying all of the creative blogs on SITS and Lady Blogger Society (Thanks Katie), but I am finding myself lost in blogs and ignoring the family, YIKES. Any of you that have kids know what happens then. Those wonderful children know that you are ignoring them and reek havoc on anything and everything.
So I joined Lady Bloggers Society and I can not get the badge on my profile it keeps telling me there are invalid characters or something I don't know. I will try again . If anyone has any advice please let me know.

So last week I friend requested my biological father and alas he ignored. I know this because his wall is public and he recently became friends with other people but not me. Does this bother me? I don't know, I am kind of indifferent to the situation. I don't know him wouldn't even be able to recognize him if he walked into the room. I guess what bothers me the most is the situation I am in, in having to explain this to my children at some point. The man that raised me is my dad. My one and only dad, but he has his own issues and baggage with his family and did not adopt  me, which is fine with me(those that know them will know why this is fine with me). So I have my biological fathers last name but that should have left me when I got married , so you would think.
When deciding on my married name I did not like the sound of it, and I was not ready to totally give up who I thought I was of it so I hyphenated(SP?) it.  Consequently not one of my children has truly noticed that my last name is different then my parents.  Even my twelve year old hasn't noticed but I guess at this age she is just too self absorbed to notice anything but herself.  My son did bring it up in the car one day and I blew it off cause how do I explain this ?  He may be a little too young to understand.  I should probably talk to my dad my real dad not the sperm that helped to create me and ask him how he would like me to deal with it when the question comes up again.  Just some thoughts on a WACKY WEDNESDAY!!!!!
