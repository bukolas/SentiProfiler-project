When job-seeking illustrator Laura Levy first met the team of Wall Street Journal hedcut artists in the early 1980s, she was struck by their peculiar task.

"I saw what these people were doing and I thought, 'they're insane,'" says Levy. "They're sitting there all day long drawing one tiny little drawing with pen and ink.

"But it turns out I must be nuts, because it's fantastic," says the now veteran staff artist. For a newspaper that for more than a century celebrated the lack of images within its pages, it is surprising to note that the Journal's signature mark is the dot-ink portrait.

In explanation of that visually-averse legacy, former executive editor Fred Taylor famously said, "I've always thought that one word was worth a thousand pictures."

But while the paper's world-class reporting has propelled the Journal brand, it's the stipple drawing, pioneered by Journal artists 30 years ago, that has become a trademark.

"It's an icon," says staff artist Nancy Januzzi, of the miniature portraits. "It really is the look of The Wall Street Journal."

Since 1979, the drawings, or hedcuts, have become much more than the currency and certificate engravings they were modeled on. So many likenesses of prominent figures have been featured that to have one's hedcut appear in the Journal is, for most, a seminal moment.

"It sort of became a status symbol," says staff artist Hai Knafo.
