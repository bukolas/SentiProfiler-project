I have been flying for over 50 years domesticly and internationally. During that time, I have flown a lot of different airlines.Several years ago, I flew Jet Blue Airways with my daughter and grand-daughter and we absolutely loved it.Jet Blue Airways was clean and looked new.  There was actual enough leg room so you didn't feel like you were sitting in the other passenger's lap.Jet Blue provided me with many choices of delicious snacks.
