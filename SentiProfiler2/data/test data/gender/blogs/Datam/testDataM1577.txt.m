I never really did fit into the Italian schedule of things here. I usually did my sightseeing during chuisora, Italian siesta time. I headed to the beach typically when everyone else was leaving. I went out to dinner generally hours before everyone else. I visited Cagliari when it was literally empty. What can I say? I had to plan much of my biking around the heat of the day. The sun was too strong for me to sit exposed on the beach in the afternoon. And, I'm not Italian.
