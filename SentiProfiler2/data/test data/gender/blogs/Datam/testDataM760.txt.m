Painted this one at Dale Hollow Lake State Resort Park today. Stood on the deck of the restaurant. Even though it was a gorgeous day today, it was still too cool to seat people outside, so I had the deck to myself."Dale Hollow Overlook"16" x 20", oil on linen panel, plein air How's that for a title? A little knife painting of Norway for the Virtual Paintout this month."Grodemveien near Byfjorden"5" x 7", oil on canvas panel, palette knife Here's a larger one I finished up tonight. I think it's finished. Probably not though. There's a couple of areas I think I'll look at later. But pretty satisfied overall at this point.I'm adding a few detail shots as it's hard to get a good pic of the whole thing in it's wide format."Countryside"24" x 48", oil on linen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a small, quick one painted with the palette knife."House and Field"5" x 7", oil on panel, palette knife Here's a small plein air piece I did today. How 'bout that sunshine! Huh? It's about time. I walked in a creek forever, got muddy, got into thorns at different times, ended up frustrated, set up and painting a horrible mess, wiped it off, turned around and painted this. Still not great by any means, but better than the first one.
