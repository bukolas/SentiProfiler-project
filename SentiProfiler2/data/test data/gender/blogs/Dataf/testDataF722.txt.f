I would definitely recommend this computer to anyone who wants a great out-of-the-box, easy to use, reliable option that is also great looking. I have had my computer for a couple of years now and it's the best computer I've ever purchased. It doesn't become obsolete the minute I take it out of the box and (knock on wood) I've not had any problems with it since. The screen is big and very beautiful. I love looking at pictures and creating movies and slide shows with my daughter's pictures for family and friends to watch. It's easy to do, even for this computer-challenged user.
