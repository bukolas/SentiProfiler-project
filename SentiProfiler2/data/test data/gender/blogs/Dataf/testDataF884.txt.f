I wish I could say I'm strong, but I'm not. I wish I could say I can endure this, but I can't. I wish I could continue to keep my positive "glass is half full" attitude, but I don't think I can. While I've learned I cannot endure this without Him, I continue to wonder, when is it going to stop? Where is my reward for bearing with this and being so patient? Then I remember there might not be one, not on this earth. But I need to embrace and accept that. That the reward I'm waiting for is in heaven, greater than any reward I could possibly hope to receive on this earth.
Two of my greatest heroes are probably Betsy Ten Boom and Regina Lago. I had the honor and privilege of knowing the latter. She was beautiful in every way. God took her home a few years ago when she died from a brain tumor [pretty sure that's it...]. She was strong and faithful throughout her suffering, and in the end, her reward was going home to Christ. Same as Betsy. Even though she was put in a concentration camp, she remained unswervingly devoted to Christ, whom she knew was much greater than what she was going through.
