What's up, my peoples? Granted, I shouldn't have started my first review of a product with "what's up" but it's part of my personality. I decided to write a review of the iPhone because I have always wanted to write a solid review of a product for people to read and because I don't see a lot of reviews written by African Americans. Don't get me wrong: I read and respect all that write reviews or what-nots but I want to see more reviews by African Americans once in a while. This site will hopefully be a medium for such reviews.
