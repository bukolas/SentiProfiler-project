Throughout the history of "Lost," long-dead characters have had a tendency to reappear, whether through ghostly visions, flashbacks and now, in its final season, flash-sideways'. In the first handful of new episodes, fans were reacquainted with characters such as Charlie Pace and Boone Carlyle, and we know that there are going to be other future appearances as well from the likes of Michael Dawson and the enigmatic Libby.Now, you can add another name to the list â€” Rebecca Mader is returning as Charlotte Lewis.
