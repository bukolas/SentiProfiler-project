" I didn’t do that on purpose, I just like the smell of Vetiver ," Cabic said. He was sitting on a front porch before a recent show at Covington, Kentucky’s Southgate House. Cabic is a soothing presence blessed with a deep plume of energy inside of him, and it's obvious he's not the kind of musician who sees a lot of late nights on tour with too much drink. On this particular evening, he had the tranquility of a man reading a book in the sun on the first warm day of spring. When I told him I’d had a rough weekend he said, " I’m sorry, why? " in a tone implying maybe my grandma had died, or I’d had a bad breakup. A little embarrassed, I explained it wasn’t so bad. I was only trying to make the point that his music would be perfect right now – a restorative and upbeat experience like having a cup of black tea while working through a book of brain teasers, or an ice-cold Arnie Palmer on a hot and sticky day. He said people often describe grounding experiences they’ve had with his music, like the couple from Atlanta who drove to Florida and back with a van full of screaming kids. Tight Knit never left the stereo, and was the only thing that held their sanity together. But Cabic usually doesn’t agree with what is written about his music. " The way that Vetiver has been described - I don’t feel like anyone's ever really done it correctly ," he said. " A lot of times people use the same archetypes or other artists that would have been mentioned once in a one-sheet or something ." It's not that it's negative, he says, but is composed of tired comparisons that seem to be cobbled together in a hurry. "I mean, there’s some shred of kinship there sonically, but to say I sound like George Harrison does a disservice to George Harrison,” he said. " I don’t do any of the number of things that people think of when they think of George Harrison. I don’t sing spiritual lyrics, um, I wasn’t a Beatle ." And when the write-ups aren't about sonic comparison, they're usually some form of genre-chicanery. " And so my music was commonly referred to as the least-freaky-of-the-freak-folk-people ," he said. " I always thought what I was doing was accessible and poppy ." Vetiver : 3.7.10, Southgate House, Newport, KY : courtesy of CincyGroove.com ... Indeed Cabic is not a freak, and he says he doesn't make folk music – at least not on his last album. He is a guy with a work ethic using his gifts. At core of Vetiver are his voice and the songs he's so carefully gestated. Sometimes he spends a year tightening the arrangements around the track's " pop sensibility ," he said. The tightly woven tracks make for a seamless performance that can feel orchestral if he's playing with a cellist, or downright raucous if he decides to go heavy on electric guitar. Later that evening, at his Southgate House performance, about ninety audience members (in a room that fits hundreds) barely budged except for some heavy toe tapping and head nodding during Vetiver's one, long set. As he played his songs, Cabic’s mouth, shoulders and eyebrows shrank and expanded in unison like he was a conduit for some larger force, like he was expelling a grizzly bear’s soul from his somewhat slight frame. Vetiver : 3.7.10, Southgate House, Newport, KY : courtesy of CincyGroove.com ... His backing band surrounded him with energy and each song had an apex. The sum total was like a well-written story with no errant sentences: each song like a paragraph that drew me in, delivered energy, and then set me down right at the moment I was about to cave in to my urge to get up and dance. It didn’t take any prodding for the relatively small but captive audience to make enough noise to invite them back on stage for a three-song encore, during which at least a few people could be seen awkwardly trying to tug their friends out onto the empty dance floor.

The band local-released their latest album this past week in Indianapolis. The album, entitled VI , is apparently a compilation of lead singer Josh Hall's last few projects, so as you can imagine, it is a wildly inconsistent and disjointed as a release. Still, there are a couple whiskey-bar-band-ragers (this is where this band is at their best) that shouldn't be missed. VI will be available, nationally, on March 23rd through Standard Recording Company . You can try it before you buy it...Stream VI over at Musical Family Tree . You can also check out a lo-fi video of Capricorn , live from their CD Release party this past week. Thunderhawk will perform at SXSW this week at the Standard Recording Company parties .
