A Walk to Remember - When i started my Blog I swore to myself  I wouldn’t write a review for a movie ever..ever..  I broke that promise today…Shit!  Anyway while my conscience in in remission,I might as well talk about this movie and mind you ..The book too..  I read “A walk to remember” by Nicholas Sparks when i was in 11th grade…Now being the typical die hard romantic that i am ,I absolutely loved this book…For me there exist very few books that move me …emotionally..  I cried while reading this book…not many people can do that to you…I must say stirring emotions on celluloid is comparatively easier….  By far I have seen very few movies that  have perfectly adapted a book… For all those LOTR fans,they would agree the movie  adaptation was one of the best(though i can’t comment as i haven’t read the book..I know…Shame on me..!)  I also remember reading “Man,Woman and child” by Eric Segal…later realizing the storyline was used in tons of movies in various languages…(remember “masoom”??)  “A walk to remember” too was beautifully adapted…  Even After watching the movie more than 10  times now..i always cry ..  By far one of my favorite movies..  watch the movie for the book,for Nicholas Sparks ,Mandy Moore and of course for Shane west!!!  :)
