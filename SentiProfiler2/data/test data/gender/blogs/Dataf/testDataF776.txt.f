Again, I am late with this one and I am really sorry. This past two weeks is literally BUSY with work, family and relatives. I have to come to office on the weekends and work untill 12am and then come back again at 7am then work till 12am again... then a few days after was Nico's baptism. I was late at preparation. Invitations was sent out 3 days before the event. AND relatives from Qatar visited us (which i have been waiting for because I miss my nephews and niece). It was fun, exciting, memorable and tiring. Its like everyday there is always happening and its so fast and I only get 5 hrs of sleep a day. So, to make this post short, I'll describe my life as crazy beautiful! hehe!!! oh, and you are waiting for the winner of the game? :)  :)  :)
