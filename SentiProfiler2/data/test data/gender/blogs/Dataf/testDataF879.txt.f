One of the problems (admittedly, a lesser one) about being alone is that there is no one to vouch for you when you claim that every single time you get in a check-out line the person ahead of you runs into some sort of major glitch. 

It's still true, but I've got no back-up. Kyle never ever got into the same checkout line as I did. And generally, by the time I got out of the store, he'd have the truck warmed up and waiting for me at the exit. 

Now, where was I setting off to go?

Oh right. 1958. I know, most of you weren't born, but that means you certainly didn't have Mrs. Banks for home room, and that's a good thing. 
Mrs Banks was a huge bitch. Reminiscent of someone I met here on MySpace.

At any rate, that year someone new transferred to my junior high, and we quickly became friends. Her family lived in an great old antebellum house with interesting nuances like a back stairway for servants (and used by the youngest child in family when I knew them), and a button under the dining room table to step on to call the maid...of course no one appeared, but it was a neat idea.

My favourite part, though, was the fact that the front hallway telephone could be taken into the coat closet through a hole in the wall. Making it possible to talk while IN the closet. How avant guarde was that? Seemed like the height of telephone sophistication to us.

This morning my SKYPE "phone" rang, and there was my old friend, looking slightly rumpled in her bathrobe. She said, "I can't see you. Can you see me?" I said yes, but I'm not yet ready for early morning video calls. Maybe in another 52 years.
