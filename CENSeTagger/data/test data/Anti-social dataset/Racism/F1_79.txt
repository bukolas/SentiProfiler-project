I can understand why we have a lot of fascists throughout the world, I for one, have had an unpleasant experience in a shop. I was served by a black man, he then short changed me, I was very upset and called him a nigger, he then threatened to call the police. I felt extremely angry as this has never happened when I was served by a white man, maybe it was deliberate, I don't know. But I feel like joining a fascist group like the National Front as a result of this. To be honest ask any white man or woman unless they have coloured relations if they like coloured people and the answere will alway be no.
