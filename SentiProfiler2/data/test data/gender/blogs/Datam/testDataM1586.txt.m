Ok here we go. I am off the PIP next Friday. That is if I am still there. I found out in my 1:1 today that in addition to no more sick time, I have 7 hours personal time and 4 hours of vacation time. I am SCREWED!!! Per my Manager I wrote to HR to see what happens should I get sick. I think I already know corporate Americas answer but I will let them humor me. There has to be a law against this but IL being an at will state. So now I am not sure how much longer I will be working there. Sad part I actually liked this job. Starting to look now to leave on my own terms. Insurance is going to be fun as usual but we shall see and we will survive.
