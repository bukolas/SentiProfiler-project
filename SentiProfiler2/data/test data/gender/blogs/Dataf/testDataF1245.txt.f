Hearty Congratulations on your first book!! My kids and I are just waiting to grab a copy of your interesting and colourful story book. I must say that you are blessed with such a supportive and encouraging parents who have carved a niche for themselves in their own fields. I am sure, as a writer, you too will go a long way and contribute many more such wonderful books to avid readers across the globe.

God bless you. Hope to see you tomorrow 

Love,

Priya aunty
