Early 20's and just moved from the small town to the big city. I have two jobs working in sports radio as well as at a college sports tv station in the greatest city of all, Chicago. College graduate of North Central College, class of 2008. High School graduate of Coal City High School, class of 2004. Not a whole lot else to know about me. Although I no longer play any actual sports I do enjoy pick up games of basketball and 7 on 7 football as well as being the best 16" softball player in all of Chicago. Any other questions, ask me.
