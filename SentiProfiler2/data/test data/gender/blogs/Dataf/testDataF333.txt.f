(TMI alert -- I revealed this in an upcoming interview so that's why I'm posting it a little ahead of time) I haven't told you another thing: Two years ago a gastroenterologist diagnosed me with IBS (he ran lots of tests so no need to suggest additional ones). It certainly wasn't a shock; something was up and my whole family has digestive issues. I control it with my normal diet just fine (avoiding caffeine, excessive fiber, eating fresh food, etc). And then... ....I started this project. I think the processed foods have caused a small increase in digestive issues. Nothing major, but every weekend I eat a plain diet to give my body a break. Keep in mind there is an emotional component of IBS. I'm a little stressed out so that upsets my system sometimes too. That's why it's so hard for me to pinpoint what exactly causes problems. I got a referral to a new gastro and I'm hoping to get some additional answers. I'll keep you guys updated. I'm really doing fine, but I just want to get another opinion.
