The most hyped game of the year. The rivalry of the decade. Two of the all time best quarterbacks. Home field advantage on the line. There was no way the game could live up to the hype surrounding it leading up to Sunday night. They didn't hype it enough. In what will go down as an instant classic in this now historic rivalry, the Indianapolis Colts came from 17 down in the fourth quarter to steal a win from the New England Patriots, 35-34.
