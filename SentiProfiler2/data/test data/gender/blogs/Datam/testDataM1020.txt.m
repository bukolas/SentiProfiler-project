Upon entering the actual classrooms, we are confronted by an array of computer work stations, each one with 3 or 4 computers on it.  They assign all 3rd and 4th block students a computer in each station, and they have to work together to complete their assignment.  Again, I'll go into blocks shortly.  Next to this, is a small theater where they show movies and such to students, and also give lectures.  While it is nice to have it there, in their current location, it looks more like a temporary set up.  I assume this will change in the near future.  After the theater, there is a long hallway that is filled with past works they have done, including story boards, screen shots, character designs, etc.  At the end of the hallway is the 1st and 2nd block classroom, where each student is assigned a computer, which all face a screen at the front of the class.  This lets them see what the teacher is doing, so they can copy it on their own computer.  All of the computers in this school are PCs, and while they recognize that both Macs and workstations are prevalent in the industry, they find it is more affordable and standardized to just use PCs in the classroom.  They will even help a student build a PC, if they want one in their home.
Next door to this, is the mocap studio, which doubles as a green screen.  Here, they have a full sized green screen room, where half the room is a green screen, complete with props and computers and monitors.  They also have a series of mocap cameras in the room, about 20 I believe, to track movements of anyone wearing the mocap suit.  This is the same mocap system that was used in Monster House and Polar Express.
Other than these main areas, they also have a small reference storage area, full of varous reference materials, props and toys all over the place, offices for faculty and staff, a small sound room, and a meeting room I could not see, cause there was a meeting in it at the time.
Now, the entire school lasts for only 1 year for each student (assuming they don't fail).  Each year is split into 4 blocks, which are 3 months apiece.  A student is assigned wither night or day classes, which stays that way for the entire year.  Meaning the faculty have to change which times they teach classes every 3 months to accommodate the new recruits.  In the first block, you are bombarded with information, most of which is 3D modeling.
