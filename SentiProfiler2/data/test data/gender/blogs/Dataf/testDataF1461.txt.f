Today has gone well. I decided I can't just cold turkey quit smoking, so I've cut down a lot. I use to smoke a pack a day, but today I only smoked 3. So I'm hoping cutting down slowly will help me quit. I've had the taste of alcohol in the back of my throat all day but I've been fighting the urge to drink. It also helps that I moved into my mom and her boyfriend's house yesterday. They don't keep alcohol in the house. So that is helping a lot with the situation. I also moved to a new town which will be very helpful with my change. It will allow me to concentrate on it alot more. Also I can make new friends that support my decisions. Apparently there is a really good church here with a good youth group so I'll have to check that out soon. I'm hopefully going to be finding a job soon and getting my own car. This will help a lot with finding new friends.
