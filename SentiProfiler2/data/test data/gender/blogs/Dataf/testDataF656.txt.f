The fading patina of the paint and the old looking school bus drew my attention to this billboard. If you enlarge the image you can see that is stenciled on plank boards which leads me to believe it has been there quite awhile. They just don't make them this way anymore.

This little pair came up from the bottom but they don't look like they're quite ready to stick their heads out yet. Or perhaps they're asking 'does this rock make our butts look big.' As I walked by yesterday I didn't see but heard a little frog plop into the water so the pond is indeed coming out of its long winter slumber. These sights and sounds are a wonderful prelude for what's to come and I can hardly wait! For more Camera Critters join Misty here . (enlarge for best detail) These were taken last week. We actually had 72 degree weather yesterday so the snow is long gone. Yeah!! I liked how the cattails were reflected in the water along the shoreline. This was a much closer shot and when I downloaded the photos of that day I was totally surprised. It looks like I was looking through glass. It reminds me of looking through a glass shower door, you know, the kind that you can never seem to get clean. :) For more Weekend Reflections join James here . I'm combining this week's Sepia Scenes with Mary's new Yard Art on Thursday meme. Last week my dear Hubs had a checkup with his doctor and as he was driving I spotted this 'outhouse' along the way. This was in someones side yard right along the highway. I have seen this done before but not as eloquently as this one. It sits in the center of a large flower bed with lights and plants and small shrubs arranged around the exterior. Hanging plants left from the last growing season adorned one side. I thought the moon and star cutouts the defining touch. I converted the color image that's below to sepia and added some texture to make the image look like an old postcard. Last week my yard art was a huge concrete cactus that my good friend Thom thought "why do I think that is so odd in your neck of the woods." I just KNOW he will think this much more appropriate. However, should anyone think the outhouse is only indicative of American Appalachia the country of Australia for example was largely unsewered until the early 1970s with many suburbs having outhouses or 'dunnys' behind each house. That was a mere 40 years ago. For more Sepia Scenes join Mary here . For more Yard Art join her here .

This past Monday the sky was trying so hard to peek out from behind the clouds. Hubs and I had been gone all day and when we arrived home I noticed all the melted puddles of snow in the driveway. The first shot above is looking in a puddle on the sidewalk with the nearby woods reflected and a hint of light blue sky. The second shot is the sun and sky reflected in a puddle on the driveway.

Hubs and I have passed this yard a few times in the past couple of years and it always struck me as a funny piece of yard art. It wasn't until Mary mentioned a new meme that I decided it was time to take a photo when we passed it on Monday. It is along a main road with no place to pull off so I took this through the windshield. The cactus itself is made of concrete and surrounded by a landscaped flowerbed made of stone. Even without enlarging the photo you can probably see it is outlined with large Christmas bulbs. We have never been past it in the dark but I imagine it is something to see. Should you happen to go ahead and enlarge the photo you can see that on one side it is bordered with a chainlink fence that surrounds a cemetery. For more Yard Art join Mary here .
