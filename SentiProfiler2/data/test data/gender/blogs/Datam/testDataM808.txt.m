This really was a movie worth seeing. For me, there are some movies that really take me somewhere, and this was one of the movies. The scenery and photography is excellent, and the soundtrack complements the movies, terrificly. When you finish the film, you feel that you left your own life for a short while, and took a lil journey worth taking.  I am a big fan of action scenes and war scenes( when they are well-done),and this movie has that coverred. I really enjoyed the fight choreography, and how they integrate skill, intelligence, and strateg yinto the fight scenes, creating a realistic vision of the ultimate warrior.
