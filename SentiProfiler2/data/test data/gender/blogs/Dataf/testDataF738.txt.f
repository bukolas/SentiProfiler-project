My schedule is a little bananas lately. I can't seem to find time to go out at night,keep my house tidy,see friends,do laundry,watch movies or do anything that feeds my soul.  I am also craving inspiration. A person,a song,a picture,a story...just anything. If my soul isn't inspired I feel dull and lifeless and I've realized it is essential for me to be constantly inspired. I thirst for it. Eleven o' clock at night is my new 6pm and I find myself not wanting to fall asleep at night simply because I enjoy my time relaxing at home too much. I need to begin to find a balance and force a change somehow. I adore my job and I feel like all the time and commuting I do is well worth it so I just need to find a balance. I'm craving a balance.
