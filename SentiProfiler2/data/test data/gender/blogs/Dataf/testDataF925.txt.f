Well it was a normal Sunday morn'n till I see a calf trotten across the front pasture. I knew that Cowboy Steve was working some cattle down at the barn but when snot (the guard dog) was going crazy, I went to the door to yell at him to quit and there it was about a 600 pound steer.  Cowboy Steve and Cowboy Stephen both got injured while the big calf was escaping from the shoot.  Stephen our dear friend ended up breaking his ankle while they were trying to wrangle the beast to the ground and Cowboy Steve has a few broken ribs.
