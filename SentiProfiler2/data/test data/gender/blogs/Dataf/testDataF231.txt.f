Today it is the first day of spring, and for those of us in the northern hemisphere, it is the season of renewal. (For those of you in the southern hemisphere, please humor me and think back to a few months ago. ;) ) Few things make me feel as alive as when I see the first sprouts of green grass, fresh leaves, and colorful flowers taking place of the lifeless landscape that’s dominated for the last six months. Never mind that it’s not even 30 degrees where I live today (thanks, Arctic chill that blew in yesterday). Even in my frigid corner of the world, the snow is melting and the days are warmer; we’re expecting a high of 54 tomorrow, so I’m not completely living in a fantasy. Surviving yet another wretched winter gives me hope, and in celebration, I make a list of at least five things I want to accomplish during the spring season each year. This helps me feel like I’m kicking ass and making the most of my favorite months of the year. Here’s my list for spring 2010:

   1. Survive Latin 1020, by far the hardest class I have taken and must pass in order to graduate this summer. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m hanging in there, and I’m writing this here as a reminder of how important it is that I keep working hard until the very end.
   2. Upon passing Latin 1020, my next goal is graduating this summer! Even though I technically won’t finish until the end of summer semester, I still get to walk in the ceremony this May. I’m stoked.
   3. Before my family comes to see me walk, I will give my house a thorough spring cleaning. Since school started, I have only been doing the housework that’s been absolutely necessary. I’d rather not have them all think that we’ve been living like slobs since we’ve moved here…even if that really is the truth. :P
   4. I will listen to music, take photographs, write, and satiate my creative drive by making time for even the smallest of things that will inspire me every day. Carpe diem.
   5. I will consume fewer aspartame-laden drinks and, darn it, drink WATER instead! I have difficulty with this, despite my hunch that aspartame is what has been killing off my short-term memory in the nine years I have been drinking it.
