The Mughals had a dress code and would not wear the pant/shirt cause mostly non-believers would wear them. However, now a days even our so-called Islamically established states have the concept of the western pant/shirt deeply engraved in their societies. So what now? What do our youth do? A solution can be to take these western concepts and "Islamisize" them. A good example would be clothing. Take the western pant/shirt and make them longer, and looser.

As Muslims we should look decent and healthily smart, not overly dressed to the extreme. And Muslims we should not lose our identity in the process.
