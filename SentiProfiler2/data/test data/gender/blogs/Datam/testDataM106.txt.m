Of course we cannot establish whether God exists. But we can certainly observe human societies all over the world and periods for which historical records are available. I would suggest that we observe the following:

1. The percentage of believers and their strength of belief.

2. Individual experience of spiritual ecstasy.

3. The impact of faith on the material and mental well being of humans.

4. The impact of faith on morality and righteousness and justice.

Perhaps you can come up with more similar points, which would lend themselves to careful systematic accurate objective observation. I think any such observation will lead us to the conclusion, that majority of people in any society anywhere at any time have been strong believers and such belief has made it possible for the societies to run with equity and justice and individuals have been better off mentally and materially. I am sure that one will come across atrocities and cruelties in the name of religion. I think overall the positive factors will prevail. I believe survival of fittest would operate here also and faith survives proving that in general the gains are more than the losses.
