Aha, here I am again. Medicine Run-down – 90mg Cymbalta, 20mg Abilify, 12.5mg Ambien, and 200mg Lamictal. 900000 mg nicotine from my cigs I am just coming out of a major depressive bout. I must say it was a rough one. I've been drawing some though and trying to keep spirits up. I usually don't do well this time of year. From the day the time changed I have been up and down and mainly down. I think I am finally adjusting. Ive been drawing a lot. If anyone is interested, check out some stuff I did at deviantart. Its at http://sunraven0.deviantart.com Tonight we have to go to a Christmas Party. My stomach has been acting up, so I don't exactly know how I'll make it, but I will. It will probably be fun, and hey – Olive Garden is always good. Anyway, my mood feels a bit more stable. My Abilify was increased a bit, so I guess that helped. I've also been trying to drink more water and watch my wheat intake. I don't know if it will help, but hell, its got to be good for you. Hope all is well with everyone. I am trying to think of things to read and draw so any suggestions are welcome. If I draw something you suggest, I'll post it on deviantart so you can see it.
