Another view of the Maluti Mountains from Three Fountains in the Free State. For more super sky pictures go to the Skywatch site. Sunrise over the Maluti Mountains in Lesotho taken from the Three Fountains View in the Free State. Go to Skywatch for many more great pictures from around the world. These huts&nbsp;silhouetted against the sunset&nbsp;give an interesting view of a&nbsp;village&nbsp;in Lesotho. Go to the Skywatch site for more great&nbsp;photos from around the world. Make mine a dubble or should I say dubbel or is it double.......? I guess it doesn't matters. A specialist in court cases too? I think I may stand a better chance with my with my lawyer. . "Froggy, froggy may we cross your golden river?" "No!" "Why don't you rather stop for a while and admire my beauty?"&nbsp; It's amazing what you can find lurking beside the river banks. You can see the big picture or if you look more closely, you&nbsp;may see the little one as well. I came across this little fellow alongside a river in Lesotho and&nbsp;identified him as an Ornate frog (Hildebrandtia ornata). If you are interested in knowing more about these frogs click here . This is the second of my donkey sunsets taken in Lesotho. Come and enjoy the worldwide skywatch experience at the SkyWatc h site. This bald ibis vey obligingly posed for me the other day in Lesotho. I found this sign on a roadside shop&nbsp;in Lesotho quite amusing. I know what chips are, but can only guess what fats are..........needless to say that with my no fat and low cholesterol diet I was not tempted. Aside from the humour, it also shows an entrepreneurial spirit in a harsh environment, where there is a daily struggle to earn a living. This seemed like a desparate, or should I say novel,&nbsp;appeal for business in Molteno.&nbsp;I also see that some of the petals on the flower were sacrificed, to improve the view of the sign. Having just eaten a big breakfast at Aliwal North we did not stop. Then about 50 kilometres from Cradock we stopped at the Daggaboer Farm Stall to browse. For the unenlightened "dagga" is "marijuana" and "boer" is "farmer". Yes, that is the name of the farm. Apparently the name has four possible origins, but only one relates to dagga. If you want&nbsp;to hear these accounts you will have to pop into the&nbsp;farm stall and ask the owner. &nbsp;It is well worth a visit and I can highly recommend the homemade pineapple juice and ginger beer and the roosterbrood (griddle bread) And then, before resuming the journey, you can always stop in at the local loo, to have an "enjoyable farm pee".&nbsp;There is a lot of humour at the Daggaboer Farm Stall. You can also visit them on the net. At one time our travel was aimed at getting from point A to point B as quicly as possible. These days we kind of dawdle along and emjoy the ride, looking for the these types of roadside gems.
