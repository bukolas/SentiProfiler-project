Well where I start. I received my nickname "Gump" from my beloved wife Pat 42 years ago. I met her while driving my 1967 GT Mustang around town. The traffic light at the corner next to the post office turned red. This little girl with blond hair and blue eyes sitting on the steps hollered hey guy how about a ride! The rest is history as it was truly love at first sight. Forty one beautiful years later after a marriage made in Heaven ended this past February 21st at 8:05 AM as the love of my life lost her long battle with cancer. She gave unconditional love to me, our children, grandchildren and family. She was in short, the heartbeat of the entire family. This past twelve months without her is still unbearable at times. Everything that once held meaning has lost it. If I am healing or coming to terms with it, it is going very slow with still daily bouts of tears and depression. She was like a moonbeam that you could not hold in your hand, but just enjoy every minute of her presence. So I trudge on alone now living one day at a time, sometimes an hour at a time. The good thing is I still have my family who loves me very much. I have two daughters, Missy and Tina. I also have a son, Richie. I tend to lean on Tina the most. She has been taking care of me every day. She truly reflects her motherâ€™s love beyond measure. So why did I come to MySpace? Maybe to find new friends who have already made this journey. Someone to share their thoughts with me and in tern maybe I can be some help to them. I love music, poetry, love stories~with happy endings~ and life. Yes I still love life and all its beauty. I'm not sure what waits on the other side, but I enjoy life on this side. So as my journey continues until I am called Home, I'll do the best that I can do. It is the least that I can do for the memory of my beautiful wife Pat....
