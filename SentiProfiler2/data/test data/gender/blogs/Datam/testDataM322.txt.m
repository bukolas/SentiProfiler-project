Not long after Amazon updated the U.S.-only version of the Kindle and replaced it with a new international Kindle model, the company followed suit with the larger Kindle DX. This new model--now called the "Kindle DX (Global Wireless)"--runs on AT&T's network and can access content on cellular networks inside and outside of the U.S.

Aside from the switch in wireless carriers (the old DX used to be powered by Sprint, and didn't work outside the U.S.), nothing else has visibly changed--at least as far as the hardware itself goes. The 0.38-inch-deep DX is just a tad thicker than the 0.36-inch Kindle. And the Kindle DX's 9.7-inch e-ink display (1,200-by-824-pixel resolution) technically offers 2.5 times more screen real estate than the Kindle's 6-inch display. That extra screen comes at a price, both figuratively and literally, as the DX weighs almost twice as much (18.9 ounces) as the Kindle and costs $230 more, at $489.

Aside from the price, the biggest strike against the DX is a competing product from Apple. In early 2010, Apple announced that it would release the iPad, which offers a full-color capacitive touch screen that's the same size as the Kindle's monochrome e-ink screen along with a far richer feature set, including much better support for PDF and image files (the iPad also supports video playback, Web browsing, and iPhone apps).
