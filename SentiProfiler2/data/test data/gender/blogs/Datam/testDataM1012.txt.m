This is something that I have never really belonged to personally. I also think for the most part anyway this is a problem on a much smaller scale compared to the last couple topics, that eventually dissipates after leaving your high school/juvenile days behind. Yet still grouping people, labeling people, and then bashing them for ludicrous reasons is discrimination in it's child hood stages, and can still cause damage to others. I have seen first hand how the "popular crowd" really works. You're in, or you're trying your best to get in by doing everything necessary to gain acceptance. These people that try to get into these crowds usually have low confidence in themselves and will attempt to show off by insulting or belittling a different classification of person, for example "nerds", "emo", "outcasts", exc. Sometimes it could also just be the "popular" ones themselves that try to hurt others. This is considered small drama, but drama people have to live with as long as they go to school. So, something like this to the victim of this drama will build up over time...there's your damage. Not fitting in when you're desperate to, and being bashed by the desperate year round. I do realize high school isn't this kind of hell for everyone, but I'm speaking for whom this concerns. There will always be secrets, rumors, and backstabbing especially if you work your way up brutally, that's exactly how your "friends" and social life will be. 
Also another thing I would like to point out is school shootings. School shootings are often caused by these actions of immaturity. Again, if you're mean or unfair to someone consistently, it will have a terrible effect eventually. All it takes is for that person to get to their breaking point. It doesn't always have to be a school shooting; they also sometimes just kill themselves, or release their stress in many other ways. To close this up I just want to say for the wanna-be popular bitches and bastards, get over your minor insecurities, and lack of imagination or someone will get hurt!
