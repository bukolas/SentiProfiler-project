I enjoy reading everyone's comments so much. You educate me about school lunches because many of you know much more than I do. You share personal experiences that inspire me to continue. You encourage me. Thank you! It seems like there needs to be an outlet for you to share your thoughts with the small "community" of blog readers. I'm going to open a thread for you to share something with the readers. If you have a question for me, please continue to email me directly, but if you have a question for the readers, put it here. I moderate comments older than 3-4 days and I am proud to say I have only had to delete one (it was spam). I'm not afraid of negative commentary, but please don't be hateful. Great discussions include opinions from all. If the open thread is popular, in the future I'll give you a specific topic to discuss. But for the first open thread, you can decide what to chat about. Happy weekend!
