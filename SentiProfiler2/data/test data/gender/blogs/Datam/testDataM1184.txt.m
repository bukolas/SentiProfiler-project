Ornette Coleman is sitting at a table in the middle of his spacious loft, a fourth-floor aerie above the garment district bustle on West 36th Street in Midtown Manhattan.

It is a happy moment for a reporter: You hear on the radio that Mr. Coleman, the alto saxophonist and composer, turns 80 today — Tuesday, March 9, 2010 — and you call him up, introduce yourself and get invited over immediately.

You find him sitting there almost exactly as envisioned, in the darkened, quiet space, outlined in a cone of lamplight and writing away — not on music paper with staves and clefs, but rather on regular lined paper in a spiral notebook.

Are they hieroglyphics? Japanese characters? The calligraphy of the avant-garde? It turns out to be his left-handed stylish printing of notes — B-flats, G-sharps and such — arranged into strings and matrices. Such notation fills the pages of several notebooks stacked nearby.

Physically, Mr. Coleman may be perched on a high stool, dressed in a colorful print shirt, black slacks with suspenders and wine-colored loafers, but his mind is an antigravity chamber, floating in the middle of this room decorated with contemporary furniture and huge Modern paintings.
