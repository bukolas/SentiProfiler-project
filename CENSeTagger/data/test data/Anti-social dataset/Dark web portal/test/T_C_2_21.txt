Asalaamu Aleikum wr wb May Allah(sw) forgive them, reward them the reward of martyrs and grant the jannatul firdawsal a'laa, amiin as for those who commited this act: O apostates and infidels of Pakistan, you did such an act towards our brethren, brethren whom we love by hearth and mind, brethren who sold their souls to Allah(sw), brethren who stood up in the defence of their prophet(saw), in the defence of their sisters, their children and their adults. Brethren who never asked for anything of this world, but followed and obeyed Allah(sw) and his Messenger(saw). O apostates and Infidels of Pakistan, we are coming in the revenge of our brethren and sisters whom you have harmed and murdered in the worst fashion. we are coming, even if it takes us 100 years. We are coming to you with slaughter. O Allah who moves the clouds and reveals the book and is quick in recompense, defeat the troops. O Allah, defeat them and shake the earth beneath them
