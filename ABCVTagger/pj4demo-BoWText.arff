'\"Terrorists.  I don\'t think that we would be able to have 100\% clear picture of what really happened (or what exactly caused the event), but nothing justifies death innocent people.\"See question # 6.\"Nothing in my behavior changed.  I\'m just trying to enjoy life as much as I can, because 9-11 showed that nothing lasts forever.\"\"At the time of attack I was close to panic, because my husband was working in the building next to WTC.   I was standing in the traffic trying t get home, and I was crying inside, because I couldn t reach him on his cel phone.  Until he called me from home saying that he is fine I couldn t calm down.  After that I didn t really care that I couldn t get home that day, because all bridges were closed.  I was just happy that nothing happened to him.   The next day when I was driving home and saw smoke instead of Twin-Towers I started crying.  WTC was a symbol of power for me.   They were supposed to last forever.  I just couldn t accept an empty space threr.  I lost sense of realty.  I couldn t believe that something like that could happen.  I didn t feel safe anymore.  Money, career, education or other long-term goals were not important.  I was just scared that something could happen to my loved ones.   After 9-11 sometimes I feel terrified that SOMETHING might happen.  Sometimes I catch myself thinking that the bomb might explode and I would never get out from the train.    I feel that I work in the most dangerous place in the US. \"Very strong beliefs similar to the strength of conviction held by radicals in our country who kill abortion doctors and the KKK.I don\'t sleep well. I haven\'t enjoyed anything.  I am discontent and restless. I am unable to focus my energy (what little I have).  I sleep or try to ALOT.  If it weren\'t for my job I would not leave my home.\"I\'m still sick.  I didn\'t know anyone personally, but tell me that someone destroying thousands of lives doesn\'t mean for it to be personal.  I\'m angry, depressed, incapacitated, and angry again.  The stories are heart wrenching. At first I wanted the universities to shut down, business to stop, and life to pause...but I realized that if I succumbed to those wishes I wouldn\'t know when to get started again.  It is unclear to me how we can ever have closure on this...killing terrorists, bombing camps, bombing cities, recovering the dead, having a death toll, cleaning up the physical debris, healing the wounded? None of these or even all of them would not set right this country.  I was oblivious to the attack.  A staff member came in to the room where I was making copies and said,  The world\'s gone crazy.   I looked at her blankly...this statement did not seem so out of the ordinary.  Then she said,  You haven\'t heard?  and she proceeded to give me the gist of what was going on...wtc hit, 50 planes still in the air, evacuating chicago, and that was about it...but apparently Purdue wasn\'t doing anything differently. Class continued, I ran subjects in my experiments (some who knew, some who didn\'t).  Finally, I get to a computer and start looking at the news sites and discover the horror.  Immediately I begin to IM everyone on my list that is online to fill them in if they had not heard.  And I hoped for survivors.  I wanted to hear all of the stories of survival, the harrowing narrow escape, the prolonged wait for rescuers...and there weren\'t but 5.  Only 5 in the \'rubble\'.  I\'m at once moved and skeptical.  My heart aches constantly, I think I\'ve developed an ulcer, I cry (prior to this I simply did not cry).  I cry when Dan Rather cries on Letterman, I cry when Bush says God Bless America, I cry when I see firemen, and I feel guilty about all of the petty things that occupy my time.  The writing of the dissertation, job application letters, and even my field seem to go a long way to explaining what happened but little to ameliorate the affect, cognitions, and behaviors that are explained.  I\'ve been out with friends three times since the attack, and there was laughter, but it wasn\'t the free laughter of graduate students making statistical jokes, it was the laughter of my grandparents that doesn\'t use your whole heart...that holds something back for the terror, the horror.  I\'ve seen friends that seem to have aged tremendously in the last week.  I keep thinking we\'ll all get some sleep soon. But I don\'t even sleep well, not the exhausted safe slumber with pillow drool, but a restless sleep haunted by bin Laden declaring this a \'holy war\' and by my own recent lack of religiosity.  Everyone keeps saying things have changed and will never again be the same, and I didn\'t want to (don\'t want to) believe this...but it seems this is so.  I have no doubt that life will go on, but it is now sullied with impossibilities.  I don\'t remember ever being afraid, ever wanting someone to sleep with for the safety of their breathing and heart beat, I don\'t remember ever feeling limited or helpless or as though there was nothing I could do.  I know the research I thought perhaps if I bought a plant that I could water and care for I would feel better, but I can\'t bring myself to go to a store just yet.  I had two thoughts one right after another once the horror of how many lives were lost...both selfish and both have caused me guilt since then...the first was that the person I\'m supposed to marry was in that building and we had not yet met and now we never would and I would never be with the love of my life.  The second was if it was my last call and I knew I wasn\'t going to make it out alive who would I call...and I realized I didn\'t have a last call...even though I have a cell phone.  In the whirlwind of emotions these two thoughts haunt me most recurring and causing my stomach to turn and my head to ache and my eyes to tear up yet again.  What are my deepest feelings? I feel cheated, sad, angry, depressed, helpless, afraid, pissed off, somber, and on the verge of tears all the time that I am awake and I\'m certain that I cry in my sleep.  And as everyone else in this country is doing when the feelings are overwhelming...I\'ll close with \'God Bless America\'\"\"The hijackers primarily, likely bin Laden, but I find very little solace in holding someone responsible or making someone pay.\"\"Could be anyone, if I had to say, Bin Laden\"\"Hate in their hearts.  Jealousy possibly, pure insanity, who knows.\"\"I think everyone\'s opinion of the actual attack is very similar, it\'s very sad, terrifying and horrible.  Although this attack has been devastating, it is my hope that some good can come of it.  I know it has caused many people to view life differently, appreciating family and friends and life itself more than anything money can ever buy.  I know it has forced me to reexamine my attitude towards life.  This attack has made me think more about America.  We think of America as the greatest country in the world to live in, and it is quite possible that it is, I know there\'s no where else I\'d rather live.  What is so difficult to understand is how we can unite together as a country over something like this yet every day people in our country are commiting violent crimes against their fellow Americans.  I guess there will always be hate in the world no matter where you are, but I guess my point is how can we come to appreciate and unite for our country when foreign terrorists attack yet each and every day we tear it down internally.  I\'m amazed at lack of morals demonstrated in this country on a daily basis.  Maybe I\'m dreaming but it is my hope that there will be many changed Americans over this ordeal, that we will once again be proud of ourselves not only as a whole but as individuals as well and that we will demonstrate this with our actions.   I think I\'ve written more of a speech than anything, but hopefully this will help with your study, good luck and god bless.\"More appreciative of life and caring towards others\"I think the tragedy of September 11th is a sign that we as a country have let down our national defense.  We\'ve taken our safety for granted and forgotten the importance of security and military strength.  This tragedy has brought us together though, and hopefully it will lead us to build back our strengh in national defense. \"I think my patriotism has increased over the past few weeks.  I also think my attitude towards Arab Americans has changed in a negative manner.  I think the past leader(s) of our own country are responsible for the attack.  We\'ve had many warnings leading up to this event and we were naive to believe that we could relax our defense because nothing like this could ever happen to us.  Someone might do this for a sense of power or control over our country or they might just do it because they want to get back at us for something weve done in the past.     \"For the short term, I know I have been a lot more  subdued and contemplative the past week... I think in the longer term, I will be more afraid to fly, more afraid to be in the US, or in any large city.\"\"I don\'t know if it is Bin Laden, or Saddam Hussein... Or even someone completely unrelated to those two. I would have to say simply  madmen \"\"I cannot possibly conceive of a reason. Sometimes we in Canada perceive the US as somewhat bullying, but it is just INCONCEIVABLE. \"\"I can\'t imagine how any person or group of people (though groups tend to polarize) could have so much hate that they would even consider such an act... I also can\'t imagine what point they were hoping to make or how they thought such an act could actually make anything better for themselves, as presumably they felt there would be some good to come from their terrorist actions. It has the feeling of almost a  cult  because I can\'t think of any other reason, other than being brainwashed that one would want to kill oneself and take so many innocent lives with them... in fact, as many innocent lives as possible! It is simply inconceivable to me how this plan was even arrived at, and how many people were brought to agree that it was the best course of action to achieve or to work towards whatever goals they had in mind.  I do not think this tragedy affected only the USA either. I think it has made people all over the world, certainly \'western\' countries, feel a little (or a lot) less secure, more vulnerable. I think a little bit of innocence was robbed from a great many people. \"\"As of now, it is not entirely certain.  The media is pointing our attention to Osama bin Laden and associated terrorist cells.  I am waiting for clear evidence.\"\"It is impossible to genuinely know.  Yet, it seems that these are NOT psychological fragile people.  Rather, they are psychologically stable to some degree and able to steel their emotions even in the face of suicide and homicide.  Such people must truly believe they are doing something important enough to die for, such as a deeply held religious committment combined with experiences that cumulatively justify their convictions that the US (and the West?) should pay dearly.  Such a person might feel that their sacred places and norms have been deeply violated by past US actions...\"\"I am deeply saddened and troubled by the events of September 11, 2001.  I believe the taking of innocent lives was wrong and that nothing can truly justify what was done. I pray for those who are grieving the loss of loved ones and those traumatized by the events physically and mentally.  Lord have mercy.  As horrid as it might sound, I also believe it is important to pray for those who supported this action.  How is it that the terrorists who suicided--and those who agree with their actions--could come to such a point of view?  In what ways has our nation desecrated their sense of what is right or ignored their sufferings?  I feel we must attempt to understand so that we can appropriately respond in a just way, not a vengeful way.  I believe vengeance would serve the function of spreading a salve on our own angry wounds, rather than on responding with genuine justice.  We must not kill innocents.  If we say it was wrong for the terrorists to kill our innocents, then I believe it is wrong to kill other innocents in an effort to respond to these events. There is much to say, but I will stop here.  \"\"I am praying even more about world events.  I am talking about, thinking about, and watching/listening to the media re: topics related to the attacks.  I am contemplating mortality and what is worth living and dying for in a deepened way...\"Osama bin Laden and his band of fanaticsi\'m still walking around in a fogwhy indeed\"Being a US citizen, and a New Yorker, this is my perspective. Life changed drastically and forever in a brief instant. Suddenly we are cast in a horror movie. Ophrah said is best yesterday at Yankee Stadium....trying to find the meaning now in our everyday lives.\"\"I am horrified and frightened that an attack of such a large scale could happen here.  The way it was done, plotted and methodically planned, with many people involved who have lived here for years and taken advantage of our training and hospitality and many opportunities, is particularly outrageous.  I do not believe my life or that of my family or any of us will ever really be the same. I lived in Israel  during the war in 1973 and found it a frightening time, with many difficult experiences.  When it was over, I could come home and be safe.  This is my home, and there is no where I could go to be safe. At the same time, while I support any action to retaliate against proven terrorists, there is nowhere to place blame beyond those individuals.  Nothing would horrify me more than to see justifiable range inappropriately vented on decent Americans and international students because of their ethnic background.  That would be a greater victory for terrorism than the loss of all our lives. I am a mental health professional.  At no time has the line between myself and my patients been more fuzzy.  We are all human beings, suffering in this together.  The first day, I was a wreck.  Very anxious and symptomatic and just wanting to gather my family in a safe refuge.  The next day I went to work.  I opened my office door and looked at my chair, behind my desk.  I said to myself,  that is your seat, kiddo, you need to sit on that side of the desk.   And I became quite fine and in control, able to override my own anxiety and emotions enough to reach out to the people who came through the door looking for my help.  And then, I went home and hugged my family. That is all I can do, and what I will continue to do.\"\"A very large sophisticated terrorist operation, probably funded by Osama bin Laden and supported by others.\"To create fear and unrest and destroy the heart and soul of a freedom-loving culture\"I am more in the moment, reaching out and connecting more, and trying to strengthen the fabric of love and connection of which I am a part.\"\"I believe that Bin Lauden plays with semantics. I suspect  that his brand of anger and hate is stamped all over this  event.  I suspect he raised the monies and told his men the target is the United States. Do what needs to be done.  Make them hurt and bleed but do not tell me what you actually plan.  He feels his concsience is clear that he had no direct knowledge or planning in this attack, but none the less the hate he instills in others and men similar to him are the route cause of this evil.  I do not know how we combat such deep seated hatred of other Human beings.\"\"I am shocked, horrified and still disbelieving my eyes. How could any member of the human race do this? I am deeply concerned and worried about our goverment and in  particular our response to this as human beings. Revenge is mine saith the Lord!  How dare we think that our so called  idea of justice can be thought of as anything other than revenge.  On the other hand if out military is indeed capable of a major covert operation that will route out the base of these problems without major civilian casualties it must be done. Then does it make us a less free and open society not to know what has been done in the name of these United States.  My family has been involved in so many ways from the 1st  cousin who stood outside a buildin in Lower Manhattan and watched and ran,  to sister stranded in route home from Europe to Manhattan, to nephews who are active members of the military, and finally to the teens at home who are worried their friends and loved ones will be drafted.   Another words I am conflicted: hurt, scared, saddened and deeply worried. And yet like everyone else I am trying to keep working.  I only pause today for the High Holiday and then I watch the police outside my small city\'s congregation and think.. and what about Israel?\"I am concerned about being in large public places.   I am glad that my eldest is repeating her junior year of high school so that we do not have to fly cross country to look at colleges. And I am concerned  about hate crimes now being perpertrated against innocent  people.  From hate comes more hate and their goals  are being met in some indirect method.Belief systems so very different than our own.  The men are going directly to paradise and anyone who was innocently killed in their fight for good and  glory will go directly to paradise too if they believe in Allah.\"I bought some water, canned food and camping supplies in case the electricity goes out.  I watch the news more.  I hung a flag in my window because I was supportive of liberating the women of Afghanistan from the Taliban.  But we aren\'t liberating the millions of women in the surrounding countries that are facing genital mutilation.  I sympathize with the Palestinians and fly a flag.  My behavior is inconsistent, which bugs me.  My bumper sticker says  Enduring Freedom   I\'ve endured a lot of things in my life:  pain, misery, poverty, depression and limited freedom... now I guess I\'ll endure freedom.  Seemed poignant to me.   \"Wake up call!  Desperate destitute people have no hope of a future for their people.  Duh!  What have they got to lose?  \"I laid in bed for the first couple of days watching the war on TV and didn\'t even answer my phone.   I give massages for a living.  One of my clients is Pakistani.  He tried to make an appointment on 9/11, and kept trying for the next couple of days.  When he finally got through, I let him come over.  When I opened the door, he walked in and hugged me.  He cried, I cried, he cried, I cried... I asked him how he was doing.  He said it was pretty hostile out there.  I asked if he needed me to gas up his car or buy him some groceries.  He said he just needed a massage.   I\'ve been trying to understand what happened by reading the United Nations report on the Origins and Evolution of the Palestinian Problem.  Why on earth did  we  take land away from the Palestinians and set up a Jewish Nation when the Jews had been a diaspora for 2000 years?  It really pisses me off that I can\'t even ask that question without being afraid that people will call me anti-semitic.  What the Palestinians have been suffering for the past 50 years is a smidgen short of genocide and I can see why they are suidical.  I admire their courage.  I shall keep reading to try and understand how the US got the responsibility, when it was Britain that convinced the League of Nations to give Jews the Palestinian\'s land... And why we agreed to it. Of course it\'s all about money.  But there were anti-zionist Jews, and many chose not to go there.  There was something really creepy (to me) about the Zionist Jews.  They scare me like perverted hell fire and brimstone Baptist Preachers, pedophlia Priests and Fundamental Moslems. And that\'s the root of the problem.     \"Wouldn\'t surprise me if GW set it up to be perfectly honest.  I also accept that terrorists did it. And believe the current events are the result of fundamentalist hawk thinking on all sides.

'i think the terrorists are responsiblei read the paper and watch the news alot more.. i worry about my family and friends more also.. but i dont think my outward behavior has changed dramatically..because they hate what we as a country stand for.. the do not agree with our ways and believe it is their place to judge us.. the have extreme ways of inforcing what they believe..\"I think what happened on september 11th was really sad.. it was especially hard for me because I am first generation american and alot of my family still leaves in egypt.. which is one of many of the terrorist countries in the middle east.. i watched the tv nonstop, trying to make sense of what happened.. being away from my parents, being here at school was also difficult because my social network is not as strong in grad school, being my first year.. i heard a quote that best described what happened on that day that really sticks in my mind..  sept 11th was the day that hate taught americans how to love   i think it is a very strong statement and the way people have banded together amazes me and gives me hope in the humanity of people.. \"They are wrongly predjudice.0004I used to think that most of our population belong to two kinds in terms of urban behavior: the  hard men  and the others .a great deal of responsability comes from  hard men .mostly my world conception have changed a lot.for increasing capitals or his belief systems or boths.\"I feel that the USA has been so arrogant and ignorant internationally, that eventually this would happen.  Our plan to keep Sadam alive so that he would continue to stir up the middle east and make them so focused on each other and not us has failed.  This country is so big and out of control, I simply have no answers where we should start.  I fear that the USA is no longer the strong role model to the world...I grieve our loss as an American and fear the future.\"Because of the hate from personal loss they have experience due to acts of America or our policies.\"I canceled my Europe trip over Thanksgiving.  I did not go to DC the weekend after the event as planned.  Why?  Not really fear, but just loss of spirit and pain for the grieving families, international people here who love America but feel more foreign than ever, for Muslems and Islamics who are being abused for no reason, etc.\"Many individual groups with a common hate for my country.\"It seems surreal. I hear about the first plane while I was driving to a friend\'s house. I thought that maybe it was an accident. Then, less than three minutes later, I heard about the second plane. I was sure that was no accident! I watched the events unfold from my friend\'s house in Alexandria, Virginia. We heard the impact of the Pentagon attack and the Pentagon collapse at her house. We thought someone was knocking on their door. I held back tears until I watched, live, Tower 2 collapse. That was too much to see it as it happened. The group of people I was with stopped watching TV after that to pray. That really helped me keep my focus on my knowledge and understanding that God is still in control and man has proven that he is not in control. I am overwhelmed by the extent of the tragedy - number of people who have died; how many businesses/departments are completely wiped out; how our economy will be/is being affected by the concerned for travel; how many insurance companies are going to go bankrupt and be unable to pay insurance claimes? I also feel sad for the families of those who fought the terrorists on the plane that crashed in PA. It seems that their heroic efforts are often forgetten in that most references are made to NYC and DC, but not PA (including your paragraph above). I have moved on with my life, but I know that is easier for me because I am not directly, personally touched by this tragedy. I know second and third hand of losses, but nothing in my circle of family/friends.\"because there is evil in this world.\"I have more conversations about spiritual issues with students on the campus where I work, but other than that I don\'t think my behaviors have changed.\"\"I do not know, and am not convinced by the news reports.\"I am more skeptical that the world will ever find true--non-military imposed peace.\"At first I felt shocked and numb. Then I started feeling sad that there are people in this world that could do something like that. I also felt sad that people think violence is a solution to their problems, or the world\'s problems. I have watched the events in the Middle East, in Serbia and elsewhere with the same type of sadness. I am afraid that the more we wield violence, whether domestically in relationships, or in promoting political philosophies, the more violence will be using violence to resolve conflict. I am resigned to the reality that our country will engage in some violence to seek a solution to a violent act. Perhaps it is a necessary evil, like when Hitler had to be confronted. I suppose that in the end, people like animals are territorial in nature---why then do we supposedly have a superior brain. Why are we able to invent and find solutions. I daresay that the world spends more time and resources preparing for war, then preparing for peace. What types of resources do we have alloted to finding peace? How much to military might? I don\'t know. All I know is that I feel equally sad when we are bombed, as when we do the bombing--in both cases, it is terrifying to those on the receiving end. We are lucky to have resources and help those families whose loved ones were killed and hurt---those we go into conflict with don\'t always have the resources to care of the wounded and the dead, and the families that are left to cope. My role as I see it is to pray real hard for the Great Creator to guide us so that in the end, we are a much better nation and people---who feel for ourselves and for others too. Personally, this has made me reflect more about how I feel about a great many things. I do not feel vengence in my heart, though I do hope the people responsible for this will be caught and submitted to the full force of the legal system. I also understand that some folks will want blood...it\'s hard to blame them.  I feel uncomfortable because I grew up with Vietnam...and I have a 23 year old son. So yes. I have been unable to sleep about what this means to him and us as a family. But like I said, I am resigned that we will resort to violence to resolve violence. Overall,I am sad for the human race.\"Because they are angry and brain-washed to believe their cause is right and supported by a higher being.\"I don\'t know. Maybe the Osama groups as noted by the media. But I don\'t think we will never know for sure, unless some of the perpetrators are caught.\"\"My thoughts are that people abused early in life always have had their eyes open in  regard to ever present dangers locally and worldwide and that the entire world now has so to speak  lost the same innocence  that children do when they are abused. It is something that can never be regained ... a sense of distrust and only continues  to grow, in time, as new generations are spawned it will subside with their new  births and new innocence.\"government for flaunting their authority and power the people for being asleep and leting the government have so much control each of us individually for not caring enough about one anotherits always wise to be aware of ones surroundings...greedpossibly LadenI was truly shocked and thought this is something that will have a big impact for the entire political-social worldRead the papers more\"to get/exercise power, &/or for ideological fanatism\"They\'re NUTSWe are - we let our guard down.I am more suspicious of foreigners.\"I think it is a totally tragic event.

'I don\'t know.\"I was shocked when I heard the news. I was in a training class and did not have access to a radio or television at the time. I had called in for messages and was informed by one of my supervisors about the tragedy. I initially very shaken up and suddenly all of the nonsense that goes on at work seemed very petty. I was also  guilty  for having brought children into this world. I never wanted them to have to be afraid like this. The acts are deplorable and I just don\'t understand the complete disregard for human life. I believe these people probably felt that their God would see them as heros for dying and taking many of the infidels with them, but all I can feel is the absolute terror those passengers must have been going through. What were the babies on the plane feeling? How do you keep your child safe when a mad man if killing people in front of you? How does it feel to know that you are going to die because some who has no idea who you are wants you to die over an ideology? All these questions would run through my head over the past severa days and I still have no answers. I know that I hold my children a lot tighter and try to help them feel safe and secure. The only thing they may ever be able to hold on tightly to is the fact that I love them unconditionally. I cry very easily these days and probably will for a while longer. I thake these traumatic events hard in the beginning. I have stopped listening to the news because I need a break from the devastation. i don\'t know how the rescue workers can take being there for any length of time. I don\'t know if I could handle it. I remember thinking that I wanted to get a sweatshirt with FDNY on it, to show support for the people who lost their lives trying to help others. The human spirit is a strong one, thank God for that.\"I hold my kids tighter and I remeber to not  sweat the small stuff .Religious extremists - a small fraction of a religion gropbin Ladan and others associated with him\"My thoughts and feelings have been all over the place.  On the 11th I really didn\'t \'feel\' anything.  I could only relate to it like it was a movie, even though I knew it was real and wanted to feel.  That evening when the news started putting faces to it all the feelings came.  I felt a deep sadness for the families who had lost or had missing family and friends.  I felt sick for what those in the planes went through prior to their deaths.  All the things that had previously been concerns certainly pailed in comparison.  I hoped and prayed that many would be found alive in all the rubble, but as the days have gone on, that hope is diminishing.  I am a Christian with a strong faith and trust in God\'s soveriegnty and man\'s free will. I have never thought God was responsible or blamed Him. There will always be evil people.  I\'ve thought about what these people\'s lives have been like to cause them to do such horrific things.  I have been concerned, but not fearful about what could happen next.  I have been very proud of our President and his response.  I have been concerned about what kind of a world my grandchildren will be growing up in.  I\'m saddened at the thought that so many more may die because of the actions of a few.  I am encouraged at the response of the nation in turning to God.  I hope that it won\'t be just another wake up call where we roll back over and hit the snooze until another tragedy, as we did with the Gulf war and Olkahoma City bombing, but that we will be changed.  I was so pleased at the response of the our politicians, and even the news media as they encouraged prayer rather than acting like it is taboo to talk about.  I still feel uneasy and concerned about the future.  And I am greatly saddened for the families who have been affected and for those who anticipate having their families called into active service in the military.  \"Continually more aware of the shortness and uncertainty of life.  Evil and misguided.  They must be brainwashed.\"Hatred, anger, despair, trauma.  From what I\'ve read, many of the young men who get involved in these kinds of attacks have lived in war-like situations for much of their lives.  They have had family and friends die. The trauma in their own lives may make them susceptible to those who seek to wreak havoc (for money, for power,  for control?).\"I don\'t think my behaviors have changed (other than getting to the airport earlier than I would have otherwise).\"I was waiting to board a plane from San Francisco to Washington, DC when the attacks occurred.  When flights were first delayed, we hadn\'t yet  heard about what had happened.  We soon learned of the WTC attacks, then the Pentagon attack, and finally the crash in PA.  Shortly after the PA  crash, San Francisco airport was evacuated. I spent the next two days in a hotel room, riveted to the TV (and I\'m  not generally a TV watcher).   From the first day, my biggest concern was about the aftermath, both on civil liberties in the US and with regard to our military response. I believe that the war language being used is terribly dangerous.   Innocent civilians are killed and injured in far greater numbers in a war than in the recent terrorist attacks.  Hatred and violence only breed  more of the same.  Bombing Afghanistan is a good way to insure that  the US will continue to be a target of terrorist attacks.  Have we not learned anything from watching Israel in the past year?  I fear not. Increasing airport security was certainly a reasonable response.  Finding bin Laden and bringing him to trial would also be a reasonable response. War will only increase the hatred those fanatics feel for western culture and the US in particular. The events certainly increased a vague sense of vulnerability (but nearly so much as being robbed at knifepoint did!).  I am sure that those who survived the attacks at the WTC and Pentagon and those who had  close relatives killed have a much more heightened sense of vulnerability. Now, nearly a week later, I feel very sad--seeing the pictures of  the missing lining walls in NYC brings on tears.  It is heart wrenching. I think we would do well as a nation to look to our past and present foreign policies to try to understand our part in exacerbating the hatred that these extremists feel for us.  We should not condone the attacks, but should try to understand the experiences and beliefs that bring people to the point of sacrificing themselves in suicide attacks.  We are a country of great wealth that shares little with the rest of the world. How can we ask why young people bring guns to school to shoot those who have tormented and bullied them when the first response from government officials to these terrorist bullies is to threaten violence against them?   \"\"It appears from what has been reported that those who hijacked the planes were associated with Osama bin Laden.  While I in no way condone what they did  (nor can I really understand it), I think our foreign policy over the past 50 years has had some part in  the way others feel about the US.\"0It\'s the people that have planned for years for this.  These are the individuals who cleverly hijacked four planes and killed thousands of people with there radical movement.\"I don\'t take anything for granted anymore. I always thought the United States was invincible, I don\'t believe that anymore.\"I ask myself that question everyday.  We will never know the truth.  It\'s something that we will have to take with us to our graves.  Just believe that those innocent people didn\'t die in vain.Osama Bin Laden and those who follow him.  WE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE THE SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANSThey are bread to hate.  Evil exists in this world and it is so much easier than doing good.I pray more.  I refuse to indulge in pity parties for mself over trivial probblems in my life.\" It was meant to be the first introduction to our darkest days.  The planes flying into the Pentagon and WTC.  We were supposed to go into a foxhole of fear and change the essence of what it meant to be an American.  The terrorists meant to bring us to our knees.  Our selfish, secular and self-absorbed country would not be able to handle this strike.  It was meant to be the beginning of the end of America.  So they thought.  Yes, I watched in horror as the twin towers that I took for granted during my childhood in NJ crumbled.  Yes, I mourned deeply for the innocent people who lost their lives.  I cried for the children who lost a parent, those who lost a friend, relative or spouse.  Within hours I knew that America was changed forever. What the terrorists did not know was that as Maya Angelou pronounced, We Still Rise.  What they meant to be our darkest day hurled us into our finest weeks.  I was always thankful for firefighters and the police.  I now revere them.  I was amazed at the rejuvenation of NYC thanks to Guliani when I visited June 2001.  I am now in awe of the man.  In Oakland, CA, his leadership helped get me through 9-11.  My despair at how superficial our society has become was replaced by the knowledge that we are still a loving and compassionate people.  The stories of people carrying others on their backs down the stairs, moving aside so the severely burned could pass and forming a human chain to emerge from darkness to the light reaffirmed what I knew about the American spirit. The money that poured into to the relief funds makes me proud.  I have always been proud and thankful to be an American.  Now I sing the Star Spangled Banner and/or God Bless America daily.  I now emotionally digest every word.  With the anger and violence towards innocent Arabs and Indians, I understand how important it is for good to stand against evil even though we are bruised.    I have grieved like I never grieved before. I cried every day but something would not let me let it all out.  It took a week for me to fall to me knees and sob for those affected and the meaning of the events for our country. I finally let it all out.  Then I began to heal.  I am so proud of America.  The spirit of a oneness that has emerged.  I smile every time I see a flag.  I still cry regularly but some are tears of joy for the spirit of human kindness.  The understanding of what it means to be FREE is now not taken for granted.  I know people are really examining their lives and thinking about freedom and responsibility to society.  I wish this horrible event had never happened but I do not want to go back to America on Sept 10.  I want us to cherish this new awareness of the important things in life.  Love, liberty, family, friends,  human kindness, standing in the path of evil, sacrifice for the greater good.  I am a democrat and I think President Bush is doing a good job.  Heroes are not born, they are made.  I support him and am impressed.  I am still scared; sometimes depressed yet I am enjoying life.  I pray for the innocents in Afghanistan, but am confident that eliminating the Taleban is for the greater good.  I pray for America especially those in the military.  I know we still rise.

At first I kept thinking how like a really bad movie it was, only the perpetrators had more imagination, and more cold-bloodedness. In spite of how I think the USA\'s policies may have stoked the flames of hate, I think something must be done to mess up these peoples abilities to continue terrorism.

The organizers appear to have generated a way of thinking that disregards all established authority and undermines the very core of modernity; precisely the goal of a jihad.   About the possible perpetrators: Bin Laden is just the figurehead for a larger, more covert, organization composed of nations and groups who want to undermine modernity or who are hostile toward the United States.  About our response: A diplomatic solution that forces Bin Laden out of Afghanistan is the best choice. Military engagement may mean we will find ourselves involved with a coalition of other enemies such as Iraq.  About my own feelings: I am grieving intensely and feel sad. However, I dont feel less safe. The fact is, I have never felt safe because of traumas experienced earlier in my life. I will admit to feeling somewhat disgusted by the comments of some individuals who have said that their sense of security in American will never be the same. Frankly, there are thousands of Americans who live under terrorist conditions every day. For example, consider inner city youth who live with gang violence, drug wars, and poverty. And let\'s not forget the many, many, women and children who endure domestic violence and rape. The difference between the wtc and these more historical social problems is that the wtc victims have not been blamed for their own  deaths, while inner-city youths, women, and children, have all been dismissed as causing their own problems. Hence, many of us believe that it is acceptable to turn deaf ears and blind eyes to the pain. Perhaps the wtc trajedy will make us more compassionate to anyone in pain.   \"A coalition of islamic and other middle-eastern groups.

Every night when I went to bed prior to the 11th I wondered if there would be a world the next morning.  And every morning when I turned on the TV I flippantly thought I\'d better turn on the TV to see if there\'s still a world out there.   I\'m still wondering as I turn on the TV if there\'s still a world out there but it\'s not a flippant thought anymore.  I\'m terrified and I believe that we are in for more of the same. The thing I dislike the most about what happened personally to me is that I no longer trust.  I don\'t trust TV - what are they breaking to us gently.  How are we being manipulated?  Why all the double messages?   I want to go back to bed and cover my head and wish the nightmare would be gone when I wake up.  But I know there\'s nothing or no one who can pat me on the head and tell me it will all be OK. It won\'t be. If you want peace don\'t go to war. Sandra Zenger\"I pray more.  I cry more.

'\"For lack of a better word, evil.\"I now make sure I tell everyone I love exactly how I feel each time I leave them. I notice when airplanes go over and pray that this will never happen again.I think Osama Bin LadenPersonally I was not directly effected by the tragic events that occurred on September 11th.  Nonetheless the events have had an enormous impact on my life and my mind.  When I heard of the attack all I could think of were the thousands of families that lost loved ones.  I kept thinking that so many children no longer had a mommy or a daddy.  I don\'t feel as if the government should bomb or attack ALL of Afganhastan.  I am not saying to sit back and ignore this horrendous event but to take the time to find the person or persons responsible and take care of them directly.  Bombing an entire nation will just kill innocent civilians.  It is true that they did that to us but 2 wrongs don\'t make a right.  Why should we make thousands of their families go through what we are going through?  Don\'t make more children lose their mommy\'s and daddy\'s.

I feel like I am living in 2 worlds - a superficial world of normalcy and then this other - war?? This has also made the world seem so much smaller, and brings others\' suffering closer to home.   How can we get through this in a humane fashion?  With each passing day I feel more comfortable - maybe we are not going to jump in there and bomb them to pieces.\"More introspective.  More appreciative of my family and friends.  Religious fanaticism.  They think they are doing God\'s will and will be rewarded. EvilTerrorists\"When e-mailing others, I started out by saying that I was \'numb\'.  I was glued to the TV at home and radio at work for days; tried to get away from it, but just couldn\'t.  I was sad, I felt everything was completely out of my control, especially any time frame of any kind of resolution and the uncertainty of everything depressed me.  I was very emotional and close to tears a lot.  Finally Friday I let myself have a good cry; that helped.  I got very little done at work and spent the majority of the time talking with many about the tragedy, the horror, the senselessness of the events.  I now have a cold ... something I seldom get ... I imagine the stress compromised my immune system.  My hobbies held no interest for me; they seemed awfully insignificant; actually most things seemed that way.  By yesterday (17th) I wanted to start getting back to some normalcy; I was glad some regular programming was coming back to TV and was irritated when  special reports  kept breaking in.  All this is still very much on my mind, but I don\'t feel quite so consummed by it.  I am certainly concerned, but feel hopeful about the future.\"I\'ve been a bit more \'jumpy\' and felt a bit more vulnerable.  I feel a great deal more patriotism.\"To me, the events on September 11th seem completely unreal. I find it very hard to truly understand the magnitude of what has happened as I have not really been directly affected by this incident. In the days following the attack, however, I have carried with me an overwhelming sense of guilt for continuing on with my life and living as if nothing was wrong. I have felt the need or want to do something, but have had no idea what I could do. And now, one week later, I find hearing all the personal stories are making the whole incident seem much more real and are now really touching my emotions. \"terrorists in Afganistanbecause they were very angry0fanaticismbin laden\"The day it first happened, i let myself feel the pain, imagine the deaths, what it would have been like to be on one of the planes, to be trapped in the rubble, to have survived after fleeing down the stairs. I cried privately and with my close friend. I was angry because it was senseless and because I feared that it would being about war. I felt very frazzled at first; i kept remembering suddenly that the world was different all of a sudden because it was united in thinking and mourning about this tragedy. After several days, it became easy to not think about it because I didn\'t know anybody directly affected and I don\'t have cable t.v. in my dorm yet. I felt that it was over, unchangeable. And my thoughts were directed towards the repurcussions. I am bothered that the US govt is being so forceful, because underlying the  this will not stand...we\'re gonna hunt down those folks  mentality is the assumption that an American life is worth more than the life of someone from another country, and especially more than the life of someone from a  thrid world  country. We\'ve killed that many (and we kill many more indirectly with our economic and foreign policies). THe difference is only ideological. (You could say that the ideology that propelled us into vietnam and kept us there is as insane as Bin Laden\'s religion). I am not a political radical; i\'m actually apolitical in practice. I\'m not an activist, I\'m a thinker if anything. And I love America\'s ideals. I\'m just very skeptical about any excessive patriotism. Like I said, the difference is purely ideological; anything fanatical (even excessive patriotism in response to the terrorist act of a fanatic) is potentially explosive, somewhat dangerous, and ultimately self-deceptive, I think. Just look at the nonsensical, violent hate crimes that have already been committed against people who look Arab. I can\'t help feeling that a lot of the students i know around campus who are having the biggest reaction to this even though they don\'t know anybody who was hurt or killed are the same ones who were unstable before. Naturally, they\'ve been taking advantage of the cathartic opportunities for public grieving. I don\'t blame them for doing this unconsciously; I hope it can help them. But I can\'t make myself interpret America\'s grieving naively. It is genuine, but it\'s not only what it appears to be on the surface. I myself have moved on, because dwelling on the tragedy any more would not be helpful to me. I\'ve released all of the grief I needed to.\"\"i cried publicly on the day of the attacks, but since then my behaviour has been normal, except that i talk about this occasionally with people\"Terrorist.  It is too early to know. \"It has been a little over a month now and the events of Sept. 11 still break my heart. I will always remember where I was the day that it happened.  My husband and I were preparing to leave for our honeymoon.  Needless to say our flight was cancelled and I just remember being stunned that the most joyous time in my life could be intermingled with so much confusion and pain.  And, yet, my family and I had not directly lost anyone to these horrific terrorist attacks.  It was my empathy for those this happened, to the families and the victims, mixed with my own realization that the flight # we were scheduled to take on Sept 14 was the very flight # that was hijacked and crashed into the Pentegon.  That personalization was hard to come to grips with, here my husband and I were taking a trip to celebrate our new life together and this life we valued so deeply could so wastefully be taken away breaking the hearts of our friends and family who celebrated our marriage with us.  And, yet this is what happened to all of those people who went to work that morning or got a plane.  Fathers lost the joy of watching their children grow up, women lost the chance to have a child and children on airplanes lost the chance to become wonderful, loving human-beings.  Had empty planes hit the World Trade Center or the a part of the Pentegon I would feel vulnerable and angry about the loss of these symbols, but the human stories all 5,000 to 6,000 of them that is what makes this a tragedy.  That is what breaks my heart and that is what makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry and that is what makes me want make the best I can out of my life. \"I can not understand these events because I don\'t understand the actions behind terroism.

I was in class while it happened but as soon as I got back to my dorm, everyone was talking about it and it was all over the news. I just couldn\'t believe what happened and I couldn\'t even start to imagine the pain that people were going through who had loved ones killed or even in the area of the attacks. I thought the media really did a good job covering it, however, I felt that they should not continue to replay the airplanes crashing into the buildings. I feel that is a sight that we do not need to see over and over and over again.

Fundamentalist religious groups who advocate violence against Western countries, US foreign policy, poverty may all be indirect causes.\"Probably because they believe so strongly that it is the only way to act in accordance with their beliefs.  The group that they associate with probably makes this seem like valuable and appropriate behavior\"I\'m currently thinking more about the U.S.\'s reponse to the attacks.  Initially, I was shocked and overwhelmed by what had happened in NYC and DC...the images were upsetting no matter how many times I\'d seen them.  Now that a couple of weeks have gone by, I am less in shock.  Every once in awhile, the great tragedy of it all strikes me.  Mostly, I worry that the US government will escalate the situation and proceed without consideration of international law as an option to dealing with this.  Also, now that our country is in the phase of making policy decisions, rather than just dealing with the immediate emergency response, there is the possibility of misunderstanding and anger with co-workers and friends.  People feel strongly about what the US should do and because the crime was such an atrocity, people are more likely to shut down free and open discussion.  Worst of all, US citizens have committed hate crimes (sometimes against people who actually belonged to ethnic groups other than the one meant to be targeted).  This makes the situation all the more tragic because of the impact that it has on citizens who may now feel marginalized and/or unsafe.  It is really sad to see such ignorance during a time when you would hope people could come together and reduce hatred.\"\"I monitor how much I\'m watching the news.  I try to be calm when discussing these issues with friends, sometimes even avoiding the topic.  I\'m probably also doing irrational things like locking my office door and trying to take more security precautions that are actually unrelated to international problems.  \"I\'m in shock and am wondering what is going to happen now with America ready to go to war.

I was very saddenned by the sights...so many words...tragic, surreal,devastating, destruction, suffering... I am from New York STate and have spent quite some time in the city...it was painful to see the loss.    I also thought of the regret and sorrow the loved ones will feel as they recount the Tuesday morning spent with their loved ones in the daily obligations of getting ready for work..etc.  So many prayers and wishes for a re-do of that morning I\'m sure!     I am quite worried and sad about the Middle Eastern AMericans who are being treated with such hate although they are Americans as well.  It just adds to the pain and tragedy.     In many ways, it effected my days because it felt trivial taking place in my daily activities knowing my fellow Americans were buried under rubble and aching for their loved ones. \"desperate people in a foreign country where who don\'t really understand American life and whose lives Americans really don\'t understand. I read the newspaper more and am more likely to watch the news on TV.  I notice all of the American flags hanging out and do get a little inspired at the show of national unity.  I have more political discussions with my friends.  a night about a week ago I was in bed reading and suddenly I heard a plane flying overhead and it got louder and louder and sounded closer and closer and I freaked out and tried to run to my friends room right next to mine and ended up going to a nearby computer lab for company because I had a real sense that it might be a plane headed for us.  I actually thought about climbing under my desk for a moment....like bomb drills I\'d heard of.  \"well.....bewildering is the best word that I could come up with for the events.  it was surreal and horrifying and a tragedy of proportions I\'ve never experienced in close proximity or thought that I might experience.  and I guess that all of that is pretty typical.  for me, probably the strangest part--and the part that  bewildering  most describes--is the sense that all of this is far more rational than I would expect.  it is tragic and horrifying and so incredibly painful for so many people.  but I still haven\'t cried yet.  I guess that it\'s some combination of distance and confusion and the degree to which it is surreal.  but it seems like such personal pain that on some level I guess that I don\'t want to usurp the position of mourning that people actually directly (as in individual loss) affected are feeling.  its almost too much to comprehend and since the physical reality of it isn\'t looking me in the face each day I really can\'t comprehend it.....\"all I can come up with is that it must be people who are so desperate and live in circumstances that are so painful and filled with loss that they are lashing back in a way that they have become somewhat desensitized to--or that to them seems like giving a land that has incredible security a sense of what it is like to live somewhere where there is very little sense of security.  which in no way excuses what they did at all.full of fearI asked myself the very same question. I can\'t seem to find any answer that would justify such a horrific act.\"more aware of my surroundings, taking less things for granted\"0\"I think the people who are responsible are likely to be  people who harbor a deep resentment towards the mainstream beliefs and values of this country. Rather than feeling remorse, I imagine they feel as though they\'ve done a great service for their own cause. I think that we have to understand that whoever could have done this operates from a completely different framework, and at the same acknowledge that we have biases that make it particulalry  difficult to understand how the perpetrators of these acts think. I doubt we can truly understand what motivates them.\"I have experienced heightened awareness and sensitivity to my surroundings.\"Initially my reaction was one of amazement and surprise. I don\'t think the full magnitude of the event was processed until several days later, and even now (a week later)I still wonder about the implications this event  will have on our country and the world. So many issues have been brought  out by this event. Some of the issues, and more importantly the way in which they are presented by the media, concern me. In particular, I\'m concerned about how it might polarize people and increase their fear of those who are ethnically, religiously, or racially different from them. I also fear that because there is such a high level of emotionality connected to this event, that people\'s reasoning may be influenced in  negative ways that will potentially influence their behavior.  Of course, the emotional aspect of this tragedy cannot be ignored. The  people who have most directly been effected definitely need support both for their loses and also to help cope with their fears. I think this  event has shifted the collective psyche of the country and it is difficult  to speculate as to what is going to occur as a result. I think, may be it is this uncertainity and lack of control that is contibuting to the anxiety that now seems to plague us. \"\"I think that there are other people throughout the world who have systems of beliefs, norms, and values that are unlike our own, and motivate them to think and feel in ways that we cannot fully understand. I think these people must feel that the U.S. government and it\'s citizens devalue what they believe, and therefore such acts are justifiable.\"\"To imprint constant fear in the population, to weaken the country from its bases, the population\"\"I am a Venezuelan Ph.D. student in political science at the university of missouri st. louis. I have lived unstable situations such as two attempts of military coups in Venezuela and one major civilian revolt against government. I have seen people die in those battles, however what strikes me the most is not necessariy the 6.000 people that died. Of course this is the most infortunate consequence of the attacks, but it was expected in an operation like this. what strikes me the most is the vulnerability of the US and the response of government to counteract this weakness. I felt unsafe during the attacks, but know I feel worst. Just the fear that this could happen again and in greater scale, just the fear that with little effort (compaired to what the US is doing in Afganistan), extremists can put in danger inocent people with viruses such as Anthrax. I see the commitment of the US to attack and fight the battle against terrorism, but I have seen little about the commitment to secure its citizens. Just more inspections at the airports will not do this. It took one man to bomb a whole building in Oklahoma, imagine this network of extremists willing to die. the threat is inminent and I feel that this whole situation is going to have a very bad ending for the US people. \"\"Al qaeda, as a response of US international politics in the last 62 years\"I see more TVCannot understand this myself. Assume these people have no respect for human life--including their own.\"I am profoundly sad. My first reaction was one of horror and disbelief and then I wanted to know that my own loved ones were safe. When I was able to reach my husband, I started to cry because I was so relieved to hear from him (he was flying at the time airplanes were ordered down), and also because I was thinking of the enormous loss people who lost their loved ones would experience. I was also angry  to think that our freedoms were being challenged. In the following days, the silence in the skies around O\'Hare was totally eerie.  I had never thought much about the planes in the sky other than to think of their beauty and gracefulness, but this halt to air travel made me think of the planes as symbols of our freedom to move around as we wish. Today I am trying to get focused on my work again and trying to get something accomplished--since I accomplished very little since Tues.\"\"I find myself with an insatiable interest in the events and the persons affected. Everyone of the victims has their story and everyone of them is loved by someone or by many who are terribly hurt by this loss, and it helps me appreciate the magnitude of the loss when I learn about individuals. I am also feeling much more patriotic and more outspoken about supporting our leaders.\"Terrorists backed by mid-East political and religious fanatics.\"I do not know anyone involved in the events of last Tues. but I have been very deeply affected by them. I can\'t concentrate, I am eating more and sleeping less, all the classic signs of depression. I have cried every day since the tragedy and I am having a hard time coping. The individuals stories are the hardest to deal with.\"\"I don\'t think I\'ll be flying anytime soon, even though logically I know it\'s safer than driving. I don\'t know that I\'ll consider going to any national monuments anytime soon.\"They are convinced the US is evil. I think because the western influence has threatened their control over their own people and they resent that.Saddam. I think he may have framd Bin Laudin so he wouldn\'t get our retribution. I am sure Bin Laudin had something to do with it but I think Saddam was the main figure.\"I definately feel more patriotic.  But, I\'m also wondering what the world would be like if we had not been so nieve to think that something like this would have never happened. \"\"American\'s in the sense that we weren\'t responsible  enough to check our security measures.  If we had,  we would have found the knives that the hijackers  used and we could have prevented them for getting on  the planes.  \"\"Well, as an American I\'d have to say that our lives are forever changed. We can no  longer go to an airport and wish our friends/relatives off with a hug or kiss because  the terrorists fixed that!   We can no longer take hardly anything metal with us in our carry-on because security might think that it\'s a weapon.  Those are things that have  changed in the airport.  America and American\'s have changed in so many ways.  One  good way that we\'ve changed is that we\'ve pulled together.  We\'re more apt to help each other now and more concerned about others.  We\'ve come to a common agreement that  American\'s aren\'t going to put up with any more terrorism Bull shit and we\'re standing behind our president and leaders.  If the terrorists want to mess with some of us, they are going to mess with all of us.  It\'s all for one and one for all!!!!!  \"\"Because that\'s what they were told to do.  They believe that killing American\'s will entitle them to go to heaven but in reality, they\'re going to hell!\"\"Although I placed a high regard for other humans of all religions, races, ethnecities,after Tuesday, I feel more patient and less accepting of others ignorant behavior.\"\"Even thought the Cold War is over, the way we live in the US is has drastically changed.  I spent 8 years active duty in the USMC in the early 80\'s and had an opportunity to leave the US on a couple of assignments.  I knew then, that Americans hadn\'t a clue why we need an Armed Forces and why we still needed Arms to protect our National Security.  I am deeply saddened that September 11, 2001 unfolded as it did, but we should have been taking gretaer and greater precautions against terrorism as we saw how are American Citizens were being treated abroad, not to mention in te 1993 WTC attack.  I too am saddened that the country I love immensley will never be the same; the tennants we are built on were demolished in one morning....I am not sure that the correct answer is retalitory strikes against a perceived enemy; but I must answer honestly that I don\'t know the correct answer.  I do know that we cannot sit by idley and wait to see what is next.  I do support my country and it\'s leaders and suspect that our leaders have access to inormation that I do not as an ordinary citizen.  I hope they use it wisely....\"\"I must admit my ignorance to the whole of the middle east.  I am too ignorant of their reasons for terrorism; all the news reports that I have have pointed the Finger at bin laden, a very rich Saudi who took refuge in Afganistan.  What I do not understand is the Taliban or it\'s purpose.  My only impression is that it is not at all good for humanity; especially towards women.\"Hate and ignorance.  Membreship in a cult that has been lead toward evil.\"Terrorist groups, with the main suspect being the talban and Bin Laden\"I really am not able to understand at all why someone would do this.  Because they feel that our nation has treated them badly or done wrong.  They have a different way of thinking than I do though because i can not even grasp the concept of being able to perform acts like these.\"My behaviors have not changed very much, except that i have a renewed patriotism for my country and i am fearful of what else may happen.\"\"I still can not even believe that the events of September 11 took place.  I honestly can not even begin to understand how someone could carry out acts such as those.   It is so terrifying to think that something like that could actually happen and that it may happen again.  There is no way to protect ourselves from people who are  willing to risk their lives just to kill other people.  I think that the way in which the acts were carried out is what bothers me the most.  Innocent people on planes were used to kill even more innocent people.  I can not even begin to imagine how the people in the planes or in the towers when they were hit felt.  I think the amount of  bravery and heroic acts done by these people is amazing.  I wish there was a simple way to make everything ok again and to make us feel safe from this happening again.   Unfortunetly, I do not think that is possible.  Now we are in the stages of taking action again the terrorists.  We are bombing them.  To me it does not make sense to kill  even more innocent people.  However, I do not have a better plan and I feel that something must be done.  I do not think we will ever be able to get rid of terorism, but  hopefully we will be able to control it somewhat and prevent acts as devastating as these from ever happening again.  These acts of terror brought our nation closer together than perhaps we have ever been.  This is the saddest, most tragic thing that I have ever witnessed and I know that I will never be able to forget it.  \"',4,-5,0,2,5,1.41,2.12,0,0,0,0.71,0,3.18,0,0,1.41,0,7.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.76,2.48,0,0.35,2.12,0.71,0,0,4.25,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0.71,0,23.68,0,1.41,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,31.09,1.41,0,2.83,0,0.71,0,1.41,0,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,8.12,7.41,0,0.35,0,0,2.83,0,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,1.41,0,0,0.35,Female
'\"I am of course very sad, extremely sad to be blunt.  I have cried several times just thinking about the horror that people in that building must have felt and the pain and grief of the families who\'ve lost people.  I am saddened further by the response of the nation to these attacks, saddened that it took something this horrible for people to start to love each other and our country.  I am extremely angry at people who\'ve used this tragedy to further their businesses and profit from it, i am angry that Americans are attacking and blaming fellow Americans who are Muslims.   I am also very skeptical about the role that the media has taken, I am skeptical of the reasoning that is being given for the attacks.  It is very hard for me to believe that there aren\'t hidden reasons or a secret agenda. I also am afraid of what this might turn into.  I am not happy to live in a world where we have not advanced enough as a society to understand the consequences of our actions.  The citizens of Afghanistan are already suffering, for us to attack them is absolutely unfathomable for me to imagine.  I also fear what the repurcussions of such an attack will bring upon our nation. I guess my biggest fear is that this will turn into another World War and that it will involve the use of Chemical, Biological and/or Nuclear Weapons.  It is a fear that has been drummed into me since childhood, I have believed that i would witness a major world war since the second grade and it is like my biggest fear and worse nightmare might come true. K\"\"My behavior has changed in a few different ways.  I have paid more attention to the media than I have before in order to gather more information and learn more about what has happened, what is going to happen and why.  The first week was very hard and I was in shock and afraid the day that it happened.  I also never really thought that this could kind of attack would ever happen to the US, so i feel less safe in downtown Chicago than I used to.  I also worry more about my family and loved ones and the possibility that they may be killed or hurt.\"\"I believe that it is possibly Bin Laden, but i\'m not sure if I believe that or the speculated reasons behind the attack.\"I believe that it is more about money and power than idealogy and religion.To eliminate people who do not believe the same as them.  I have attempted to be more patient and kinder with strangers as well as loved ones and co-workers.  I have also given more of my time and resources to charity groups.\"I am deeply saddened by the tragic events that took place on Sept. 11, 2001.  I feel so badly for so many people -- the people in the planes, in the buildings, the people who witnessed it all, and the families of all who were involved. I am sad that there are people in the world who are so confused that they can justify the sacrifice of human life for their cause. And I am sad by the actions of the people who have taken the law into their own hands, who are lead by fear and ignorance. I am concerned that people are acting similar to Pearl Harbor, where anyone who looked Asian was discriminated against.  The same seems to be taking place with anyone who looks remotely Arabic or Indian, Muslim or not, turban-wearing or not.  I feel badly for the middle easterners who are being picked on and whispered about, and especially those who have been asked to take different flights, due to passengers being frightened of their appearances. I am glad that stricter security measures are being put into place for passengers, but I also hope the same measures are being taken on the employee side.  I have several relatives who work for airlines, who have told me it is fairly simple to get a job as a baggage handler, and that seems to be a pretty easy way to get to a lot of inoccent people. I also hope that the airlines are providing pilots and airline attendants with new training to deal with the new kind of terrorist we are faced with.   What happened under the Nazi regime is unfathomable to me.  That the same type of thing could happen again is frightening and shocking.  While I am very peaceful by nature and do not advocate war, I realize that we have no other choice.  We have to think about the greater good, and take our losses where necessary. I do want to say that I am touched by the goodness in people as well, though.  From the 1.7 million people who donated blood the first day following the event, to the governments of countries around the world who have mourned for our countries\' losses, to the courage of the passengers on the Pittsburgh flight, who knew they were going to lose their lives, and who didn\'t want it to be in vain, to all of the selfless rescuers and firefighters who went in with the hope of saving lives, but who didn\'t have a chance. While there are so many sad stories, there are also stories of courage, conviction and integrity, that I think we can all be inspired by. \"\"Al Quida, Ben Ladin\'s Taliban terrorist groups\"just really scared  The events of september 11th have been in my thougts ever since that day.  it is something that i can not seem te get out of my head however hard i do try.  i am not so mush scared of what happened on that day but for what is to come in the future. i feel that it will get much worce before it starts to get better and that is why i can\'t get this out of my head.\"A great deal of people, more than likely Usama Bin Ladem\"They have a lot of hate in themThey have not changed.they were angry or upset with our country\"a group of terrorists, possibly bin laudin\"I feel that this event was very shocking to our entire nation. It brought a lot of people together and renewed their pride in our country and in each other. It is tradgic that so many lives were lost but at teh same time it is incredible to know that there are so many people willing to give as much as they can to help others out in a crisis. I also believe that this event opened a lot of the younger generation\'s eyes to what is actually going on in teh world. Many of us forget about the tradgedies that occur constantly in other countries because we feel so safe in the united states. It gave us a glimpse into what others\' lives are on a continuing basis.\"i think unfortunately it is human nature to find a religious belief and feel 100\% convinced in the depths of your very being that it is right.  what that says about the REALITY of any of those beliefs is a little scary and i won\'t think about it now.  but, different people embrace different things in this way.  some people embrace rigid, hateful, inflexible ideologies that bring more suffering to the world in the name of god.  they believe they are right.  who am i to say they are not right?  well, i can\'t be sure. however the philosophies i\'ve adopted in life, that make sense to me and i will continue to abide by (despite our ultimate inability to ever know anything for certain) are that tolerance is better for the world.  love and compassion and warmth and communication always make the world better, and rage and violence always make it worse.  that is what i believe.   so enough of the pacifist tack.  i think acts of violence and hatred spring from a deep anger and lack of feeling loved, in a person.  in my experience, which may or may not be applicable to a completely different culture, but in my experience when you feel loved and you open your heart, you get all warm and fluffy and flexible, and other people\'s behavior doesn\'t bother you so much and you\'re far less likely to be violent.  so i think, again just projecting, but i think these terrorists have very cold hearts.  maybe not toward their families, but in a very important larger sense.  i think we develop in stages, as far as opening our hearts.  one stage is toward our immediate families and lovers, and a much later stage is tolerance towards the world; openmindedness towards people who are completely different from us.  i think the nicest thing about the US is that to some extent, we have evolved in this larger sense.  hey, i just thought of all this right now!  i\'m pretty pleased with that. \"\"well.  a variety of things.  1), i am a federal worker and i work just several blocks from ground zero and so i am very afraid for my own personal safety.  that is number one.  i watched the crash etc. from just several blocks away and was one of the people hoofing it north as quickly as possible when the 1st building fell.  you should probably change the format of this space i am writing in so it actually makes lines. second, i am flabbergasted by how difficult it is for people to understand one another.  not to trivialize it, but i am thinking that the problems between the arabic fundamentalists and western civilization in general is in many ways (this does trivialize it, i can\'t help it) similar to the problems i\'ve had in intimate relationships, with communication.  and that is assuming that both parties are trying.  sometimes people are just so different, or not even SO different, but just different, and try as they may, they cannot, simply cannot come to a mutual understanding.  how could this be?   i am dating an egyptian muslim at present, as it happens.  i am a white caucasian.  we have had a lot of discussions about islam and etc.  i am very openminded (if i do say so myself) and i think i can see tremendous value in the ways of islam in general.  islam as it is set down on paper, that is, and as it is lived and interpreted by moderate, progressive muslims such as (many who) live in egypt today.  on the other hand, there is at its core a sort of inflexibility.  my partner, who is educated and progressive and has lived in this country all his life, still ultimately feels that his way is right, and he has just become very tolerant over the years of those of us who do not recognize the right answer, for whatever reason.  however, my knowledge of christianity (the way i was raised) and judaism (based on the same book, after all) suggests that neither of those monotheistic religions is any less inflexible.   how is it that people can be so convinced, at their deepest core, of the correctness and rightness of their beliefs?   not to go on and on about this.  perhaps this is not what you are looking for.  but one final word about it, my own beliefs move in a pagan, holistic, new-age spirituality direction.  i am so deeply convinced at MY core that what i feel is real, that i would die for it.  however, my beliefs don\'t include converting others or intolerance.  ???  does the human animal just need to believe somethign?  how did all this inflexibility and hatred evolve?  just unbelievable.  and how to get around it?  i have been attending pacifist lectures and meditations.  Thich Nhat Hahn came to speak here in NYC a week or so ago.  he is wonderful.  he talks about how he would talk to bin laden if he were there with him.  thich nhat hahn has influenced thousands of people and helped make the world a better place. but could he really do anything when it comes to bin laden?  he hasn\'t had the chance.  but could his love and forgiveness and tolerance affect Al-Quaeda?  or is it too late for them?  who is right?  maybe they are right?  the United States certainly is not blameless in any scenario.  our middle east policy is greatly flawed and has created tons of suffering and i can understand how it could very reasonable engender hatred.  who is right?  the liberal apologists take it upon themselves (the US) and blame the US and say their chickens are coming home to roost.  other more centrist and rightwing writers say that is a hideous perspective, that we need to have some self respect and say that our stance in the world is not as evil as all that.  i don\'t know. i think it is hard to have enough information to judge; you\'d have almost to be a state department employee, very high ranking, to know enough about what has really gone on over the decades to be a good judge of who is to blame in all this.  ultimately it is the nature of people to clash and not understand one another, at least at the level of evolution we are all at.  but i am tantalized by the forgiveness and pacifist approach:  could it ever realistically work?  it DOES work for the best in the life of the individual.  if i am here in my office and someone starts something stupid with me, there is no question that a reasonable, compassionate discussion is going to be hugely more fruitful than my responding with rage or violence.  no question.  it simply makes sense that what is true in the microcosm should be true in the macrocosm.  but is it?  then of course there is the realization that even if it is true, and that is the way to go, convincing the rest of my country about it is probably not going to happen.  but i am taking a pacifist stance anyway, at this time, because i am afraid of escalating violence and because if i am going to die, i want to be in the most highly evolved state i can manage.   don\'t know what else to say, although i could go on forever.  i am trying to sell my apt. because i am afraid to be in nyc any longer.  what to do once i sell it (assuming the real estate market even comes back) i don\'t know.\"\"well the city got much friendlier for a couple of weeks.  the arrogance and untouchability of much of our youthful, beautiful population here disintegrated briefly, and that was nice.  i think i have felt more bonded to those around me.  i feel as though i\'ve experienced something with other NYC people, that bonds me to them in an important way.  i dont\' feel as connnected to people who don\'t live here, because it\'s not real to them (except some people in DC).  i have spent a little more time, particularly in times of high anxiety, living for THE MOMENT, like NOW, because it feels good and i was afraid there would not be a next moment.  fear is quite helpful that way.  i have also been a little less anxious about problems in my own personal life.   one thing that has changed that makes me VERY happy is, i feel the US is part of the world now.  not that i am glad all these people died in the WTC, but i always berated myself for not keeping up on world events and seemingly not caring what was going on in the world around me.  i would force myself to read the paper sometimes but i couldnt\' retain any info because i did not CARE.  it did not seem real to me.  now, i care.  now, i see that i am part of the world and that the US is indeed vulnerable and that we need to consider those around us.  i am very grateful for this change in perspective.  i bet this is part of what the terrorists wanted... to humble us some.  if there is a good side to what has happened, this is part of it.  i have had my nose in the newspaper and intelligence magazines and etc., books on the middle east etc., since Sept. 11. \"\"probably you were looking for something else in the above block bc this is all i talked about.  i think it\'s very hard to say who is responsible.  i mean clearly the terrorists are in the most obvious way and also on a somewhat deeper level, because regardless of what the US has done in the past, a sudden act of huge violence like this is a very bad idea, and i think the terrorists are misguided.  however, beyond that it\'s very hard to say.  the US typically is the recipient of a huge amount of criticism from me regarding our unscrupulous and shortsighted consumerism.  i think with as much money as we have, we can afford to live better and more sustainably, and we should, and i talk about that all the time.  on the other hand, i think that criticizing the US and naysaying all the time can become a kneejerk response and can reflect the individual\'s outlook on the world as much as it does real situations.  i felt very good to read some non-apologist literature that stood up for the US.  after all, we do do a lot of good in the world as well as a lot of arrogant bad things.  so really i have no answer.  i wish we could all have a big worldwide group hug and learn more tolerance.\"I am more patriotic then I was before the attack.Ben LadinI am sad at what happenened and I hope it never happens again. But I am also mad at who ever did this and I think they should be punished some way. I do not know.\"I am currently a counselor in a college setting; I also worked for the Red Cross and took the call about the Hyatt Diaster (1980\'s in KCMO) and I spent the lst 22 yrs living in NY;my first reaction was anxiety about friends living and working in the area;eventually, when I stepped out of my counselor role, I got in touch with my own fears: shock, lack of control, anger about how could this happen in a country where we are supposed to have sophisticated training and resources; I have had difficulty sleeping through the night; my heart goes out to those who lost loved ones; I am so touched by the generosity of spirit and courage of the workers and  volunteers; I am concerned about the ongoing and longterm needs of the families and workers who will be dealing with delayed stress and I pray we offer   counseling for those in need. I continue to feel anxious and concern; my students work about how this crisis will effect them...will they be able to continue to afford school? will they go into the military? I wonder if my son will serve; his dad was in Vietnam; will I be writing letters to my son as I did to his dad? I hope we dont forget how important every day is as time heals the initial shock.\"000\"I was in New York when it happened, visiting friends, and at first found the whole tragedy unreal.  My first wish was to help, so I went to give blood.  Then we just walked the streets of the city, quietly, as did so many others.  I find the attack horrific, although I cannot help but admire the precision and planning of the attackers.  The images that came from the television seemed almost like a film, but I knew it wasn\'t.  I am so dreadfully sad for the innocents who died, and so angry at the terrorists for purposely aiming at innocent targets.  In some ways it would have been easier to accept had they attacked a military base, and had they not used civilians (the planes) to attack.  I still feel like weeping, and know that in some small way I have changed irrevocably.  I was also so proud to be in America during the first days after the tragedy.  To see how everyone rallied, to witness their pride and to share with them the experience.  The only blott on the landscape is that a few individuals cannot separate muslims/arabs from these terrorists and are now behaving in a manner similar to the attackers.  I feel for these people as well, and it is a bit reminiscent of the treatment of innocent Japanese during WW2.  Writing this down for the first time has helped me, and I wish you well with the study.\"\"I am more reflective, appreciative and also saddened.\"\"Men and women who are devoted to the Bin Laden, and I do believe he is the mastermind behind the attacks.\"America is a much hated country in many parts of the world because of her superiority - this attack proves for those who hate America that she too is vulnerableI am willing to entertain the notion that Osama bin  Laden is the financier of the operation.  It was obviously a long time in the planning and was brilliantly executed. \"I am grieving deeply for the lives that were lost and I have a renewed faith in my fellow Americans and their capacity for heroism and self-sacrifice. I believe that we must move to protect ourselves from further terrorism. At the same time, I do not think that a vague war on an unidentified  enemy is going to solve this problem and bring the perpetrators to  justice.  Such a war may have unintended and very negative consequences. I believe that the lives of innocent people in every country are as valuable as American lives.  I do not wish to see more suffering inflicted upon the people of Afghanistan although overthrow of the Taliban and the apprehension of bin Laden would be good things.  OUr foreign policy stinks and has stunk since the Monroe Doctrine.  I think it is time to recognize the Palestinian right to a homeland.  Settlements in Israel must be stopped.  Life in the USA will be different now. \"\"Someone would do this because they believe in the  riteousness of their cause, they believe that American society is evil, they believe that they will be martyrs for their faith and are willing to die for what they believe.

I do not live in New York or Washington D.C. and if I did, I\'m sure this would have affected me on a much more personal level. This has also affected my ability to feel that I can get on a plane safely.  I don\'t think I would ever want to fly anywhere.\"Our of hatred for our country and our religious freedom.\"Bin Laden of course, and I also feel that our government is partially responsible for not preventing these attacks and making sure that things like this don\'t happen to our country.\"I am more afraid to fly or to be in any major cities where another attack could happen.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,2.48,0,0,0,0,0,2.72,0,0,1.98,0,9.17,0,0,0,0,1.49,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.45,1.24,0,0.99,5.45,0,0,0.5,5.46,0.25,0,0,1.25,0,0,1.49,0,36.42,0,2.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.05,3.47,0,7.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,11.39,12.14,2.97,0.99,0,0,3.71,0.5,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,2.72,Female
'Because they have been socialized to hate the US\"It hasn\'t in the long run.  Initially, I had trouble getting work done, but I am doing better now.   I guess that I am more patriotic now than I normally am.\"\"I suppose that my reactions were fairly consistent with most people.  Initially, I was in denial that such a horrific event could even happen in the US.  After the realization sunk it, I was completely horrified and distrssed over the events of the day.  I found myself in tears over the next couple of days and I still often find it hard not to cry everytime I see the TV coverage of the events (especially when they have on victim\'s families).  I\'m coping better now (a week later) and find myself wanting retribution for what has happened.  I worry, however, that innocent people may be killed in any act of retribution (and that distresses me as well).  I am proud that our country is coping, that we are brave, that we\'ve come together.  I have never seen such displays of patriotism and expressions of empathy in my lifetime.\"\"Osama Bin Laden (sp??) and people that support his networks (the Taliban, Iraq)\"\"Nothing yet. Small things in the future, like not taking my Swiss Army knife when I\'m traveling by air.\"Because hate is easier than love.\"Horror. Shock. Pain. Grief. I watched the 2d plane hit and it never occurred to me that the buildings could come down. I watched in disbelief as they seemed to dissolve before my eyes. I had nightmares last night about the pain. Flying glass, thousands dying in a matter of minutes. I danced at the wedding of one of the young men killed. I am afraid of the future. War frightens me. There could be as yet unimagined changes in our daily lives. There is now a terrible uncertainty about the future that was not there a week ago. It\'s as if the very structure of my reality has shifted.  I am appalled at some of the responses, e.g. Falwell blaming this on gays and feminists. And I know that at a very deep level, this is an insoluble problem. Islam and the West have been at war for more than a thousand years. Some of the disputes, when two peoples claim the same land as in the Middle East cannot be solved. And it so much easier, and so much more emotionally satisfying to hate rather than to love. Love is hard, hate is easy.\"Humanity.\"It has certainly been a long and difficult week.  I feel like I am waiting for the other shoe to fall.  I wish I knew what our plans are (The USA, I mean).  I just cannot believe that we are  going to war .  I cannot imagine that history is taking this turn, that so much of what we have taken for granted is now something of grave concern.  Case in point--I am supposed to be flying in a few weeks to DC to give a talk and I am honestly petrified.  The idea of getting on a plane seems unthinkable to me, foolhardy and just plain  not worth it .   There is also this awful feeling like any word of caution--any mention that maybe we should not allow ourselves to be goaded into this conflict is somehow unpatriotic or anti-American.  During the first World War, Freud looked out his window and saw people dancing in the streets--celebrating that they were going to war.  And that is where he got the idea of thanatos, the death instinct.  He couldn\'t make sense of humans experiencing joy a the prospect of killing and, most probably, dying--he couldn\'t explain it with the other concepts he\'d relied on, all of which were based on the notion of preserving life.   The last few days, I have pondered this--not so much the concept of the death instinct but Freud\'s abject confusion in the face of the celebration of death.  So many more Americans will die.  It all seems so surreal.  Bill Clinton was interviewed and even he seemed ready for war.  He said something about how during his administration the people weren\'t ready but now they are and he hopes Bush takes advantage of it.   Revenge, retaliation, aren\'t these supposed to be bad ideas?  I think about a sign I saw at a protest here in Columbia last weekend (we weren\'t protesting, just driving past).  It said something like  The only way to be truly safe is to create a world where no one wants to harm you.   The woman at the counter at the post office today spoke in hushed tones about this very topic.  She looked around to be sure no one was looking or listening and then said  You know, it\'s sorta like when you are trying to teach a child not to bite.  Someone might say \'bite him back, to show him how much it hurts\'.  But then I think to myself, \'But who bit first? Are we the bitees or the biters?\'    I keep seeing headlines that say  Why us?  and I really blame the media and America\'s insatiable appetite for sleaze over real news for the fact that we have NO IDEA why this is happening.  It is easier for us to think of the  evil doers  as somehow qualitatively different from us than to think that there might be reasons behind their actions.  I don\'t think these actions are justifiable by any means, but I do think we lack a big part of the  back story .  If the media had been covering the Middle East with anything like the enthusiasm they showered on  Gary Condit\'s sex life, I don\'t think we\'d be asking  why us?   At least not with the same degree of shock.   Part of me is particularly bothered by the idea that the things that  America  might have done to provoke such hatred are probably things the government did that Americans--the people--know nothing about, and probably to our eternal regret, never cared to hear about either.   Even though this country is  a democracy, I think the typical American takes little responsiblity  for  what the government does:  So much bad news about so many angry people so far away that we don\'t understand.  What\'s on the other channel?  Most of the victims in the WTC tragedy probably didn\'t vote.   I know that bin Laden declared that all Americans are extensions of the United States of America.  It is interesting that this catastrophe has maybe for the first time provoked many Americans to recognize that he is right--but not in the way he meant.  I don\'t know that I have ever felt more like an American or more like a citizen of the USA, part owner of the  American Dream,  than now, following this disaster.  My obliviousness to the suffering of others in the world, some of which was paid for with my tax dollars (paid without serious consideration of the prospect of not paying), my naive  just going about my business -ness in a world set up for my convenience, and now my shock and outrage and sadness, all  make me a real American too.  There is something notable about how so many of the victims, so many Americans, were people who came from other nations fairly recently.  They had names I cannot pronounce and they have died for their desire tobe a part of  this Great Nation,   The Land of Opportunity.  True Americans.   What else?  Oh, the Dallas Morning News headline last sunday certainly helped me feel better about leaving there:   Christians Worldwide Mourn .  As if non-christians weren\'t mourning?  As if christians experienced a worse loss than anyone else?  If anything you would think we dreaded non-believers have more to mourn, since those christians have put their eggs in the heavenly basket of the afterlife and we heathens know that what was lost on September 11 is all that there is, is all that humans can hope for.   Jerry Falwell says on TV that gays, lesbians, feminists, the ACLU, etc. have  helped to make this happen .  At least he seems to have been roundly criticized for it.  I find myself also taking some comfort in the idea that we might be going to battle against the Taliban and fundamentalist Islam.  Do you know what these fellas have done to women in Afghanistan?  Imagine if Christian fundamentalists were suddenly in charge of women\'s rights in this country and  you have an idea.   As far as the heroism we\'ve seen in the last few days--nothing is more touching to me than those fire fighters and police who gave their lives at the WTC.  I am just in awe of that kind of courage.  I have been troubled some times with the constant harping on the  heroes  of the flight that went down in Pennsylvania.  We may never know what really happened on that flight.  And I do admire those passengers if they really did somehow prevent the hijackers. But the passengers on the other  planes don\'t really deserve the comparison.  I cannot imagine getting on a plane--thinking I am going to visit my family, or go to this conference or  I am going to work my crossword puzzle and eat this lousy food then spend some time with friend and having someone sitting next to me thinking  I am going to kill today and I am going to die today.   I think about the level of disbelief I felt when Lisa called and told me to turn on the radio or get on the web because a plane crashed into the WTC--how could anyone on those planes be blamed for experiencing an even greater sense of disbelief and shock. \"I left work early on the first day and the second day afterwards. I also  have been thinking of cancelling my plans to fly.Terrorists from the Middle East--I guess the groups associated with Osama bin Laden.\"These individuals equate the American people with the actions ofour  government.  They are angry about our constantly siding with Israel. But more than that, It hink they really just despise the Western way of life and wish to disrupt it.\"\"Because they have a cause that they feel very strongly about, and b/c they  feel that this activity will serve the cause.\"\"I stay up later watching the news, try to understand politics more than I ever have before, talk more with others about past and current events that might explain things, read more about bin Laden on the internet,  and I play out \'what if\' scenarios (not as worrisome thoughts, as preparatory mechanisms--e.g., do we have a will ready for our kids, should I die on my next flight? If bio war broke out, what would I make my role be?) Sort of an an innocculation, I guess, against anything in the future. The thoughts do not distress me, they comfort me,  by making me feel more prepared for anything that should happen in the future.\"\"The terrorists are immediately responsible, Bin Laden and/or some govt is likely more distally responsible, and the US is likely even more distally responsible (considering policies, activities)\"\"My first thought was to wonder if, while there was a big bombing on the east coast, there would also be a biological attack on the west coast. Perhaps some sort of disease that would take a couple of weeks to incubate...so while we exert our effort, grief, and attention to the east coast, a disease spreads from the west. I noticed the news said that such attacks were difficult and unlikely...but I still watch and wait for signs of sickness. It seems that the decline in our airway systems could prevent such disease from spreading too rapidly...but... Second, I was deeply alarmed and saddened. While I was sad about our losses, I did not experience real anger until we began to talk about retaliation. It especially angered me that people were trying to talk about retaliation as though it were self-defense. Going after Bin Laden does not seem to be a good way to  defend  ourselves, b/c it would probably just turn him into a saint, and his followers would then follow  him  as a saint and as a mythical spirit with all the more zeal. I do not believe in either terrorism or in  retribution . I see this as an opportunity to show that we are morally  bigger  or  better  than the terrorists. But this doesn\'t seem to be happening. We seem to be persecuting our own American Muslims (someone yesterday suggested to me that those in the US who  dress that way  (like the arabs) should  expect  abuse....this makes me very angry. I do not want to be associated with such thinking, and have been thinking of taking up Arab dress codes myself. Sigh. I guess I can forgive the terrorists for dying and killing for their  cause  because I do not see them as that different from Americans and American soldiers who would knowingly fight to the death  in an American endorsed war, for an American cause. But I find it enigmatic that then some Americans would suggest that the terrorists are  subhuman  when they die for their cause. I totally disagree with their methods (and I\'d probably also disagree with their cause, if I felt like I really understood what it was), but they are not so different than anyone else that dies for what they have judged as a good cause. I am familar with Pennebaker\'s work (I have a PHD in psych). I realize that some of my anger comes from the fact that other American attitudes seem to thwart my own attempts to make meaning out of this. The meaning I would make would not be to see this as an opportunity for retaliation, but as an opportunity to increase our defenses against terrorism in general (which we are doing, thank goodness), and to gain moral strength by rethinking our policies--policies that have offended other countries (and rightfully so). I love America\'s freedom. But it seems to me that we are a fat and selfish and wasteful nation as well.\"\"To polarize people on all sides, to start a war perhaps, to cause harm just for the sake of causing harm\"\"When it happened, and for the next few days, I was so angry -- I almost understood the people who were attacking or making derogatory remarks about Arab Americans, even though intellectually I was horrified.  All around me my liberal friends were rallying to talk about how horrible and racist the scapegoating of Muslims was, and how terrible it would be for the U.S. to get into a war.  And for several days all I could think was that if we did get into a war, I would be almost glad.  This is not normal for me at all, and I was scared to death by how angry I was.  I still am.  After talking to people and thinking about things for a few days I stopped feeling so bloodthirsty, but I still just can\'t stop thinking about it.  I keep finding myself imagining what it must have been like, in those airplanes or in the World Trade Center.  It doesn\'t do any good to think about it, and there\'s certainly nothing I can do about any of it, and it\'s not like any of it really affects me personally.  So I don\'t know why I\'m still so much on edge.\"I went to church for the first time in months.\"I don\'t think we know the details yet, but clearly some Middle-Eastern terrorist organization\"I avoid the subway when possible.

I was touched by the story of the woman called by her husband from the 3rd plane, as she listened when they tried to get the plane back from the terrorists, listened to the crash, and still holding the phone for half an hour, while hope vanishes, that they could have survive.

'\"I am scared to fly and have to fly in two weeks to a conference. I will not look for the cheapest ticket, but something that for one reason or the other feels more secure and will not fly out of Boston.\"\"Because of hate, reasons for which are VERY complex\"Osama bin Laden\"I vividly remember that day and the moment I heard what happened. We had a break in our seminar, a couple of us went to get a cup of coffee, when a colleague came and said what had happened. I do not remember her exact words. I can hear the word bombing, although I am not sure if she really used it, or the first thing that came to my mind was war, especially when I herd that the Pentagon was attacked, and war means bombing. The whole Department, all the faculty and grad students, was in the main office and we were listening to the news on the radio, still having problems comprehending what happened. I guess I will never understand how someone could have done this. My best friend is from NYC and he happened to be in the city that day, because he had to attend a funeral. He has a tendency of being at weird places looking for random coffee shops where to do work. Although I know there are no cute coffee shops in the WTC area, I was worried sick if he was OK. Of course, I could not get him on the phone, cell phones were dead and could not reach him at home either until that afternoon. Everything was fine luckily. The other thing that made this surreal event more real to me was the fact that I fly pretty frequently from Boston to LA, and two planes on this route crashed. It definetely does not happen to other people, it could have happened to anyone, me included. I was glued to the TV for the next two or three days. The pictures looked like war time Vukovar or Sarajevo. One more thing to make it more personal. I am from Croatia, and have fresh memories of the war. War memories do not fade. This was like a fleshback in the reaches of the dark side of human nature. I was shocked and I was scared. Even the word war is scary. Americans do not really know what is a war and calls to a war are that more alarming. Yes, something has to be done, but not going to Afganistan to kill all the people there. They are people too and doing that we would not show to be any better. I spend a whole class time in my intro class the day after the attack to process the event with my students. There was just one student who wanted to kill everyone in the Arab world (and I am not exagerating here!). The students were shocked, but thought about the consequences of possible US reactions. I am now whatching TV much less. It is hard to look at the pictures of NYC. I love the city, it is probably my favorite city in the world. A hurt city now. I wonder what is going to happen next. I do not consider the president to be a particularly intelligent individual, and that scares me even more. I do not believe he is able to handle it. I just hope there is someone in his environment who is able to both think and feel. I have read the results of a GAllup poll saying that more than a half of Americans support that Arab Americans wear special IDs. REminiscent of an episode in history about 50 years ago... The event itself is horrible enough, but there will be long term consequences larger even than the pile of debris in NYC. The discrimination has started already, and it is not even limited to the Arab Americans. A friend, a student from SIngapore was fired from her job a few days after the attacks, with the explanation that she is foreign. I am scared. If a war starts, nothing and no one will be secure any more. Today I heard about the vulnerability of nuclear plants...\"\"I am a US citizen, but I was in Stockholm, Sweden, when the attacks occurred.  I wonder whether that fact has influenced my subsequent reaction to events.  There were two sides to being away from my country, good and bad.  First, the people around me reacted differently than if I had been at home (California).  Even as the news was still breaking, and afterward as people tried to describe exactly what had happened, life, in Sweden and all of Europe, went on.  Life went on.  People shopped, ate out, drove their cars, took public transportation, etc.  Everyone was sad and concerned and very supportive, but they still went on with their daily lives.  When I returned home a few weeks later, I learned that the US had essentially stopped for a few days.  I think the reaction of a community has to color an individual\'s perceptions and later reactions, regardless of that individual\'s innate personality.  So seeing the whole country shut down in shock and fear has to affect you differently than watching events develop in a country that marks the event with sadness but doesn\'t completely stop.  So I think that part of being abroad was good for me.   The day after the attack, I joined an American friend in Estonia, who had been living in Russia for the past year.  That\'s when the bad part of being abroad started to emerge.  My friend was, I discovered, quite prone to anxiety, and I think that her isolation from other Americans made her anxiety worse.  She was completely obsessed with trying to find news and spouted conspiracy theories and bloodlust and constantly fretted about war and bombing and on and on.  It was irrational and uncomfortable.  I am still worried about her, now that I\'m back in the US and she\'s alone in Russia again.  When I left, she was obsessing over whether to cancel a vacation she had scheduled with her mom, because  maybe it\'s not right to take a trip at a time like this .  She even agonized over whether or not she should send some gifts for friends home with me, because again,  it seems wrong to be giving gifts right now .  I told her that she was being ridiculous and that we all have to go on with our lives.  It\'s not disrespectful to live normally.  You have to grieve, but you can\'t stop living.  That\'s part of healing.    So I guess that was the downside of being abroad.  My friend and I were alone in dealing with the attacks.  I think you can be helped along by having a community around you.  It might be easier to be caught in a spiral of fear if you\'re alone and without a bunch of different people\'s views and voices and reactions to experience that you can filter through and use to arrive at your own (but hopefully moderated) perception. I tended to take a much more detached, long-term, big-picture sort of approach (and my rather non-emotional reaction was probably stronger than usual because I was trying to set myself apart from my friend\'s extremely anxious mood).  yes, it was awful.  yes, i am grieving.  yes, I am angry.  But I also acknowledge that this and other world events are always more complex than the politicians or the media would have us believe, and I think my long-term view of things helps me keep it in perspective. I actually think that the world didn\'t really truly change on September 11.  Our perception of it did.  Humans have done horrible things to each other through all of history, and we\'ll do it again, but we keep going, somehow.  Europe didn\'t convulse in terror, partly because they were on another continent, obviously, but also because they have the collective memory of war.  They\'ve been through truly wretched stuff, including recent terrorism, and lived.  I think we (americans) just need a little toughening and unfortunately some huge and horrible like the terror attacks was our wake-up call.  Am I happy about this?  No.  Do I want ware or terrorism or uncertainty?  No, of course not.  But you have to live with what you\'ve got.  You don\'t have to like it, and you should work to make things better, but I think you have to be rational about your situation before you can be effective.  We can do it, it\'ll just take time to adjust to our new perception of the world.  And I think we\'ll eventually get a grip and move on.  It\'s just going to take time. I do think the US has made some unfortunate decisions that have contributed to the creation of anti-American terror groups.  We\'ve supported opposition groups in the past that have later become the new enemy.  And now in Afghanistan we\'re doing it all over again.  We\'ve taken an extremely pro-Israeli position in a conflict in which neither side is blameless.  It has always seemed silly to me, but apparently to some people it is worth killing over. I don\'t think that terrorism is a reasonable solution to any problem.  In fact I don\'t even think it\'s ever worked as a solution.  But I do think that people of all nationalities and religions turn to absurd extremes when they\'re unhappy or afraid.  It\'s a way of feeling in control.  And American policy has either directly contributed to or completely ignored situations in which large numbers of people are poor, resentful, unhappy, afraid, and feeling out of control and without hope.   I really, really, really hope that we allow food aid to reach the thousands of Afghan refugees before winter sets in.  I hope that after we finally stop bombing, that we work for peace and freedom and giving hope to people, instead of simply walking away from the wreckage, leaving them to nurse their injuries and fear into hatred.  How we can do that is beyond me - how do you replace fundamentalist theocracies with systems that give people hope without looking like meddlers who are destroying culture?  I hope we take a more balanced approach in the middle east, one that is more likely to lead to peace.  I don\'t think that doing this is  giving in  to terrorists\' demands.  I think it\'s finally implementing policies that actually work. Here at home, I hope that Americans will become more aware of world events and try to see how interconnected everything can be.  I\'m glad to see efforts toward building tolerance and maintaining civil liberties.  I think Americans are friendlier than they were before the attacks.  I am glad to see mental health care get a boost, even if it is catalyzed by such horrible events.  I hope that we can use this opportunity to make real progress in mental health care generally in this country.  I think there have been some very useful discussions and debates since the attacks.  I don\'t think americans really consider all sides of situations very often (in fact I often agree with the stereotype that Americans are ignorant and don\'t want to think), so this has been nice to see, although we\'re settling back down into our entrenched positions again.  That\'s unfortunate.  I\'m sad to see the edges of national anxiety.  Reports of doctors prescribing antibiotics and people stockpiling survival or warfare supplies are especially disappointing.  (I\'m a biologist and all too aware of how overuse and abuse of antibiotics has led to many of our current infectious disease problems).  I have never liked the simplistic, sensationalist bent of our media.  I think the media just might be contributing to national mental health problems.  If there were ever a time for rational, educational, analytical news, now would be it!  Most of all, I wish people would just calm down and think.  I am very curious to know what our history books will say about this in 50 years.  What were the right choices, what could we have done better?  What will be better and worse about our world after all of this has come to some sort of equilibrium (or stalemate)?   I would guess that I am less emotional and more analytical and rational about all of this than most people.  Perhaps it\'s partially defensive denial, who knows?  I\'ve always been a calm, analytical type who disapproves of hystrionics.  I think it\'s a healthier route than many other people are taking.  No one benefits from panic. Good luck with your study.  I hope you learn a lot and can use your results in useful ways.  Thanks.\"\"Not much.

'I don\'t think my behavior has changed but I do have a sense of fear now because I\'m constantly wondering what\'s going to happen next.I think it could have been Bin Laden because he has a true hatred towards the Unites States and it wouldn\'t shock me if it was him. He really is a smart man.\"I was deeply saddend about the events that occurred on September 11. My heart goes out to the families and the victims that were and are affected by this tragic event. This truly is a tragic thing that has changed the lives of all Americans.  A couple of days after the bombing, I went to work to pick up my schedule and around 3:30, the police came in and said that there was a bomb threat in the mall. I work at the theatre in Bay Plaza where the bomb threat was and we had to go to each and every theatre and tell everyone to evacuate the building. It really didn\'t dawn on me that everyplace would be affected until I saw military tanks driving by the theatre and the cops telling everyone to get as far away from the building as possible and across the parking lot. I was so afraid and angry at the same time at the customers because as soon as we got out they were complaining about refunds. Yes, they were going to get refunds but that was all they were worried about. They would rather have their $5 than their life.  My biggest fear right now is what is to come in the future. We have to constantly think about what they are planning to do next. So we has citizens have to live in fear now. It is good to see that Americans have a proud sense of patriatism but it is sad that it has to be this way. \"Because they are jealous of the United States because of our freedom.Because we don\'t believe what they believe and we are a free country and people want to live hereI\'m so mad that we let so many different people into our country and then they kill our people. I hate that. I don\'t want to go to war but I know we have to defend our country and I understand that it just scares me. I feel so sorry for the families of the people that were killed. Most were just begining a family and children lost their parents. It just makes me sick to my stomach thinking about all of the lives that were lost for no reason. They didn\'t do anything wrong. All they did was go to work that day. Bin LadenI don\'t fret over the little things anymore. You never know when life will be taken away from you. And I will not fly anymore or let any of my family!\"Shock, Anger and Frustration.  America has been warned for a long time about the dangers of terrorism and had warnings about impending attacks from both Israel and India.  How could this have happened?!  There is also a little voice inside warning this is all just bad karma coming home to roost.  Will the world ever feel safe again?  I am worried India will turn into another israel.  I am very angry with all muslims in general.  What is the point of a religion that doesn\'t preach compassion?\"\"More patriotic, less compassionate towards muslims and their suffering in Palestine/Iraq/Afghanistan.  A desire to see India as a hindu country.  When Bush can hold national prayers in the cathedral why can\'t Vajpayee do it in a temple?\"Most muslims don\'t have brains or hearts.  Just fanaticism.  I see them do such acta everyday in various parts of India. \"The Dr.  from Egypt, the onw who is next in line to head Al Qaida.\"To slap the face of the  global giant .\"I am not sure, but I know that we WILL find out. When we do find the people who are responsible....if it is Bin Laden, they will pay for their acts.\"\"I am not one to cry, but watching the television just got to be too much and I broke down.  How could anyone think that the loss of innocent life could be a victory? It still makes me tear up everytime that I think about it.\"\"I try to live each day to the fullest, and not regret what I do, and do what I would regret missing. Anything can happen at anytime.\"They are deluded fanatics with little regard for their own lives let alone the lives of others.\"I am appalled that ANYONE on this planet would consider taking innocent lives just to make a statement about a perceived injustice. It sickens me. We must band together as a global community to eradicate this cancer from civilized society. People who would commit such heinous acts are no better than rabid animals and deserve no better than to be put down. These people are deluded by a fanatical, religious opiate that impairs their judgment and demands they behave with intolerance and violence towards anyone who does not believe as they do. I am hurt that we, as Americans, clearly some of the most tolerant and generous people on earth, could become targets of such evil. The fact that these people were able to move freely in and out of our country is a testament to the trust and tolerance, the freedoms that we all enjoy. I am amazed that anyone who lived in our society for any length of time and enjoyed such freedoms, could perpetrate such crimes. Yes, I believe we should retaliate, but we must be careful to act on facts. We do need to send a message that we will hunt down those that would harm us (or those who would support and harbor such people) and they will be punished. My fear is that, even in doing this, it may not make a difference to such fanatics. Their mindset is such that dying is the least of their fears--they want to be martyred. I cannot focus on this for long because it is so depressing. I have to concentrate on the good that is in our nation and the beauty and joy of living in such a great country as America. I have to believe, and keep my faith in God, that justice will prevail and that this horrible tragedy will only make us stronger.\"\"To realize that some of the everyday problems mean little in the scope of what is really important--life, liberty, friends and family.  We are probably more cautious when using public transportation, more aware of those around us. More security at airports, and actually in any mass transit system, while time consuming, will be tolerated and appreciated.\"\"Fanatical, religious terrorists, possibly led by Osama Bin Laden.\"It sucks. because they\'re derranged and they\'re taught to hateosamanone except i am flying in november because of all the cheap airfare sales\"My first thought was that it was the beginning of World War III we witnessed on television on september 11. I felt horrified at the sheer mass of destruction of human life and buildings. At first we thought that 50.000 people were trapped inside those falling buildings. Thank God they weren\'t. The feeling of safety that I as a Danish citizen had experienced since the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union was gone. I grew up in a country at the border of two superpowers threatening each other with atomic weapons, which was a feeling of constant anxiety about our future - or if we had a future at all. The end of the cold war meant a new feeling of safety, that crumbled on september 11. together with the World Trade Center. Now Denmark like all other NATO countries is a country at war with Afghanistan. I am most worried about the future that faces my 2 year old son. My deepest wish is that he may grow up in a peaceful world without the fear that my generation experienced.\"\"Some muslim terrorists. I don\'t know if it is really Osama bin Laden, but it is striking that the only people feeling joy about this whole thing is muslims.\"\"Some muslims see it as their holy duty to wipe out all people of other faith than themselves. They think they will go directly to the finest part of Heaven for killing non-muslims. That may be the reason. Plus, the desire to do something bigger than everybody else had ever done.\"My behavior hasn\'t changed except for the fact that I have had to lie a great deal to my 2 year old son to protect him against the nightmare we have been exposed to on television.Osama Bin Laden\"I am so confused about all of this.  America is an understanding, loving, and diverse country.  We, in no way, are mean to muslims. Because of our understanding of diversity, makes me so confused on why they hate us.  I have never done anything wrong to the people in Afghanistan, and I am sure the victims of 9-11 were the same. We are inoccent bystanders, living in a country that believes in freedom.  My freedom is gone now.  I also think that George W. is doing a great job.  He took the time to find who did this, and to get other major countries behind our decisions.  It was almost a month before he decided to attack them.  This is a sad way to get Americans united...but we are so strong right now!  \"\"More patriotic, greater fears in biological warfare!\"Jealousy of the success of our countryI am very happy that we didn\'t immediately go off and bomb poor Afganistan. My daily behavior has not changed. I refuse to live in fear or anger.\"I believe it was a tragic, horrific, shocking event. I was deeply saddened for the survivors of those who were killed. I was even sad about the loss of the WTC, though I never liked the buldings. I also believe it should have been expected and prevented. I was greatly worried about how Bush and his cohorts would react, because I think he is an idiot. I believed then and now that his actions in ignoring the Middle East, and his arrogance in dealing with the world in general were a primary cause of the events.  Except for a few very brief flashes I did not feel angry. Rather my first reaction was that we need to get to the heart of why we are hated so much, and then we need to change that. We need to change ourselves, not bomb other innocent victims. Of course I hope the perpetrators are caught and punished (but not put to death). But my more fervent hope is that America will wake up and realize that its part of the rest of the world, that humanity is really ONE and that we must change our ways if we are to avoid disaster entirely.     We do not have a television set so we have not been tortured by the sight, over and over and over again, of the disaster, the crash, the collapse. Perhaps I would feel differently if I had been subjected to that. It\'s a little like being brainwashed I think. No one needs that kind of torture. I am still feeling distraught over the events of 9/11, though I go about my work and daily life basically unaffected. No one I knew was lost or injured; that would probably make a difference in the way I feel.  I do not want war. I feel as though I will have to live through Vietnam all over again, and I thought we\'d made more progress. I\'m deeply disappointed in the American government\'s reaction, but I am very proud of the heroism and caring that was shown, and that is still being shown across America. That\'s the kind of country I want to live in. Not one that is ruled by revenge, retribution, and hatred.\"\"America has been bullying people and countries ever since the second world war. Our greed, arrogance, and narrow-minded determination have twisted the views of those who know only what they see in their own media and hear from radical leaders. I think it\'s a combination of radical, sickened religious beliefs, and a misunderstanding about the West.\"\"Probably bin Laden, but I don\'t believe it can be entirely pinned on him. \"stronger appreciation for my family more prayerful more introspective about how I spend my time--a shift in priorities to what is truly important--the people that I care about I would not be willing to fly or take a train without great considerationbecause they hate us and want to eliminate us; our values are completely foreign to themOsama bin ladenSome freedoms have been taken away from me. I am angry and afraid. My personal safety is not as secure as I once felt. I think the event was pure evil and that the perpetrators are evil. I fear for my 20 year old son; I do not think he has the temperment to  go to war.  I worry about the next terrorist act; I am especially worried about biological weapons being used against us.  The possibility of a nuclear holocaust also frightens me.

The form of the attack was, however.  It was a  grand  attack, well-planned, almost theatrical in nature.  After the original attack on the WTC, I always felt that they would come back and finish the job, so even the site of the attack was not surprising to me.  I suffered from free-floating anxiety for about 2-3 weeks after the event, had trouble concentrating, was sad, and spent quite a bit of time re-assessing what I want in my life and what is really important to me.  I have been telling lots of people how much they mean to me (something I\'ve done before, but do even more so now).  I expect biological and chemical attacks and I see them as inevitable.  In a way, we are still in an  innocent  period of time when we can still eat food without fear, drink water without fear, and breathe without fear.  The anthrax thing is just to make us nuts, and it hasn\'t really gotten to me.  It\'s the next step in this escalating situation that I am the most worried about.  I feel that life can never be the same, and that the whole world is spiraling into chaos.\"\"I think that it\'s hard to tell.  The U.S. was irresponsible in letting airline security deteriorate, the public health system deteriorate, and the last 8 years were spent on political fighting about Bill Clinton.  A complete waste of time and money, and no attention to the important international issues that needed our attention.  This left us vulnerable to attack, allowed our borders to the porous, and set us up for this.  We have let people into our country who shouldn\'t have been here, big business benefited while conservatives claimed they were against immigration, and they should all be ashamed.  I think that Bin Laden and Hussein and others are having a heck of a good time playing off of our own arrogance and inattention.  They did it, but we made it easy for them to do it.\"I tell people that I love them more frequently.  I look at the stars in the morning and tell them how I feel and thank them for being there.  I savor everything more.\"I have been less cheerful, more subdued, less active, and certainly less productive. \"\"shock, disbelief, numbness were the initial reactions.  This lasted about five days or so.  Then I felt very angry and wanted to aggressively redirect my anger at the guilty party.  Now I feel sad, and like I am grieving some one I lost, but I lost no one that I personally know in the attack.  I also feel disgust for people who could actually do such a thing.  \"\"directly terrorists, indirectly hate, bigotry, the human thirst for positive punishment and control. \"\"need for control, evil, sociopathic\"\"I appreciate my loved ones more; that is to say, I\'m more demonstrative about it. Whenever I see a plane, I fully expect to see it crash into a building, but that is not really a behavior. I am much more aware of planes flying near my home and when I hear one, I look up to see if I can locate it.  I\'m a little more somber in general. I avoid the news when I feel  burned out  on it.\"\"Hatred of America and what America stands for, and perceived wrongs. Enjoyment of destruction and death. Religious fanaticism and misguidance.\"\"Today is Sept. 25, two weeks after Sept. 11, and I must say that I\'m still having a hard time believing what happened. It still seems surreal, incredible, nightmarish. I feel deep sorrow when I think of the lives lost. I think about the people who might have died quickly without much suffering, and those who might have lived for a few days in pain and confusion. I think about the passengers on the plane who knew they were going to die. I feel very, very sad about all of this. I feel terrible for all the people who are waiting for their loved ones to be recovered from the wreckage and identified. I have cried while watching their emotional stories on TV. I feel glad that this country is uniting, and other countries are showing their support. I feel proud to be an American. I feel enraged at the people who are indiscriminately hurting Arab or Arab-appearing people. I\'m worried about the potential happenings if/when we have a war. I feel that a retaliatory strike is mandatory, but I do feel sad about the suffering of innocent people who have done nothing. Above all, I strongly wish (of course) that the events of Sept. 11 never happened. No one will ever be the same.\"\"To state the obvious, the people who hijacked the planes. Whoever financed their activities. Whoever collaborated with them in the planning and execution of these attacks. Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist buddies? The more I hear about them, the more I agree that it certainly sounds like they were behind this.\"bin Laden and his cohortsI don\'t know.  Zealousness.  Groupthink.\"It shakes how I feel about the world.  I never imagined that this could happen.  I have a 17 month old daughter; I am afraid for her, growing up in this scary time.  I feel bad for Muslims and Arabs now who are the targets of aggression and suspicion.  I am impressed with how many people have responded in quite prosocial ways.  I have mixed feelings about being an American. \"I am more nervous about flying.  I have felt difuse anxiety since then.  I appreciate my loved ones more.They feel the US needs to pay for what it has done to other countries. \"When I first heard the news, I was scared and wondered what would be  hit next. I then became concerned about how I was getting home that night. While I think what happened was horrible, I have never once cried about it or had PTSD-like symptoms. I believe the US should seek revenge for what happened, but I think it is unfortnate that Afghan civilians will have to lose their lives. In the end, I am overwhelmed by all of this and wish I could escape from it. I am tired of hearing how awful it was and how people have been so deeply affected by it. It reminds me that I am either in denial about how it has affected me or it just hasn\'t. \"It hasn\'t.\"I\'m not one to jump on the Osama Bin Laden bandwagon. While the US seems to feel he is responsible, I will make my final decision when they release a document  stating specifically while they feel he had any  involvement. \"\"To make a statement that can not be ignored, and to instigate a response from the USA (to bring our forces over there where the attacks will undoubtedly continue)\"\"If I have to name specific people, I believe that Osama bin Laden and his followers are behind it.  However, I think that it is naive to blame individuals without looking at the potential causes for their actions.  I would rather blame the inequities and poor political interactions between the USA and the countries of the middles east.\"\"The events of September 11th are a tragedy for our nation, but especially for people who had friends or relatives hurt or killed in the attacks.  Luckily, the people I know who had a reason to be in the WTC were not hurt.  I am deeply saddened by the stories of the people who did not survive.  In fact, when I see the footage of the attack -- the planes flying into the buildings and the buildings collapsing -- it is not as disturbing as I would expect it to be.  I think that this is because I have grown up in a time of blockbuster movie special effects.  The scene does not seem real to me.  I only felt personally in danger for a short time.  When I think about the individual people, that is when I break down.  Can you imagine being on a plane and seeing what is about to happen but not being able to stop it?  Or the emergency workers who continued to enter the building, even as it was collapsing.  Or being trapped in a stairwell because your wheel chair can\'t make it.  Some of the worst stories for me to think about are the ones in which people called from cell phones.  If I could only have a few minutes to talk to the love of my life before I died, the last thing I would want to talk about is the details of the attack.  I can\'t imagine how sad that must have been.  I feel so sorry for all of the families that have been hurt by this tragedy.  I am also scared of how other Americans are reacting.  I don\'t know what I would do if I were Arab-american.  I understand that people are angry and frustrated, but they can\'t hold an entire race of people responsible for the actions of a few.  I fear that this attack is only going to make us retaliate in a bigger way, and then we will go back and forth and more innocent lives will be lost.  Where will it end?  This is a scary time to be alive.\"\"I say  I love you  or  take care  more to my family and friends than I did before.  I watch the news more than normal, but I always watched a lot.  \"no clueI am much more patriotic the taliban\"September 11th, a day to remember.

He has handeled this attack so well, that I feel safer than any other time.\"Because they believe in something very strongly\"My deepest thought and feelings regarding Septemer 11th are of shock, confusion, and sympathy.  Shock because of the disbelief that any group of people would carry out such a horendous act of terrorism.  Confusion because of the reasons that the terrorists have for carrying out the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans.  And Finally sympathy for all those who lost loved ones.  I also feel great sympathy for all the Muslim Americans and other Muslims world wide who are having to suffer accusations and suspisions for the actions of a groups of extremists.  Especially the Afgan refugees who are suffering in a country that is torn apart.  I also feel sympathy for all Americans because we have lost a sense of security that has been established by all our ancestors who gave their lives to live in this great country.\"I do not look at airplanes without feeling a pang of fear.

I hug my family more and longer. I meditate in silence trying to clear my mind of the pictures of the event. I don\'t watch alot of TV.For the first day I felt like it wasn\'t real. Like it was some huge joke and I wouldn\'t have been mad at all to find out that it wasn\'t real. Then the next day it set in. a kid from my college lost his father and so many other pewople lost their loved ones as well. I felt like it was a personal attack against me and every other person in the us and aroudn the world. These people are very sick and twisted. They need to be punished severly. We need to kill every one who was involved with planning this attack and undertaking it as well. No one messes with the United StatesI think about what might happen in a public place.

Then there should be a real effort to work on eliminating the roots of such hate and anger.I think that what has happened is a threat to our national security and the population as individuals. I am glad that the nation has done something and are taking action.  They are trying their best to catch whoever is involved and gather useful information anyway possible.Whoever has done this is a coward because they are afraid to admit it and they are hiding backstage while everything happens.I think more about the country as united and I try to find ways to help even if they are small ones in OhioMany fanatic religious people will do anything if they believe that it is what is expected of them.According to the media most fingers are pointed to Bin Laden. I would agree but I also like to think that we don\'t zone in on one person and not find who is really responsible if in some case Bin Laden is innocent.It hasn\'t really - although I will not be planning any travel into the middle-east until I know what\'s going on\"I initially didn\'t really know what the attacks might mean for me (being in NZ and all) and so was concerned and sorry for those who were suffering but felt relatively distant and unaffected.  Also, before I realised how many people would be affected by these attacks I was almost sympathetic to those who carried out the attacks in terms of finally getting to express their anger and frustration with the terrible way America has treated other countries through economic (and pyhisical, societal etc) forms of control and manipulation. As the implications began to become more clear and after I had seen much more of the footage of the attacks and devastation, the enormity of the event began to sink in. So many people died, so many families have been torn apart  - and what is worse, it seems that these lives are just the beginning of the death and destruction that will occurr world-wide because of these attacks - It is a frightening and tremendously sad moment of this world\'s history.\"\"Because they want to fight back. America is not the friend of everybody in the world - believe it or not.  Also, I saw a documentary on the whole thing and some of the muslim leaders were saying that to lose a few lives (that of the suicide attackers etc)was not a great deal to sacrifice if they could usefully fight their \'opressors\' and promote Islam.  Thus they value lives in a different way to us, the death of 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 civilians is just part of the battle, they do not seem to calculate the loss of life as we do\"Who knows...the media says its Osama Bin Laden\"I watched with horror the events of Tues., Sept. ll.  At first, it seemed unreal or far removed from me and my life.  I have been struggling with depression for several years now.  I had become so distanced from my feelings and emotions that I was unable to cry.  The pictures of the planes crashing into the buildings just left me numb, but the images of people jumping from heights that they were certainly jumping to their deaths are what finally allowed me to cry today, one week later. I am still depressed, but no worse than before.  In fact, perhaps I am a bit better since I can now cry. As horrible as this attack was, I have been so encouraged by the outpouring of support by the American people, opening their hearts and pocketbooks to help those who were personally hit by this tragedy. As a Christian, I have also been encouraged to see our nation, who as a whole has tried so hard to push God from our lives, turn to God for help.  I realize that this is probably short-lived, but perhaps some will truly find that He is real and can make a difference in their lives. I am sad.  I am angry.  I am angry at the men who did this.  I am angry that our intelligence community did not know about this in time to stop it.  I am angry at the changes this will make necessary in the way our citizen move with freedom around our vast nation.  I am angry that I feel fear at being in large groups--large buildings, landmarks, stadiums for fear of a large group of people will become a target.  I am angry at Americans who have taken their displaced anger out on other Americans who just happen to be from the Middle East or from that ancestry. I know that anger is a part of the grieving process, so I guess, now that I have cried, I am moving on with grieving.   I want my secure life back.  I want my secure country back.  I know that I will never have them back again. It only goes to prove what I already knew, that the only safe place, no matter what happens, is in the hollow of God\'s hand. \"I suspect that bin Laden is only partially responsible.  I think that others or other countries may have had a hand in it.Because they are mislead in their beliefs to the point of insanity.I am more vigilant for my own safety.

'I think for someone to do something like this they would have to have alot of built up animosity against the United States. They in some way felt wronged by the United States and plotted to seek their revenge.I don\'t know. If I knew the person by name I would say them. But I can\'t do what everyone else does and name a certain group of people because that is not fair. Yes I do believe that it was a small group of people who actually did it but I don\'t feel that everyone of the same cultural background as the culprits should be blamed.\"I had mixed feelings about the events that took place on September 11. My first feelings were disbelief. I was like   how could two planes just come out of nowhere and hit the twin towers . The whole thing didn\'t seem real. Then as reality began to set in I felt bad for all of teh innocent people who died. Then the media talked abou how all there people sacrificed their lives when in reality someone eles sacrificed their lives. Then I began thinking of ow such a thing could take place without anyone knowing. With all of the technology America has, no one could detect eight planes turning off route. No one thought it out of the ordinary for a plane to change destinations while still in the air. This right here was hard for me to believe but hey, everyone has there off days.\"\"The ony thing that has changed about me since September 11. is my attitude towards life. Now I see how short life is and I try to be productive everyday. Even if it\'s just going outside for a little while everyday. I just don\'t want something to happen and I will end up saying something like,  damn all I did was sleep my life away .\"\"i am in a state of hyperarousal now, expecting the worst at all times\"\"brain washing, cult-like fanaticism\"can\'t say for sure.  looks like the Taliban - bi laden.\"as an international student at a US university, i was in my home country at the time of the trade center crashes.  i didn\'t want to come back.  don\'t know why i did, actually.  this is horrifying.  stop the violence. stop the hate.  nothing will bring the incinerated people back; this is a country still using the barbaric capital punishment idea, however.  it\'s not supposed to make sense, i guess.  we won\'t escape this one unscathed. \"I have become more aware of making choices in line with my values. eg. family firstCompletely different value sets.  Relatively cut off from the western world - therefore no exposure to broad experiences - follow what they have been brought up to believe.I can\'t spell his name - Bin lardum and the Taliban  -  this is what the media has told us!I am still at a loss at how to express my thoughts and feelings about the attack.  That is one of the reasons I was keen to participate in the study - in hope that it would help me to identify how I feel. It has rocked me to the centre of my being.  Viewing the event on the TV is too unbelievable to be true - one could be left believing it must be a movie.  My greatest fear comes from the inevitable subsequent actions and reactions and what this might lead to.   What I find most disturbing is seeing the pain suffered by those who have been left behind.\"Very little, but I live on a remote island.\"\"The events of September 11th saddened me deeply.  I\'ve traditionally been fairly reluctant about patriotism.  But as I aged and travelled, I came to realize that America is, after all, a pretty spectacular place.  Our ability to travel and relocate our homes freely and to explore new career options, etcetera, all without fairly little discrimination or governmental control is actually quite rare and, indeed, wonderful.  As soon as I heard about the attacks in New York, I realized that all this will probably change soon.  I imagine that soon we will all be subject to increased scrutiny and decreased civil liberties.  I also imagine that we will see a rise bigotry and xenophobia. As a parent of two young children who was hoping (albeit wishfully) about raising children in an era of increasing harmony, I am sad.\"Fear.\"If I were to believe the media, I would of course say Osama Bin Laden, or at the least, the terrorist networks of which he belongs.  I\'m certainly not 100\% convinced, but this is probably true.  I will nevertheless withold my judgement until I see more evidence.\"\"I have become more sympathetic to countries who are victums of terrorist attacks, like Isreal. I have also become more wary of the way our country treats others.\"Out of frustration and hatred.\"I feel that the events of September 11th are a kind of rift in American History. I think that the fact that we as an American society are not immortal or untouchable disturbes people, and causes a great frustration that leads to war and hatred. The fact that a group of people that we feel superior to could hurt us in such a profound way is usually unthinkable, so what happened is completely out of our realm of reality.  What happened was a great tragedy, and most every one in America is grieving, but I hope it is for the right reason. I just want to know that there is as much grieving for the actual people who died and those who still might be affected by any other hostile actions that might occur as there is a grieving for the idea that we are safe. \"\"A terrorist group. Probably the Taliban, Ossama Bin Laden.\"Osamam Bin Ladan and his followersI am more scared for the world than I have ever been in my entire life!Because their sick minded fools. Maybe they wanted to bring down because they think the US for  siding  with people....\"What happened on the 11th was shocking. These people came to attack us, and we had our pants down the whole time! I do think it was the Muslim terrorist group with Osama Bin Ladan. I do not think we should treat every Muslim-looking person in America with anger and disrespect. I feel scared now... because i know a war is going to come of this and it can likely ease us into WW3. And all those innocent children who lost their parents, or people losing thier family members. It\'s just so horrible.\"\"Not much.  I feel less inclined to travel; however, I did not travel much before.\"\"From their perspective, maybe they feel they are on a religious crusade.  I personally do not feel that any true religion would condone harming innocent people.  I also believe they are jealous of democracy and perhaps are ignorant about our culture.\"Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban network as well as other supports yet unknown\"I was horrified by the event.  At first it did not even seem real to me.  I felt extremely sad.  Although I did not know anyone personally who was injured or killed, I mourned as if I did.  I was very sad for several days and it was difficult to have a sense of humor.  I really felt sick to my stomach.  \"\"Perhaps the 60\'s were the end of the innocence for the United States. But September 11th was the end of the age of naivet .  It was bound to happen. After the Cold War, previously concentrated pockets of both arms and organization, were dispersed. We carried on. War was raging in different parts of the world, wealth coming into the hands of those, (quite frankly, I think) with not much to do, common opportunists emerging with a chance for power by solely calling out  down with America! . We carried on. Our films and TV shows and pictures of  America  as a land of Baywatch beautiful, 90210 rich, Nordic Track healthy, FRIENDS happy people  - anathema to those poor, ravaged and prayerful. While others suffered, they must of thought (their governments neglecting to mention the money and services we give them), that we were a garden of Godless children dancing about, smiling and exchanging spouses.  What a perfect image to hate and use as a rallying effigy! So rather than turn their energies to making their lives better by demanding more from their religious and business leaders and government   they turned outward ------ not unlike the child that is teased or worse: ignored, at school   spending his nights thinking  Ill show them    only to show up at school one day, militant, judging, insane with jealousy and misfitness   shooting the archetypes of beauty and happiness.  But just as turning into a murderer doesn t give the weak power   doesn t gain the unloved respect   and only serves to further the chasm between they and  them  ---- so did this.  Yes, I was shocked. To the core. But then I thought of the bombing of London. Of Europe whose nights, for years, were filled with bombs, fire and death. I thought of the movies that I saw, (I m 30), where women were with their families during a raid, in the Underground, knitting!, dust falling on them as the city above was shaken with bombs   with their stiff upper lips   faith in Divine Providence   and sheer British grit. That s how we shall be. We carry on, as well, you see. As ethnocentric as it sounds   there is a reason we lead the world. Its not because we have never been bombed (until last week) or fought on our own shores a foreign enemy. Its is because we are Saxon and Germanic at our core. Fearless and organized. Relentless. We have a greater spirit than these poor idiots that blame us for their own shortcomings. We carry on. We rebuild   and we are brilliant at using such as has happened to make us better, stronger, richer. It is our collective sense of noblesse oblige that made us give monies and support to all those countries (137 million to Afghanistan this year alone!!!!!)   but now. Bite me. We won t be as magnanimous to enemies. But we shall be twice as kind to their enemies! A great mistake has been made. I cried the first few days. Almost non-stop. But in the name of those martyrs   we carry on. And my generation will now prove to its grandfathers that we are made of the same stuff. Do I want revenge? Yes. I was pro-life (I m Catholic) prior to Tuesday. That has changed. It seems that murder is part of this human game. So fine. Better they than us.  And just like intelligent enemies of great culture, organization and spirit could not defeat u s- nor will these cowards who don t even have the balls to claim their work.  We carry on. \"Jealousy combined with depression and a sense of futility and desperate need to feel  important Im a bit more hostile when I see Arabs or Middle Easterners.

I am spending a lot of time reading the newspaper, thinking about the world situation and wishing I could have more say in how we respond to these attacks.  Otherwise they haven\'t changed much.\"\"Because they hate us.  They hate what the USA stands for--exploitation, wealth at any cost to others, theft of natural resources from around the world.  They also have a deep belief in a very fundamentalist faith that reveres a more puritanical world with no major corporate monopolies that spread USA culture to the rest of the world etc.  \"\"I am very upset about the attacks, but even moreso by the response to the attacks.  Our country is reponding in a way that will solidify the world against us and will leave the children of this country without safety.  We are all at greater risk now.  And I cannot help but feel frustrated b/c this all is happening b/c some fanatic people are angry at us for our terrible foreign policy in the Middle East.  If we had worked harder to help create a free and sovereign Palestinian state and had not abandoned Afganistan after the Russsians left, these attacks may never have happened.  We are to blame in part for this whole thing and until we take the responsibility to look at our own behavior in the world (should I say the behavior of our gov\'t) we will never be able to disarm attacks like these.  By bombing Afganistan we are making thousands of young adolescent Arab/Middle Eastern men into terrorists--we make the world a more dangerous place.  Our best approach now would be to strive to create peace in Israel/Palestine, to stop bombing and help Afgani people who have fled their country with food, shelter, and medicine.  To provide resources for Afganistan to build free schools, roads, infrastructure that can be used to enhance the livelihoods of the Afgani people.  Then, and only then, they might believe that we are NOT the monster bin Laden has made us out to be. Then, and only then, they might find a way to work toward constructive change and show an intolerance for bin Laden and his gang of terrorists.  We need to model to the world our strength as a peaceful country, our ability to help build bridges between differing views, our committment to making the world a peaceful, safe, and free place for all people, not just for the richest 0.5\% of the world.   \"\"Both the terrorists (bin Laden, maybe Iraq, and others) and the USA who trained and supported them for years!\"',3,-5,0,2,5,1.68,3.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.84,0,13.39,0,0,0,0,0,0.42,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.51,2.51,0,1.67,2.09,2.51,0,0.84,4.19,0,0,0,2.51,0,0,0.42,0,43.95,0,2.09,0,0,0.84,0,2.51,0,53.16,5.86,0,2.09,0,0.84,0,0.42,0,5.02,0,0,0,0,0,18.83,9.21,0.84,0.42,0.84,0,10.88,0,0,0.84,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0,2.09,Female
'to teach the americans a lessonnotbin laden and his people\"My initial recation was shock and astonishment: Is this really happening? Strange, to think that those twin towers are not part of the skyline of NY anymore. In addition to concern about the individual people involved, I do feel it\'s not that bad that this event has shown the vulnerability of the US and their dependence on other countries. Bush was really going too far in being arrogant and self-indulgent in international politics, acting as the lord and master of the universe. I can\'t help feeling that something good did come out of this, i.e. the US paid their debt to the UN and Bush may be less arrogant in the future. \"Bin LadenI dont think that my behaviors have really changed but I dont plan on getting on an airplane any time soonThis is the greatest tragedy I have ever lived through.  It is very unfortunate for everyone involved.  I agree that the US needs to retaliate against those involved but I am afraid that this is gonna turn into a world war and many innocent people will continue to die.  he felt he was justified because he did it for  allah No idea. How can I speculate other than restate what I hear in the media?Not at all.\"The acts of terrorism were horrendous attacks on the value and sanctity of human life. Only if you do not view life as sacred can you set out to kill. I find it hard to imagine how some people must sit around and dream up the most effective way to kill the largest number of people possible. They did a good job. This was a great way to murder thousands of people at once.  I was and am shocked by the enormity of it all. I\'ve long ago stopped watching the news because I find no value in reiterating the same information I\'ve already heard. I listen to the radio (NPR) because I think their stories help me make sense of what and why this happened. I remain deeply concerned about the violent response (both collective and individual) that the US and its citizens may have to these events. If you value life, you cannot justify taking it, even in retaliation for murder. It makes no logical sense. So while I hope and pray for peace, I am very aware that the US will likely respond by killing. Similarly, I know that some individuals will find justification for their long-held prejudices against Muslims (and those who appear to be Muslim). The ignorance and anger of a few will have a lasting effect on many innocent lives. \"\"Either someone has some sort of religious calling that makes them believe that they must do this and that these acts have made a difference, or the person/group must believe that they are punishing the US.\"I am more cynical about our government\'s abilities to do good in this world.  I have more closely analyzed the media in their legitimization of this war - I am saddened and believe Sept. 11 was only the beginning of years of distress on US soil.Because we do this all of the time in other countries in the name of democracysaddened by the tragedy but horrified by our media - I think they are in control of the situation  and have made the situation worse by the way in which they approach this subject matter.  I think this was a rude awakening to our country to be introspective - i have heard children ask quetions our government is not  why do people hate us so much .  I don\'t know what the solution would be but I do not feel confident that  Shrub  and Condaleeza Rice and their cabinet  can handle this.Our government policies in other countries\"Out of desperation, humiliation, and hatred\"\"I watched the TV that day with my parents. It was early evening in my part of the world when the news broke. We sat there, feeling stunned, unable to stop watching. I remember feeling that it resembled the way it feels when somebody dies - the momentary sadness, changing to disbelief that this could happen, and then changing back to sadness again when realizing what had happened. I cried when they showed close-ups of the people standing in the windows - that made it seem so real, and so truly horrible.  My feelings toward these events are complex. I know that if I was American, I\'d be demanding that something be done. But I don\'t think this is easily solved, and certainly not solved with violence. I think the point for the USA government must be to ask: Why did this happen to us? And what can we do to prevent it from happening again? This kind of terrorist attacks can and will be carried out, regardless of the security measures taken. In Israel, they already live in a kind of siege - is that how the Americans want to live? I feel safe in Norway. But I feel the safe places of the world have grown fewer.  \"\"Anti-Americans, probably with a strong religious conviction\"I spoke to a person I otherwise wouldn\'t have spoken to. Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist network\"I feel a deep sense of sadness and disbelief about the terrorist attacks.  I feel fearful about what might happen next, although I haven\'t stopped doing anything that I normally do in my life.  I want to believe that something good can come of all these innocent people losing their lives, and the only thing I can think of that might be good to come of it is the way America seems to be uniting and helping one another out.\"I am more aware of my surroundings and I feel more afraid that something bad will happen all the time.I think because they\'re mentally deranged\"I am more grateful for my life, family, and country to be able to deal with this in the manner it has.\"I believe it is Osama bin Lodin and his large network of radical Islam followers.In retaliation to acts believed to be offensive and corrupt.\"I feel horrified about the whole sequence of events that took place on September 11, 2001.  I will never forget just as my ancestors have not forgotten Pearl Harbor.  I understand that people who die in suicide bombings and such do it for relgious reasons and I understand that most of the world does not like the United States for political reasons.  I as a Christian being, forgive them for their acts but also feel like justice must stand.  No matter what the religion, murder of innocent persons is wrong and should never be tolerated.  I feel that the United States along with NATO, needs to show the world in all aspects of terrorism, that it is not acceptable no matter what.  I also think that if we as a nation give up any freedoms  because of these events then we will never truly be free. I also understand that if Americans lose their faith in the government and economy, we will repeat the Stock Market crash.  I know that in war, money, time, and targets have to be defined before rushing in and that the evindence should be examined so that nothing is missed or left out.  I also feel that the American public should also put their trust back into the airlines, or we will lose all that we have in travel. It all depends on the attitude of American citizens and it truly requires an optimistic attitude and outlook.\"whoelse BIn Ladin0because they were jealous of americas great power\"well i am an international student and i come from a country where there is civil war going on for the past 18 years, so when i was in my dorm room and i heard the news on the radio, i just said to myself, these things DO NOT happen in America. i was shocked beyond words. i didn\'t know how to react to it, i was used to hearing about things like bombs and suside, but not in america, this was the safe , super nation and i felt like its all gone now. but i was wrong, when i heard that we(america) was fighting back i was happy even though i know it meant more death, i thought they desevered it after the amount of people who had to die and loose there jobs because of them. they hit a world wide land mark, and no one messes with america. who do they think they are? \"To harm our economy and due to us as a country being involved in other countries affairs.This is debatable but I believe that it is someone from the Middle East.\" The events that took place on September 11, 2001 was very devastating in very many ways but eapecially for the victims families.  I would not call it a call for war as we are unsure of who actually is behind this assault.  Whoever did this should be punished for what they have done but I don\'t think that we should wipe out people and countries just for their beliefs because not all people are alike in thier beliefs or on the choices their government makes for them.  I feel that the way this tradgedy is being handled will only lead to further harm and greif for all who is involved!\"My ways have changed in the aspect of more time in prayer for the victims and their families and also this country that we do the right things.\"Ben Laden, politicians, supporters of terrorists, terrorists themselves. The blame has to be put on the shoulders of everyone that had to do to the whole situation that lead to this world catastrophy\"\"I believe I have been quite shaken by the events. I don\'t know people living in NY myself, but I felt anxious for people who did know somebody there. I was affraid to hear the number of deaths and hoped everyone survived. I felt bad for all the blood and the injuries caused by way too ambitious people (the terrorists). I cannot say they are evil, but I can say they only considered their opinions and convictions. How many people are now dead because of politiciens with different personal goals. I don\'t believe most people would have voted for war. These terrorists where only people who worked towards one politicien\'s goal. I was in NY myself about a year ago and it could of happened to me. But I am glad I had a chance to visit a great wonder of the worlfd before its destruction. I wanted to go as a volunteer, but being a student, and life goes on here, I was not able to. As well I think I would have been more of a nuisance than a help, since I would not have known what to do. I want to help, but I can do it here, only a few hours away from NY.

'\"I have no idea.  Pride in their country.  Trying to make their group look good because they were able to make the Americans fall.  Well guess what we didn\'t fall and get weak, we only became stronger.\"I don\'t know how to spell his name...Bin Laden.\"September 11, 2001 will be a day I will always remember.  To me America has always been a safe place to live and I\'ve always been proud to call myself and American.  On Sept. 11th I think the security and safety that Americans had once felt decreased.  I still feel safe living in this country but I now realize that we are not invisible to harm or in this case terrorist.  After the events my response was complete shock.  I never imagined that I would ever live to see something like what happened.  You always hear of events from the past such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor and never believe something like that could happen while you are alive.  I was stunned.  I cried.  My heart cried for all those who lost loved ones due to the stupidity of other people. So my deepest prayers went out to those who lost the ones they loved in the towers and those who were on the planes.  At that time my response turned to those who had led the attack.  My first response was to be angry and hate those who had done this.  But as a Christian, I prayed for those who had done this.  They need the prayers more than anyone right now.  I don\'t like who did this and I never will, but they still need prayers for only God can change them.  I don\'t know how anyone could do such a thing.  Thye have to be out of their minds to do what they did.  Another thing I took from these horribe events was the heros that we have working for us each and every day.  The firefighters go out everyday risking their own lives to save those of others.  They truly are American heros in my opinion.  It\'s been amazing to see the response of this nation.  I always knew that Americans stood strong for their country but the response after the 9-11 attack was incredible to me.  There is nothing like seeing the great American Flag waving in the wind saying we\'ve made it this far and we will continue to make it no matter what may come our way.\"\"Don\'t take anything for granited.

It was also a great shock that the president would have shot down us citizens aboard the airplanes over washington.  The value  of human life has gone way down under George Bush.

Now our president will probably start world war 3.\"unknown terrorists and we are somewhat responsible because of our lax standards.We should have finished  these people off years ago.I am a bit kinder to other people\"Anger, frustration, hatred, jealousy, madness\"\"The short answer is fundamentalist Islamic terrorists, but there\'s more. . . .\"\"First, I know you will be relieved to hear the the World Trade Center Chapter of Modern American History is all about my sister Sarah. Walowing in her important emotions and, secondhand, in other people\'s reverent, grateful responses thereto, during the four or five days immediately following the disaster, has been, well, just, uh, well, an extremely, er, well, TIRESOME experience. What we have all taken away from our all-too-frequent contacts with her has been the overwhelming impression that this is a Skyline Issue, which is admittedly an unusual and refreshing perspective, omitting as it does anay reference to, forinstance, loss of life or the imminence of World War III. She is devastated, heartbroken. She is responding with episodes of what she calls her  own quiet tributes , where she just stands. In public. Looking devastated. Possibly waving a small flag in a bereft sort of way. OK. I\'m over it. I\'m going to hell when I die, but I don\'t even care. I bet I won\'t even notice the difference. I couldn\'t watch TV after Tuesday. I thought perhaps not having watched it for so many years would make it at least interesting in an anthropological sort of way, but it didn\'t. I watched some Peter Jennings and liked him OK, but everything else, especially the local stations, were appalling. Stupid, self-involved, hypocritical drivel. I went back to radio and newspapers. I eman, I\'ve always thought people shouldn\'t watch so much TV, and I now think work and learning are the best remedy for these horrors. One can\'t focus on tragedies uninterruptedly anyway; the midn closes down. I am one of those people who can only count,  One, two, three, many , anyway, so it doesn\'t do any good to keep bludgeoning myself. Better to allow myself to be intermittently overtaken or surprised by slivers of the truth that can stab my heart and really convey something. I have been thinking about Osama bin Laden and what I think of as  the work of betrayal , which was the title of a book about Judas Iscariot some years ago. You know: it\'s a rotten job, but somebody\'s got to do it. Bin Laden had beautiful eyes, brows, and forehead - the rest of his face is more Other (dark, full-bearded, fleshy of nose and lips), so harder to see if one is stubbornly Northern European. He is not sanpaku, he doesn\'t look unbalanced, fanatical, pinched, or bent, just intelligent, serious, thoughtful. Yet, he is probably responsible for a monstrous happening, like Iscariot being  responsible  for the crucifixion. If we don\'t experience these cataclysms, do we become more and more complacent, cynical and isolated from one another, etc., etc.? If these terros prompt us, over the long haul, to think more clearly; of they prompt us upwards another step; if they strip away our superficial armor, how is that not somehow good, and yet, and yet. . . . I was always horribly uncomfortable with the Dore engraving of Judas in the lowest circle of hell, being eternally gnawed by Satan. I have now lived long enough and read enough to realize how, incrementally, we are making our way, as a species, toward enlightenment. Cardinal Bevilaqua\'s letter, read from the pulpit on Sunday, September 16, emphasizes the need to leave vengeance to God and, especially, not to take out our frustration or grief on anyone easily identified with the terrorists, i.e., anyone of Middle Eastern aspect. Doesn\'t it feel as though at least some people have learned something in the last years, decades, centuries, millennia? This is so many notches up from a Crusade/Holy War sort of mentality. The Philadelphia Orchestra concert the same day was obviously designed to remind us of our interbeing - humans of every possible shape, color, and flavor were gently showcased, along with the music. Because of 9/11, we have a chance to see how far we\'ve come and to keep on slogging toward the higher ground. I know the people jumping from the Trade Towers mostly died in noise and flame and fear, chaotically, but I keep imagining them falling silently, like snowflakes, or metamorphosing into a river of birds, or falling to peaceful music,  cry[ing], Thank you, Thank you! all down the air, like guests thanking their host at the door , in the long ago words of Annie Dillard. I feel widened and softened by their deaths. Is that very odd? Of course, we have had to deal with the extreme irritation provoked by people who clutch their raddled breasts and ask rhetorically how God could allow such a thing to happen, which suggests that the concept of a seamless weaving has not caught on amongst the masses, who are still trying to get along using the old idea of Him and Us. Sigh. People generally have an insufficient inability to comtemplate complexity. \"I close all my blinds in my house at night and double check to make sure all the doors are locked.

The whole event - especially the visuals on TV - were so surreal.  My next reaction was shear saddness.  I cried for days.  I\'d be in the middle of typing something at work and hear someone\'s stories on the radio in the background and burst out crying.  In fact the day of the event I pulled up to a client and the flags were at half-mast.  I couldn\'t help but breakdown in tears.  Now that I\'ve been listening to everything for a little more than a week I\'m still sad about the events, but a little sick of hearing about it.  All the emails, all the news, all the stories.

I was quite upset because numerous members of my family work in or around the trade center and others who are with the NYPD.

I have not been able to focus my thoughts since then. I\'m behind in my work. I go to sleep and wake up thinking about the people in the WTC. I don\'t really want to visit the US, but I have not changed my plans to do so. One cannot live fearing what \'might\' happen.  One has to keep on.  Life is scary now. The US is indeed ego-centric.  That does not make Americans \'wrong\' or deserving of the attacks. I have no answer.   The attackers seem to be better organised, financed, focused, and possibly even courageous than \'Western governments\', those whom I expect to protect me. And that\'s scary.\"\"When I first turned on the TV after the first plane had it, I was horrified  that such an accident could occur. My husband is a commerical airline pilot and it hit very close to home. Every commercial crash upsets me a great deal. When I saw the second plane hit, and the reality of what was happening dawned on me, I was first devasted at the loss of life and horror of this intentional act,  and then scared that this would continue. We really thought that this would continue to happen all over the country. We were concerned about friends we know who fly those aircraft and tried to get in touch with them, to no avail. It was one of the most scary moments of my life. I thought that it was the beginning of WW3. I knew that things would never be the same again. I thought we were going to die. And as the events unfolded, I faced mortality. I really thought that by the end of the day, we\'d all be dead. For the first month after the attack, I was glued to the TV, radio, online news. I wanted to know everything there was to know. And then, I couldn\'t take any more. I was tired of crying all the time. I was tired of nightmares every night. I was tired of avoiding standing by windows in case a plane came crashing through them.  Now, 5 months after the attack, the nightmares have stopped. But I still cry at any coverage of the events, or talk of the losses. Any time an ambulence or fire truck goes by I burst into tears. Every morning, I look out of the window an look for signs of smoke or some catastrophe. I turn on the news first thing in the morning  now, to make sure nothing else terrible has happened. I\'m not afraid all the time like I was, but I\'m just waiting for something catastrophic to happen. It\'s a horrible feeling.\"\"Live each day at a time and try to make the most of every day.

It brought back memories and uncomfortable feelings associated with previous disastorous events I have been involved with (Pan Am flight 103, the explosion of Chernobyl).  I have been praying a lot, and feel sad and concerned about the world we are leaving to our children. I am still somewhat in shock and in awe and disbelief as well. My life has chnaged very little yet, but I know that it will no doubt change profoundly in the future. I feel very old for the first time in my life.  \"I don\'t know\"I have been totally confused about this whole thing happening.  I am on an emotional rollercoaster right now, with no end in sight.   When I got the news at work that this happened, I was shocked and didn\'t really realize how terrible it really was (we don\'t have a TV at work).  I spoke with my Mother and she told me how bad it was.  I was unable to get to MSNBC.com or any other news website do to internet traffic.  I began getting anxious.   I could not focus on work, I ended up having to go home.  Then I saw it and broke down.   I do not know anyone that worked in the WTC or the Pentagon, nor did I know anyone that was on any of the flights, but I was very hurt and sad.   I don\'t know if what should be done.  I am very afraid of a war turning into a bigger war into an even bigger war.  I never thought I would see something like this happen in my lifetime.  I feel like I have been being sheltered my whole life living in the greatest country...the country that has the strongest government, armed forces and freedom to live.  I feel like I have been sheltered because I have never had to see such a tragedy so close to home. I saw the Gulf War, but I don\'t think that was a war by any means.  I think the worst is yet to come. I am scared and hurt...but scared more than anything.  I am afraid nothing is going to be the same ever again.  I have a brother in the reserves and I am afraid for him too.  I don\'t want him to go through this. It makes me happy to see so many people coming together and showing their patriotism.  It is too bad it took this to make that happen. I don\'t know how I should feel.  I feel crazy for being so emotional. I am so confused.\"\"I am anxious, keep asking myself if this was all a dream, on edge.  I have been trying to work extra hours to stay away from the news.\"I don\'t knowI don\'t know.  Hatred.

I went through therapy a few years ago and I remember talking about shame. How some acts are shameful and committed by people who have no shame. I think this is the case here. These people have obviously never had love in their lives. I can\'t imagine living like that. Not having anything to  live for. What is the point? I live on the West coast.

Indirectly, I think our government needs to share in responsiblity for events leading up to the terrorist attack.\"\"I believe that the terrorism occuring in the United States is a result of our  foreign policy.

I think that if the US government had been listening to the reasonable people with reasonable grievances over the last 50 years, that the amount and depth of destruction of the terrorist attacks wouldn\'t exist today.\"to get back at some one who has done wrongI thought that this tragedy was a bad one and when heaven and hell  were populated in a  a minute God welcomed them with open arms . we need to be able to let God work this oout in His time. tragedy happens daily and God puts us through these times to see if we are following him and what he wants us to do for him. that is what i feel about the time on the 11th .

Having said that, innocent lives are innocent lives, no matter where these innocents live. Innocent people have been killed at the hands of Americans in the Middle East for years. The US support for Israel in bombing places such as Beirut means they have associated themselves with terrorists just like the ones that attacked America this month. Terrorism is terrorism. America says they have to retaliate to the loss of innocent lives, which is absolutely fair enough, and a natural reaction to such an event, however, is the retaliation taken by those in Middle Eastern countries not exactly the same thing?? It is all terrible - there are no words to describe how angry I feel at the loss of any life, whether it be American , Afghani, French - whatever. War is not an answer to this tragedy. Finding and dealing with those responsible for terrorism all over the world should occur, but no innocent women, men and children (of any race) should die in the process.  As Bush has said, this should be a war against terrorism, not a war against Islam, or any other religion. Yes, fanatical Islamics, Muslims, and fanatics of any religion go too far, and people get hurt in the name of religion. They say they are following the word of god to the letter, but god would never deem the loss of life as essential for adhering to his word. However, as I said, this should be a war against terrorism - if this gets into a religious battle, the war will be a long and bloody one. Perhaps millions will be killed if the east and west are to face off in the name of religion.\"\"American has some shocking foreign policies which allow thousands to be killed in Middle Eatsern countries every year (for example, they supported Israel both financially, politically and with materials) for the bombing of Beirut and refugee camps in southern Lebanon where thousands of innocents died. Extreme Isalmic and muslim groups have reacted to these events by hating America and Americans and wanting to see and bring about their downfall.\"\"The people who flew the planes are repsonsible for flying the planes, as for the underlying \'mastermind plan\' an extremist islamic group, such as that headed by Bin Laden seems the most likely suspect. \"becaue they have so much hate in their bloodevery time i hear a plane i the sky i get paranoidone i think the goverment. two i think the arabian people\"on september 11, 2001 i was hurt. one because i didnt belive what i was hearing i thought it was a joke, and the when i realize that it wasnt a joke i thought i was dreaming.  i felt like a part of New York is gone and it would never be the same.  New Yorkers will forever be hurt and bruised.  we will never forget this.  but what hurt me the most was when i saw the people jump out the window and when i saw the buuilding crumble.  you will never think something like this would happen to us but it did.\"some humans somewhereThey must have really believed it was the right thing to do.\"I spend a lot more time just sitting and thinking.  I now go down to the river to get work done and take some time to see the beauty there.  I spend a lot more time talking about war and peace.  Since 9/11, I have spent a lot of  time on the phone with friends, first checking if they were still alive, then checking if they were emotionally ok, then trying to help them, b/c most of them are not emotionally ok.\"\" My little sister lost one of her closest friends. They\'d had an argument a  while ago and hadn\'t made up yet.  He\'s still  missing , not confirmed  dead, so his whole family wakes up each morning and spends the day  going from hospital to hospital looking for him.  Her other friend,  (the three of them are/were sort of a friendship triad) is staying at  the missing person\'s apartment b/c if he comes home someone should be  there.  He\'s not coming home. My sister can\'t reach the family, b/c  they have no phone lines.  She thinks they won\'t want to see her  b/c they might know that she and their son had had a fight.  I\'m  worried about her. That\'s just one cell.  Probably not covered on the news.  There are thousands of those cells. I have spent the last week calling people in NYC, in the area, who might have been in the area.  I find now that I am afraid to return a call I received  a few days ago from  someone I haven\'t talked to in several years.   I\'m afraid of why she is calling.  Just to see if I\'m ok?  Or to tell  me someone is dead?   I keep remembering people I haven\'t called yet. Now I\'m also worried about  people who I know are of Middle Eastern decent.  I should be working  on a huge project I have due and I have been, but is that any excuse  for not seeing if the people I care about are ok after something like  this?   And then I think.  Wow, I\'m doing a great job of making this about  me when it isn\'t.  Still, many things that seemed very important two  weeks ago, seem less urgent now. My 9 year old nephew thinks armed men are going to take over his  home and kill his family.  I\'m trying to figure out what to say to him  when he calls.  I do know that this is nothing new.  Man\'s inhumanity to man and all that.   I never wonder to see men wicked, but I often wonder to see  them not ashamed.    Remember us, if at all, not as lost violent  souls, but only as the hollow men, the stuffed men  etc etc etc.  But  then again, it has always made me upset.  I also figure that to the extent that there is some sort of balance in nature, then if humans  are capable of creating great beauty and having such immense compassion,  then it follows that they must also be capable of horror, destruction,  and cruelty.  But, I think I might give up the former if it would get  rid of the latter.  Of course, no one has given me that option, and  besides, I\'m still not so sure that the true force is balance and  not chaos anyway. I do love America.  I don\'t know how proud I am specifically to be  American or human.  But I don\'t think this is a time for  Americans  to  band together (aside from the fact that people in the U.S. aren\'t forming bonds with most American\'s anyway, b/c many American\'s are Canadian, Mexican, Central American, and South American).  But a time for us to see the  horror against humanity that has occurred.  And it is not a time for  us to bomb another country or send 18 year old boys off to their deaths,  but a time for us to heal ourselves and shun violence against our fellow men. I find that I seem to have a most unpopular opinion about this.  I have  had several arguments with close friends over this.  Have decided maybe it\'s not a good topic.  Last thing I want is for this event to create  anger between me and my friends.  I\'ve seen a lot of people fighting  more.  Cars pulled over with drivers screaming at each other.  Is that how we respond to violence against us, by being violent to each other? Mostly, I\'ve been terribly disappointed in the response to this tragedy. Mostly I find that I don\'t understand.  Is it easier to be angry than  to feel immense sorrow?  Maybe.   I still just feel the sorrow.  And I have also been able to see some  beauty come from that sorrow.  My sister may have actually have found  a way out of a lifetime of depression, due to reflecting on this  event - ironic I suppose.  Another friend of mine just gave birth to  her second child yesterday.  So, amid all the death, there are still  new beginnings.  And, I have found people here and there who remember  why peace was such an important idea at one point. But, when the 18-year old sales kid at a store where I was recently shopping told me that he was in the reserves and he hoped we went to war so he could fight, all I could think of was,  Oh, it would be so sad if you had to die too.   I didn\'t say anything.  He was young and he didn\'t know what dying was, or how horrible killing can really be.\"I\'ve been watching a lot  more TV and listening a lot more to the radio.  We don\'t know yet.  We may never know -- something we\'ll have to find a way to deal with emotionally.  \"Obviously, this was a distressing and horrifying event.   What bothers me most about it is that real human beings--people with unique lives and beliefs and projects and plans--were turned into symbols.  No human should ever be reduced to a symbol of anything: good, evil, capitalism, imperialism, whatever.  Turning human beings into symbols strips them of their humanity and turns them into the pawns of ideology...and we now see the violent potential in the simplistic impulse to symbolize.    The terrorists apparently thought they were attacking  America  -- an abstraction that one can take (sometimes violent) ideological issue with. In actual fact, they attacked and killed approximately 6000 human beings who happened to inhabit space in the landmass we\'ve agreed to call the  United States of America.  As I write this, I\'m listening to NPR\'s broadcasting of stories of the people who were killed or are missing -- what they did for a living, who their children and families are, what kind of people they were.  These people are symbols of nothing -- they were real people with real lives.  And their murder is a crime because they were PEOPLE, not because they were  Americans.   We as a group of people who occupy  America  are at a crossroads.  We now have the opportunity to set a different precedent--the precedent of insisting that we stop treating real  human beings as symbols.  We must dissent against the impulse to do this:  to characterize entire groups of people as  good  or  evil.   Without a doubt, certain individuals are guilty of criminal actions in this case:  murder.  These people must be found and brought to justice in a world tribunal.  War will not accomplish this objective; rather, it will allow us to turn human beings (many of whom are innocent) into symbols of  evil  that we can then  righteously  destroy.    Real people always have one tool that symbols lack  -- they can talk to one another.  They can engage in rational discourse with one another to attempt to find ways to solve their problems.  All people who have stakes in this issue (which may be every human being currently alive on this planet) should be regarded as having both the right and the obligation to engage in this rational discourse.  Terrorist acts are monstrous because they circumvent this process of rational discourse...and in the process, strip people of their humanity.  We must not succumb to the simplistic impulse -- however emotionally satisfying it might be -- to dehumanize other people by silencing their voices.  \"\"Because they believe that symbolic acts against material entities (people, buildings) that they are treating as symbols can in some way address issues of perceived injustice.\"I think all of humanity is responsible because we are a violent species.\"I am deeply saddened that this is the way in which humanity chooses to solve its arguments.  There is no excuse for such a horrific act.  I am further saddened by the way the people of the US are responding to this event.  I look at the news on television, and people are very drawn in by the President\'s cowboy mentality.  I just don\'t know what will make the US different from the terrorists if we go in and bomb civilians who have the misfortune of residing in the same country as bin Laden and his group.  War or acts of war are never without loss to someone.  I feel that all life is valuable-- everyone is, after all, someone\'s child.  I find it extremely disconcerting that people are so ready to seek revenge, particularly in a physical sense (as opposed to finding the parties and putting them on trial in the court of a neutral third party, so that the true facts of the case may be examined rather than outrage and emotion controling the proceedings).  Nobody, to my knowledge, has bothered to discuss the sociological or psychological aspects about why people committ terroristic acts.  The US has been pumping money and weapons into Israel for a long time.  Perhaps the Muslims in the Middle Eastern region felt outmatched, and unheard by the world at large.  Resorting to terrorism seems like an adaptive trait in that case.  Now, if I were to say that out loud people would not understand due in large part to the mob mentality of  justice.   Believe me, what was done was just horrible, and I in no way support that act, nor any other terrorist act.  I guess I just wish I lived in a world in which those types of things wouldn\'t even happen.  The US is a good place to live, comparitively; however we are not the  heroes  that we like to tell ourselves we are.  We intervene where/whenever there are US interests being threatened-- not because we\'re the  good guys.   That idea is a misconception lost on the vast majority of citizens.  Until humans can learn to be civilized with each other, what\'s the point of getting *really* upset about anything?  If we strike, if they strike, it\'s still someone child who is dead at the end of the day.  And nobody wins when that happens.  I wish you the best on this project.\"To make a point which went unheard prior to this (perhaps).  Or perhaps because organized religion is full of blind dogma which demands the individual be unthinking.  Or perhaps because humans are innately violent and destructive.  And then there\'s always good old hatred.\"I\'ve found myself talking/engaging less with people.  I don\'t want to hear about how we need to  go over there and kill them all.   On a more pragmatic note I\'ve found myself becoming mesmorized by aircraft overhead, particularly when out running at night.  I keep wondering if I\'m seeing the plane\'s headlights because it\'s pointed downward and heading toward my area.  I\'ve also made a firm decision to not fly again.  \"I don\'t understand why someone would take out their own anger in this way.It has not.Osama Bin Laden\'s terrorist group (ie I believe what I am told by the press about resposibility.)\"I was not surprised that the World Trade Centre was the victim of terrorism, it provoked because: of where it is its name what it represents Also, it had been attacked before. I was very surprised by the method of the attack.  I cannot understand the mentality of people who will follow a leader as far as to commit suicide. The horror of people knowing they were going to die and the way they died after the attack is something I think about several times each day. I think the event has brought people\'s attention more to the problems in the Middle East, which is good. I am much more aware, as a result of press comment, of possible future terrorism and of the importance of good  intelligence .

'\"The events that happened on september eleventh were astonishing and tragic.  Coming home from class that afternoon and turing on the tv, just seeing the terrifying tragedy that happened made me shiver.  This really hit home, i have heard my parents and grandparents talk about war, death, and tragedy, but you could never really understand it until you experince it yourself.  Now that we are at war because of these horrible terrorist atttacks, i am scared and nervous.  My friends who are in the army just 18-30 years old are being shipped off, who knows if i will ever see them again.  this was a tragic event and someing, some type of action needs totake place.

As of yet, we have not started an actual war involving bombs and invading armies, and I hope we don\'t have to do that.  It seems to me that moving troops around is a good form of psychological warfare.  I realize that we may have to physically (and publically) attack, but I hope it can be resolved with covert and financtial action.  I feel deep sadness that we may end up destroying another country, and deep worry that the terrain in Afganistan may destroy many of our people if we go in for a ground war.  I find myself wishing that an assassin can take care Osama Bin Ladin, and hope that will demoralize the rest of the extremists enough so they will leave us alone.  \"\"A Muslim extremist group, but I don\'t have strong feelings about which one is responsible.

I felt deeply saddened at all those people who lost their lives, but more so for their relatives and friends who they left behind who have to deal with the loss. I feel so disgusted and angry at the people who committed this act, and at first felt very bitter towards Muslims in general. I understand more now that they as a religion are not to blame, but it is still hard to feel like they are allies having seen those pictures on TV about them being happy about the bombing.\"They haven\'tTo cause conflict\"It is so difficult to absorb the fact that someone could do something this evil and that it would result in two large towers reduced into rubble not to mention the human lives lost.  When I first heard that a plane had hit the World Trade Tower on the radio, I turned on the television when I got to the office and could see the building in flames.  You could see people at the windows waving and I knew they would not be able to escape.  I felt very helpless.  When the second plane hit the other tower, I knew this was not just an accident and immediately knew it was the work of Bin Laden.  I don\'t know how I knew.  I just knew and told the other office workers that it was Bin Laden and they would find any weakness they could.  It was not over. I could barely concentrate that day to do my work at the office.  I kept looking to the television for more news because I did not know what might happen next.  Was there more horrors in store?  Then the plane hit the Pentagon.  All of this was so impossible to believe.  The United States was truly under attack, the place I always felt was safe from attacks like this! I was in a state of great anxiety and did not feel safe anywhere.  I had to watch the news on TV constantly to see what was new to develop and what countries would join us against terrorism.   Seeing the president react to this tragedy and my growing feelings of patriotism was calming and I shared in an American\'s feelings of determination to defeat this evil.  I was also concerned for our soldiers. I also had a feeling of sadness for a loss of innocence.  Things will not be the same again. It is unbelievable that these terrorists would be educated in our universities and turn this against us in an attempt to destroy our society.  I have lost some trust and feel a sense of betrayal. I am also sad for the children that must live in a world like this. I am also recalling seeing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie that showed him flying a plane through an office building.  They used our own culture against us. I am worried about what is in store for us in the future.  When I wake up in the mornings, I know all of the possibilities have been going through my mind because I am so depressed.  Once I get into the office and get back to my normal routine, I feel a little better. There have been times at home I have been able to laugh again, but I must take breaks away from the news to watch  Leave It To Beaver  and old movies to escape from this reality. I do have confidence in the world\'s ability to defeat this threat to democracy.  This is truly a war between modern culture and ancient culture.  We will prevail.\"\"I have attempted to go on with my normal life, but with great anxiety.\"bin Laden00I have become less trusting of people.\"Initially, I was horrified.  I felt really threatened, as though the world was going to  enter into a nuclear war.  I was extremely concerned about my son and didn\'t want him to watch the events unfolding on the television. I was very scared that it was going to be an  escalating situation.   Next, I felt really sad, especially when someone pointed out  to me how people were jumping out of windows.  That really made me feel ill.  I also kept thinking about the film  Independence day - especially with the huge cloud moving down the NY street.  Then I started to think about the incident and to realize that there were huge implications economically and  socially.  I then went into work and started chatting with fellow staff members.  They seemed shocked but I felt that they couldn\'t \'meet me\' emotionally so I kept quiet.  I was very keen to have access to web page news, but it was very slow.  Eventually, our department set up a television screen and we watched, while we tried to go on with our \'normal\'  academic duties.  I was very concerned for colleagues who had been watching the television overnight and hadn\'t been able to go to bed.  They seemed very traumatized.  A number of students were upset.  Later, I started to get concerned about people I knew who I believed  were in New York and I started emailing colleagues to check on them.   I have since compartmentalized the incident and the recent US response in my mind.  For example, I am often aware of thinking along the  lines of  well, that is a long way away  and  even in times of war, you have to  get on with your life .  I am however, very concerned.  A list-server group that I subscribe to over the internet has been discussing the events after someone in our group suggested that we might take some action: eg. express sympathy.  I have found a lot of the comments rather pathetic, especially given that people couldn\'t agree to even express sympathy to the victims and just wanted to make political points about it all.  I thought, how extremely academic and ineffectual. Even overnight (it is now the 10 October),  I was lying awake (for other reasons)and at one stage I was thinking about how widespread it could all become: especially when it is biological based.  I hope the world finds peace, but frankly, I am not that hopeful.  I am also concerned for future generations.  I am concerned because important issues such as the protection of the environment will take second place for a very long time to come.    \"I have fears and concerns and unhappiness and lack of interestThey are inhuman and uncivilized and want to take controlI think that day was the most traumatic day in my life and I\'m sure this is shared with many others. I have not been able to fully cope with the devastqtion from this  attack and feel depressed many times a week and saddened at the future of this country. It just was too close to home. I don\'t have that much interest in things since nothing right now has the same meaning as before Sept. 11. I do have fears and can\'t seem to get over them.osama bin Laden\"I haven\'t been terribly upset by this incident.  It\'s interesting.  I\'ve been trying to figure out why.  It may be, sadly, that I\'m getting used to mass tragedy.  I remember being far more upset by the Oklahoma City bombing in the hours and days immediately following it than I have been about this tragedy-- despite the fact that the death toll and devastation are far worse this time.  I was more upset about the Gulf War than I am about this.  These two events spring to mind because they are my previous experiences with as-it-is-happening news coverage of horror.  That surreal feeling of listening to or watching death happen, in real time, while you are safe and sound in your home, office or car reminded me immediately of those previous two events. The Murrah Building had a day care center and I had small children at the time.  My brother was active duty in the Air Force during the Gulf War and was eventually sent.  Did these tragedies affect me more because they hit closer to home, in the sense of registering somehow with my life?  I think that is part of it.  I think also, those two events and the 24/7, real time coverage was new for me.  It\'s old hat now. But what I fear is simply what I stated earlier:  I\'m getting used to this.  Yes, I felt and feel empathy with the families of the dead and missing.  I\'ve prayed daily (sometimes hourly) for them.  I especially empathized with the police, fire and ems workers in NYC. I think,though, that part of my ability to remain calm following this horror is that I know that God is in charge.  I have a deep sense of security in knowing that God is a God of justice and love.  He grieves with those families and co-workers and He can comfort them and bring meaning out of this for them in ways that I cannot.  He can also see to that justice is served.  International events are too big for me to control, but they aren\'t to big for Him! I have a kind of quiet confidence that in a God-run universe, nothing escapes His notice.  He is not a puppet master pulling our strings and forcing us to do His will (which is how hijacKing terrorists can get away with acting out the way they did).  By the same token, He has the final word in all events of human history and good will prevail because He will prevail. I don\'t know when or how He\'ll bring good out of this tragedy, I just know He will.  Because of that i\'m asking Him what, if anything, I ought to do to help.  My husband has given blood.  I\'ve been praying daily for my dear friend who was in lower Manhattan for a job interview at 9 am on Sept. 11. And simply listening to her as she processes her own trauma. So far, that and praying for wisdom for our leaders as they plan an appropriate response, seems to be what He has called me to.  But I\'m still listening...\"\"Envy, rage, misplaced religious zeal.

I am concerned for the individuals touched by this.\"It\'s not a  who,  it\'s a what -- an entire system of military manipulation and exploitaton.\"000\"I think the events of September 11th lead to a great deal uncertainty with respect to relationships across the globe. I feel concerned that the attack on the US will lead to conflict between and within countires of the world, as we have already seen attacks on muslims living in the US and the UK. Although I believe that the purpetrator of the attack should be brought to justice, I am also very aware and indeed frightened about the concequences that this may have.  I have been extremely moved by the situation and the media coverage and although I am fortunate enough not to have lost anyone that I know, it feels very \'close to home\'. It seems impossible that what would appear to be a relatively small group of people could cause mass destruction and it leaves me feeling extemely vulnerable and aware of the fragility of life.\"I have become more willing to tell those around me that I love them and am greatful to have them in my life.I am still in awe of the events of that day.  I don\'t think that even one month later it has hit me yet.  We still see images of the Towers and Pentegan as they were before everything occured.  It is hard to comprehend what it is that happened that day and how it is that we should be feeling.  I personally was extremely lucky and all the people that I knew where not hurt or lost in the destruction on that day.  I am still vrey effected by the new events unfolding each day as the sister of an elisted Airman in the United States Air Force.  Due to this I have made so incredible friends that I am constantly thinking of during this time.  I feel bad and so sorry about what happened to all those people that day but I think that they would be and should be proud to say that they were Americans and we able to live life to the fullest.  It has made me realize that things I thought were important a month ago are not so important now.  I have reconnected with those that I wasn\'t close with before.  I am hoping that with time I am able to realize the magnitude of what has occured and be thankful for what it is that I have been granted in this life.A radical faction of some group of people who blamed the United States for their current situation.because they feel that we are some kind of evil that we are sinners who need to be removed from this earth and existence.',4,-5,0,2,5,1.41,1.41,0,0.71,0,0,0,1.41,2.82,0,2.12,0,12.01,0,0,0,0,0,1.41,2.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.17,0.71,0,0.71,8.12,0.71,0,0.71,5.29,0,0,0,3.18,0,0.71,1.41,0,36.37,0,3.88,0,0,0,0.71,0,0,53.32,3.53,0,10.24,0,1.41,0,0.71,0,0.71,0,0.71,0,0,0,6.71,16.95,0.71,0.35,0,0,1.42,0,0,1.41,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0,0.71,Female

I think that it is ridiculous that they the attackers are calling it a guerra santa, you know like if US was the satan and they arew doing it for the love of ala. I also cant bear to believe that somebody could be so brain washed as to take their live and with that the life of thousands of innocent people. now the whole world is going to pay for this.

Its a good wake up call for all those U.S  citizens that are incredibly sheltered and ignorant to the world\'s events.  It makes me angry that it took something like this to occur to make people wake up and stand up to the inhumanities that are occuring in the middle east.  Additionally, I hear the argument on a daily basis that the U.S. doesn\'t attack civilian populations and we didn\'t deserve this.  I\'m not necesarily arguing against this statement completely.  I have to say that I agree I don\'t feel that ANY civilian population ever deserves to be murdered in such a manner.  However, I think its naive to state that the U.S. hasn\'t killed civilian populations, this is incredibly untrue! Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Vietnam, East Timor I can go on and on.  The past actions of the U.S. toward other countries has finally caught up with us. You only stay on top economically and politically in the world, The U.S. doesn\'t maintain its power from being nice but by taking military and economic action. People need to educate themselves, read, discuss and wake up! It\'s about time it\'s sad that something like this had to happen for people to open their eyes to the abuses that are going on around the world everyday, every hour!\"Craziness?\"Who knows, that\'s a complicated issue.  You can\'t just point the finger at one person or group.  Its a cascade of events over the last 20 or so years.\"\"My deepest feelings are that a tragedy with international significance and long-term repercussions took place on Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2001.  The immediate impact is that Americans are feeling every negative emotion - anger, rage, insecurity, fear, despair, sorrow, grief, the need to retaliate, etc. - as a result and that there will be no immediate relief from these feelings.  The coming weeks and the U.S. response may only compound these bad feelings. I believe the U.S. economy will suffer, air safety will become a top priority, and families and family values will take precedence in our lives.  Most Americans never believed they would witness something of this magnitude in their lifetimes, and now that we have... change is not only necessary, but mandatory.

That\'s about it.\"I dunno.\"I live in Manhattan on 12th Street between 3rd and 4th Ave on the 13th floor. I am a college student at Parsons School  of Design on 5th Ave and 13th Street. On Sept. 11th I was sleeping late and woke up at about 8:45 when my father called on the phone. He was extremely aggitated and upset asking me,  Don\'t you know what happened, terrorist flew two planes into the WTC  I\'m really stressed at this moment and pull the blinds on my South facing windows to see two flaming chunks missing from the WTC...it\'s surreal and I\'m thinking that today I will surely die, but I come to terms with this idea quickly and figure that if it\'s your time then that is it. I wake my sleeping boyfriend up as well as my two roomates and we are all in a panic and shaking. My father who is still on the phone tells me there may be biological warfare and I should get out of the city by ferry, and that all transportation is shut down and I\'m basically trapped in NYC. I figure the only reason they would trap everyone in the city is because there is a health threat and they don\'t want it to spread outside of the island.I turn the television on to see frantic reporters and footage of the planes crashing into the buildings. I\'m amazed and somewhat fascinated by the whole thing. Just then I see on the television one of the towers collapse and am confused, but turn around and look out my window and realize that it is live footage and is actually happening. The whole day was surreal. Looking out of my window I saw droves of people in business suits walking up town for hours(that\'s a sight you don\'t see often). I went outside and sat out front and was enjoying the contridicting day. A beautiful sunny clear sky day and at the same time there was cconfusion, fear in the air and inside I was in turmoil. I went through a list of emotions that day and dealt with my fear and anxiety with humor. I try not to let this effect me because I don\'t want to be engulfed with bad feelings that I can do nothing about.  I am a Resident Advisor for my college and my job is to help residents but I couldn\'t do anything, I felt helpless. The dorm my school has on William Street (Financial district two blocks from WTC) was shut down that day and no one could leave the building until late that night, I had to put a lot of those students up in our dorm for a week or more. I got so stressed out that I had to go to Long Island to take a little break. Right now it\'s hard to look out my window at night. There\'s a flourescent glow hovering over where the WTC was and it reminds me that there are a few thousand rotting bodies down there. I won\'t go below 4th street, I am trying to block all of this out. The air smells funny most of the time...burning rubber and a little bit of what I think is rotting bodies. I am wondering what I will smell when the bodies really start to decompose. I am currently taking an International Business class and it has given me insight into what is really going on in the world. I am unerstanding that terrorism goes on all over the world and this attack was just a matter of time. I also understand the tension that has been brewing in the middle east and why this happened and believe that this is not the end of it, but for now I am going on with my life and I believe in fate and that I will die when I\'m supposed to die. ameliadelaAThotmail.com\"\"It\'s a snowball effect.

There are people in the world who live under much more desparate conditions of poverty and war.  They have responded in ways that are difficult to understand from my vantage point.  Groups of people who have responded to their conditions using extreme ways of thinking have perpetuated that thought to others: young people who don\'t know any differently and are taught these ways of hatred, and people who feel that they either don\'t have any other options or that this is a preferred option to the others they are aware of.  People live by their beliefs.  Beliefs are taught, for the most part.  And once people hold beliefs, it is very difficult to change them from external sources.\"\"Renewed and continued awareness.  Attempt to be non-reactive as the media and others build up hype and rhetoric that is alarming and perpetuating fear rather than encouraging awareness and vigilance.  Attempt not to perpetuate the fear in those around me, but to be aware and responsible.\"\"First of all, I believe the events that occurred on Sept. 11th are horrific.  The people that were harmed and their families are the unwilling victims of the attacks.  I also believe that these attacks were a necessary wake-up call.  As a society, the citizens of the USA seem to have become complacent, even arrogent, in the way we have been living -- as if we are an invulnerable people.  And also insensitive to the poverty and challenges that others living on this planet survive with every day -- sometimes perhaps not unrelated to our persuit for a continuously improved  quality of life  or rather, materialistic way of life -- whether or not that truly provides a quailty life.  I do not believe that those who have perpetrated these crimes are just in doing so.  Still, I believe that we are naive to think that we as a society are not perpetuating the conditions that result in more extreme ways of thinking as a reaction to the poverty, ongoing conditions of war, and lack of knowledge of options.  In addition, I hear over and over again that this is the first time  we  have been attacked on our own soil.  Yet it is not.  The world trade center was bombed previously.  However, after an initial period of shock and reaction, our society returned to a state of complacency.  And after the Pan Am flight went down in the late \'80s, a committee was put together to make recommendations for increased flight security.  After the fear of that incident subsided, evidently so did the motivation for the increased flight security measures.  Once again, concern for cost and intolerance of disruption in the ease of our lives won out over the security benefits, once the fear subsided.  So is that likely to happen again.  I will suggest that if there are no more terrorists attacks on this country, once the fear subsides, the same tendacy for intolerance of increased cost and disruption will again supersede the concern for safety measures.  But perhaps this time it will take a bit longer.  I would like to think that now that we have been awakened we will not go back to sleep as a society and instead look at some of the global impacts of our actions and choices and attempt to make choices that do not merely benefit a small percentage of the planets inhabitants but instead recognize our interconnectedness on more levels.  Perhaps we can live as a less narcissistic society and more as a member of a world community.  Let\'s not go back to sleep!\"\"I believe that the individuals who committed the attacks, and their support systems are responsible for the attacks.  I also believe that it is an issue that must be dealt with globally -- one that is only exacerbated by the fact our county feels they can ignore the historic hatred that has been passed on through cultures for centuries and can ignore the poverty and conditions of war that exist in other parts of the world, as long as we are comfortable and prosperous.\"\"I am more observant of people, I spend quality time with my children.\"People who hate the USA...Because of a belief they have and to see the GREAT fall.The events of 11 Sept 01 devasted me.

I think it is time for America and the Western world to ask why this happened. I think we should take into account America\'s role in the lead up to this attack;  For more than 30 years the United States has refused to make a genuinely impartial effort to find a resolution to that conflict. It has involved itself in the Middle East in a thousand ways, but has never accepted a responsibility for dealing impartially with the two sides - locked in their shared agony and their mutual tragedy . They have themselves been carrying out acts of \'terrorism\' in the Middle East, South America, Sth East Asia, etc under the guise of \'democracy\'. We need to understand the role that capitalism has played in this and why material possessions have become more important to us than the well-being of all people? Why is it that some countries (mostly western) seem to enjoy a higher quality of life at the expense of other countries?   I think that the reporting of this event is revealing in itself for it has mostly taken  a propoganist approach using dualistic language such as  us/them , good/bad  when in fact we need to rise above these limiting definitions and realise that for humanity and the progress of the world as a whole we need to embrace diversity and difference and not feel threatened by it. I believe that for social change to occur, and it does need to, we must not commence another war, but to end the one that has been waged for too long.  I hope that something good will come out of this - a new way of thinking and of being that isn\'t founded on hatred, greed or war.  \"Because they believe in their cause and want to express this to the world.\"I think it was probably carried out by a combined nexus of Islamic groups, but given the historic events the USA et al should take some responsibility for this.\"\"I have sought out more information regarding the current subject, people involved and history etc. \"A number of terrorist radical groups probably headed by Osama bin Laden- or at least he was probably a part of it.\"It is a horrible tragedy that no one will ever forget.

I was dozing off again when I saw the 2nd plane hit.  I was shocked.  I know what I was seeing on television and I was hearing that this terrorist act this and that.  I finished dressing and went off to work.  I have to drive by downtown Los Angeles and I heard them announce on the radio to please avoid it if you could.  I saw several planes in the sky and wondered if any were meant for destruction.  I heard most of the events on the radio 102.7 here in Los Angeles.  I teach kindergarten.  Several parents took their children from the school.  I couldnt blame them, our world was falling apart.  Our security was threatened and all they wanted was to be with their children in case things got worse.  I called my best friend and we talked for a while.  I called my mom and told her I loved her and wished I could be home at the moment but my responsibilities prevented me from doing so.  I listened to the radio most of the day.  By the time, I got off work I couldnt stop the tears from flowing.  I cried all the way home.  I was so angry that these people had killed thousands without a hint of remorse.  It seemed that they did not value life and life is so precious.  I think what was even more scarier was that it could have happened to anyone.  I thought about those people who kissed their families good bye that morning and never imagined that that was their last good bye.  I thought about the people on the plane and imagined the fear that must have overwhelmed them when  they realized they were going to die.  I cried and prayed to God to please stop this from happening.  I wondered why and I cursed those people for being so evil and vicious.  I was angry at one moment and sad at the other.  I felt really low.  I read newspapers and talked to others about these events and the emotional tow was too much for me.  I felt completely numb and lost.  I felt like  I lost someone and that is not a nice feeling.  Even now when i hear stories from the survivors or people who lost loved ones, i feel this lump in my throat and I want to cry but I am determined to feel better because its not healthy and I am responsible for the well being of others and as a teacher its not helpful that children pick up in these moods. Its my job to make them feel secure and as odd as it may seem I feel secure.  I will not let these people alter my life.  I will not live it in fear or terror.  But I will live it and never take my family or friends or my life for granted again because this event reminded how fragile life can really be!\"\"Primarily those who perpetrated the attacks are to blame - violence is never the answer. However, I think we all have to shoulder some of the responsibility for our part in the system that helps turn some people to the belief that this is the only way to be heard.\"Because they are angry and disaffected. Because they believe the US is the cause of all their problems. Because they want vengeance. I have become even more active in the community of those who don\'t support the current administration response. I\'ve spent more time trying to share some of what I know about Islam and about the Middle East. I\'ve spent a lot more time trying to keep those around me calm - talking and sharing. Other than that I haven\'t changed my life to try to be more  secure  or  safe . In fact I\'m flying in a week and I\'m not at all concerned.\"I am of more than one mind about the attacks. Part of me feels like this is our chickens come home to roost. The US government supported the mujahadin, the Iraquis, and other groups back during the cold war simply because they were anti-Soviet. We didn\'t seem to care about their tactics or their politics. They could be blood-thirsty, right-wing fascists and we didn\'t care as long as they weren\'t communist. Now that theit violence is turned toward us we suddenly care. Another part of me is incredibly disappointed in humanity. I\'m disappointed that the world is still a place where some people think terrorism is their only answer.  I\'m disappointed in the responses from the political leaders in the US, particularly the President and his administration. I think they\'re doing all they can to whip the country into a war frenzy to avoid having to answer some embarrassing questions about how this happened. I also think its easier than devoting some serious thought to what they could do to really decrease terrorism and the underlying factors that cause it. I just know we\'re going to do something stupid and counter-productive that won\'t do a thing to stop terrorism and may well increase it.  Finally I\'m disppointed in the response of many of my fellow Americans who are screaming for war. They don\'t seem to have the faintest idea what they are talking about. They\'re stuck on the desire for vengence and that always scares me. Hence the wave of anti-Arab-American and anti-Muslim violence in this country that is making me so ashamed of my countrymen.\"Because they want to prove a point to america and exact revenge for some of the unfair treatment america has shown to them in the pastI soend more time reading the paper and watching the news\"I have been absolutely devestated by the terrorist events - the first day I was absolutely mesmerized to the TV watching the pics as they came in. I don\'t know anyone who has been killed in the attacks - I did know people who worked in the WTC but they all escaped okay. It wasn\'t till a day later that I actually realised the numbers of people who have been killed - I think its the  personal stories that affect the most, of men going hom to see their baby being born, the heroism aboard some of the planes etc. The pictures of the people waiting with posters of their family members hoping they will come back against all odds. I don\'t think anybody or any country deserved this type of attack - the number of innocent lives that have been taken is unbearable, although I guess others in the world can justify by the numbers of their citizens that have been killed by America. I think the US should have been better prepared for something like this - they have had plenty of warning from the arab world that something was going to happen because of their callous treatment of many in the Middle East. But I in no way condone the acts of last week. I hope the USA will take it\'s time in retaliation - I don\'t expect them to do nothing - but I think it would be tragic if more men, women and children were to be killed during the fightback.  Its at times like this I am grateful to live in a peaceful and small country, I hope that nothing like this ever happens again in my lifetime or after. \"A group from the middle east areaYeas it woke my to think more about our mortality and we should live our live to the full every day. I felt kind off scared and disturbed and the thought of world war 3 was to come did crossed my mind.  I really symphathise with the peaplo who lost their lifes and their families and friends. It woke my to think how life can be fragile and we should embrase every day we live because you never know when your time will come. I really belive that bombing Afghanistand and the civiliatns who lives there is not an solution. Rather I would see special units hunt Bin Laden and his followers and bring them to justice. Bin Laden with out a douptVery disturbed and twisted person who has no respect of the lives of innosent people.\"because they have suffered poverty, war, persecution, powerlessness for many decades.\"\"The events in America were frightening and dreadful and I have every sympathy with the people that died and their friends and family.  However, the way America and the UK has responded has made me very angry.  When something like this happens it is necessary to ask why it has happened and what have we done to deserve it.  America\'s response has been to see the disaster as aimed at \'democracy\', the \'civilised world\' and not to think that for one minute America\'s foreign policy could have brought it upon itself.  Furthermore, the perpetrators have been described as \'cowardly\' and \'terrorists\' and terms like rogue states have be banded about.  To kill oneself for a political cause does not seem like a cowardly act it seems like one which has been born out of persecution, poverty, powerlessness, frustration and anger.  The US government should ask if it has done anything to drive some people to feeling so desparate.  The terms terrorists and rogue states also need to be questionnaed.  Terrorists are usually defined as people doing dreadful things without the backing of democracy behind them.  Mandella was once a terrorist.  Now he is a hero.  The US is probably the biggest rogue state.  At present Bush and Blair are reacting like angry small town vigilanties who want revenge and want to be seen to be able to stand up to these type of people.  What the world need from its elected leaders is not knee jerk reactions but considered thoughful and reflective action.  Targetting muslims, afghanistan, the Talibhan will make Bush and the American victims feel better in the short term.  But it will end up with more deaths, more children, parents, etc being killed and both sides taking more revenge on each other.  I am not a pacifist and believe that when there is a simple enemy who can be targetted for the good of the majority than maybe awr is a good idea.  But having a war with unseen enemy (by the way the perpetrators are dead - that is the point of suicide attacks) just creates more victims and more \'terrorists\'.  We need to stay within the law, use the legal system and if states believe that killing people with planes is wrong the soltuion is not to kill more people with planes but to ask why they have done this, can we stop it from happening again and can we find enough evidence against the criminals to bring them to rial in front of a jury, try them and put them in prison.  As for Blai, I voted for him at the last election and feel as if he is betraying my vote.  To mindless say that he will stand shoulder to shoulder next to Bush, to say that we are his allies when every other European leader thinks Bush is an idiot seems like a gross case of misplaced sicophancy.  He is supposed to be a Christian and Christians are supposed to believe in forgiveness and understanding.  He seems to be of the old testament type going for revenge and an eye for an eye etc....... Overall, therefore I feel very sorry for the Americans and Brits whose lives have been ruined.  But I feel very angry with Bush and Blair for being so simplistic and unthinking / unreflexive in their response.... and now I feel much better!!!  Thank you (But I still might write to Blair anyway)\"\"The US and their foreign policy - ignoring the feelings of the rest of the world, funding Israel, funding afghanistan against the Russians.

I feel emotionally and spiritually devastated and have a desire to seek vengeance on those who could so callously target innocent civilians for mass destruction, not to mention the loss of our buildings, services and a heavy hit on our economy.  But I also realise that the greater problem is to erradicate worldwide terrorism in all of its forms and I support the president and our allies in achieving this aim in any and all ways possible.\"\"I have been much more wary about going anywhere or doing anything outside of my home and neighborhood.

There was a big scandal with truckers who were getting in accidents here in the midwest.  It turned out that they pretty much bought their licences.  And as I recall, many were middle eastern.

That everyone keeps comparing it to movies they\'ve seen brings to mind Daniel Boorstin\'s ideas on  hyperreality,  that we now compare reality to the mediated version of it. I still can\'t fathom the point the terrorists were making...how they could live so long in America and still hate Americans...how they could be willing to die to express the depth of their hate.  I am afraid for my 5 year old son and the world he will grow up in. I am afraid for all of us, because I fear this will escalate in ways we\'ve not even begun to imagine. \"Massive news-watching.The terrorists involved.Publicity for their cause.

Where was this before the brutal attack against some of our national icons?  I hope the U.S. responds appropriately and finishes what needs to be done to prevent future attacks.\"I don\'t knowPure meanness\"I don\'t think my behaviors have changed really.   I do turn on the t.v. every morning now to catch up on updates in the news.  I try not to let it bother me too much, because I think if we all live in fear, than our so called freedom has been beaten.  \"That Osama bin Ladin guy.\"The September 11th attack was something I only imagined seeing on theatre screens.  I never thought anything like that could happen.  Thinking this way makes me believe we live in a \'just\' world.  That nothing bad would ever happen to us---the Americans with so much freedom.  I remember I was at work the time it happend. I work in a big outlet mall in Katy, TX, and remember seeing the big screens hanging from the hallways of the mall which usually blare cheesy elevator music had all of a sudden switched to the live coverage of the events.  Needless to say, the biggest part of my morning was spent staining my ears to hear the sounds from inside my store, and attempting to carry on with my existance as usual.  The day was anything but ordianry.  Thousands of miles away, where I thought I wouldn\'t be directly affected by the mornings events, I realized I was being hurt by the acts of terrorism as well.  Sharply at 2pm, the mall closed down, and we all left to venture back to our homes.  As I sat glued to the t.v., no matter what channel I turned it on..it was there. Trying to find relief from the pain and suffering, I switched it to MTV, unfortunately it was covered on that channel too.  For the days to follow, my college classes met as usual, but we all sat and discussed the events.  I couldn\'t believe it actually happend.  And hearing that there were some passangers that were instructed to call their loved ones, was beyond belief.  There was like this cloud of terror and sorrow that engulfed everyone.  As much as I tried to be normal, nothing succeeded.  To know that there were people who so strongly believed in something to risk their life to kill thousands of others amazes me.  Something I can\'t quite grasp the concept of.  After a few days, all I wanted was to hear about something positive, something different, something new.  My boyfriend\'s sister had her precious baby girl on the 11th.  And it was hard to mix the feelings of sadness and sorrow with the ones that should be felt when a new human arrives in the world.  It made me think of what horrible things she will have to experience in her life.... This was a day I\'ll soon never forget.\"\"Because they see the United States and all it\'s people to be sinners...because we have freedom, because women have a place in society, because we can  drink and be merry. \"000Al Q\'aeda\"I think that it is the saddest thing that has ever happened to America. terrooorists were not just trying to make their mark, or show their strength, instead they were trying to hurt thousands of people, and cripple our economy.  I feel that this is a direct attack on America, as a whole, and everything we stand for.  I would love for the country to retaliate, and show them what we are made of, but at the same time I don\'t want innocent people killed all over again.  (because then we are down at their level)  This is an awful decision, that I wish would be made more easily, but I know that it can\'t.  I hate the thought of a war, and our innocent soldiers dying for this.  Also, Bin Laden, is the obious sick brains behind this, and I hink that he should be the one that is tortured, along with his followers.  How is America so naive, that we actually train the people to fly in our country and then we ruin our country?  How are the airports so loose, that these people get on with weapons.   It is a sad story, and I have many mixed emotions.\"Bin Laden and his followers\"I am more afraid of being out in public for some reason and I look at all different people as if thinking, you could be a terrorist and we wouldn\'t even know. \"They are sick people whoa re jealous of our country. \"I am shocked, saddened, angry, scared, in stunned disblief. I am truly frightened about how we (the US) might respond to this issue. I support a limited military engagement (I think). However, I really oppose innocent people being killed such as the soldiers we are going to send to fight in this engagement, not to mention people in Afghanistan who happen to live there. While I am not a pacifist, I do not think a pacifist approach would be the wrong one in this situation. We can act by making our airports safer, by toughening our immigration laws, and by patrolling our borders more effectively. This can help us feel in control and like  we have done something.  We don\'t have to engage in military action to  do something. \"Personally I don\'t think we have enough information to know who is responsible at this point other than they are  terrorists. \"I know they\'ll be changed when I fly.

My first thought was that it wasn\'t real.  that this couldn\'t be happening.  After all, it\'s New York City and you just can\'t crash planes into buildings!  Then it was one of realising that we were under terrorist attack and a sense of not knowing what was going to happen next.  When they shut the city down, I felt very uneasy.  I felt like a sitting duck and started to wonder if this is what the terrorists really wanted.  Did they want to shut the city down and then blow us all sky high.  I was fearful for my life.  I was evacuated the following night from my hotel in the first bomb threat at the Empire State Building because I was 2 streets from Empire State.  I\'m running down stairst not knowing if this breath was my last.  I didn\'t know if I was going to live or die and I was terrified.  I still can\'t verbalise that feeling and I don\'t think I ever will be able to.  All I can say is that I wouldn\'t wish that feeling on even my worst enemy.  I\'m fundamentally different since September 11.  I have depth of feeling now that makes me different from everyone I know back here in Australia.  It\'s isolating.  I\'ve tried to get back to some normality but it\'s very difficult.  I\'m so far away from where it happened now and that is actually making it difficult for me to recover.  I feel like the only place I belong right now is New York.  Nothing else feels right.  I\'m trying to continue on with my studies because I refuse to let this beat me.  I\'m returning to New York on December 26 to study for 6 months and I\'ve never been more focused or determined to do anything in my life.  These terrorists will not beat me.  But people here just don\'t understand the position I\'m coming from.  They think I\'m crazy for wanting to fly back and be in the city where it happened.  To me, it\'s the only sane thing for me to do.  I, like everyone else who lived through this horror, need to make peace with it in my heart before I can even hope to try and have some sort of  normality  in my life.\"\"Very angry, very emotional.

I\'m sorry that all those people lost their lives and pray daily for the families remaining which has to be almost intolerable.  But I think the way that America has come together; the way other countries of the world including our enemies are supporting us is just \'out of this world.\'  This terrible tragedy may be the best thing that has ever happened to the United States, notwithstanding that people here have suffered much.

I was in dismay to see the first tower had been struck and wondered if there was an accident or if someone had chosen a horrible way to commit suicide.  THe thought of terrorism was remote.  I watched live on MSNBC as the second plane swooped behind the first tower, and my whole body convulsed in a second as I knew instantly it was terrorism--all while the commentators had not yet noticed.  It was eerie to feel so alone in that moment of knowing.  So, scared and horrified, I continued to watch.  At some point I realized that my father had been scheduled to fly into Boston that day.  WIth shaking hands, I turned on my computer to find the email he\'d sent of his itenerary.  Thankfully, he had send a message saying he had not gotten on his plane as a result of the attacks.  I then called everyone else I knew would be worried about me or about whom I was worried.  My mother\'s step-daughter works in Manhattan, my ex-husband travels sometimes to the Pentagon.  Everyone was ok.  Then I watched some more.  After the second tower toppled I finally broke down in uncontrollable sobbing.  After several minutes, my doorbell rang--I jumped.  I went to the door and it was a man from the water company.  I opened the door and said  Can I help you?   He said he was there from the water company...I was dazed and said  Well, what is it you need to do? .  He looked at me quizzically and replied  You called us.   I had completely forgotten that I had set up the appointment--and I am usually so aware of meetings and appointments, etc.  So, he took a look at my plumbing problems while we watched together.  The rest of it is a blur, except for the emotion.  I feel sadness, emptiness, worry about my world.  I feel no sense of wanting revenge, only justice--unlike many people I know.  I\'ve had many arguments with friends and family over what we think could and should be done, and why.  For the first time in my life, I wanted to buy a flag--but couldn\'t find any.  I have always been patriotic and usually weep to hear the national anthem or America the Beautiful, but I felt a need to display my feelings.  I am afriad sometimes that I won\'t be affected deeply enough by all of this, that I could return to my (questionably false) sense of security.  I want to help.  I gave some money, I volunteered to serve on a panel discussion, I plan to go through clothes to donate.  I feel pretty helpless, though.  I worry about the economy--but I\'ve tried to keep my worry from changing my spending habits in the hopes that others do the same and consumer confidence doesn\'t become unrecoverable.  I kept all my money where it was invested before the attacks.  I miss my family now more than ever and have made more plans to see them, although to do so I must fly--which scares me.  I\'m finally starting to feel a lifting of the depression, but I\'m torn, and wonder if I should still feel depressed.  It is simply confusing times.  Thanks for the chance to express my feelings and experiences.\"\"Not much on a daily basis.  I have watched more news.  I have spent more time with loved ones.  I have given more money.  I have thought about the meaning of life, love, democracy and freedom. I have been much more likely to cry over seemingly trivial things.\"\"Ultimately, the terrorists.  But, I do think that the world political and economic conditions contributed, including the actions and stances taken by the U.S.  Just like a victim of rape is not responsible, it may be prudent to understand if any of the victim\'s actions were involved.   We might be able to change behavior in such a way that alters the likelihood of another attack, or more importantly, the motivation for another attack.  On the other hand, just like a rape victim could avoid another rape by staying in her house for the rest of her life, there are measures we should not take (such as supporting the opposition to the terrorists at all costs).\"\"Many ways to look at this question...anger, religious extremism, individuals who are susceptible to co',5,-5,0,2,5,0,6.7,0,0,0,0,0,4.31,1.92,0,1.44,0,14.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,0.96,0,0.96,12.45,1.92,0,0,8.62,0,0,0,1.44,0,0.96,0.96,0,47.9,0,2.39,0,0,0,0.96,1.92,0,60.36,6.7,0,13.41,0,0.96,0,0,0,1.92,0,0.96,0,0,0,7.67,12.46,2.87,0,0,0,4.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,0,Female
'United states past history of international affairs. Not Completely innocent at all.\"I think that this act of terrorism is really going to have some negative effects world wide.  I am not scared of the terrorists trayectory whatever that may be, what scares me is the reaction of the United States.  I think the president is advocating vengeance which will only further harm innocent lives as those that were killed on Septemember 11.  I think the president should think more profoundly about his actions and not act on impulse as it seems he is doing.  \"Not because U.S. is a democracy as the president says so that is for sure.  I think the U.S. has not been the most innocent or heroic in all aspects in their international or foreign affairs.I am simply more critical and trying to become more aware of government policy .\"Besides being less reticent about showing my patriotism or my love for friends and family, not much yet because I have not needed to travel.\"\"I only know what I read, but it seems to be Osama bin Laden and many others.\"\"Like everyone, I am still shocked, numbed, and saddened.  Even more than the immediate horrendous loss of life and property, I am deeply worried about the after-shocks.  There are too many worrisome areas to go into, but one that I am currently most concerned about is one of my own children, whose best friend was murdered three months ago.  This has brought the trauma roaring back for her when I had thought/hoped she was healing. I worry about the economy; I worry about a war.  But part of me has hope that this might be the thing that shakes us and other nations out of our sometimes selfish complacency and causes us to work together more productively than we have in decades toward peace.  We are seeing signs of decent people feeling this way around the world.  It is moments like this when progress can be made that might have been impossible otherwise.  We need help from the international community, religious and political, to turn this evil-doer over to justice.  We all need to hold hands and say that we will not look at the face of despair and assume that it is inevitable.\"\"Some people are evil, and enjoy causing terror and destruction.  To the extent they have an agenda, it is in the creation of chaos.  It is the ultimate power trip.  There can\'t be a specific, defined political agenda.  This goes way beyond that.\"Usama Bin Laden and his followers.\"More Patriotic, More Proud, More aware of my surrounds and More thankful for the freedoms I have taken for granted!  I also have more faith in God than ever.  I KNOW God has a plan, even if I don\'t understand it.  I am trying to keep praying for patience, understanding, brotherly love, forgiveness and salvation.   Your Brothers Keeper  has a new, deeper meaning to me.  We ARE our Brothers Keepers.  As Americans we need to take care and love one another.  Stand Tall and Stand Proud.  United We Stand, Divided We Fall!!!!  So, United, we shall Be!!!  \"\"I was totally in shock.  I could not believe that someone would/could so something as horrific as this.  I watched as the second plane almost speared through the second tower.  I just sat in disbelief.  I then heard about the pentagon.  My first thought was  What is happening to this world? , then  How could someone be filled with so much hate for us, that would cause them to do such a thing to so many innocent people?   I went to work, glued to the television at any available moment.  I looked around the room and found it amazing that everyone seemed to be hypnotized by that little black box called the television.  I watched as no one spoke, but sat in silence in unison, with tear-filled eyes.  Everyone was coming together.  There no longer was Black, White, Asian, Spanish........we were Americans.  That was our bond.  That was the glue that held us all together.  Later that day, still in shock, I thought of how easy it was for me (and many others) to watch as other countries were bombed, butchered and left for dead.........say,  That is horrible.   Switch the channel and go on about my everyday business.  It truly WAS horrible.  I feel so guilty that it took it happening in MY country for me to really feel the abomination!  I guess I agree with Kevin Richardson, when he said,  We are a bit of an arrogant nation, and maybe this is a little bit of humbling experience.   I guess I thought we were ABOVE any of that.  I thought that things like that didn\'t happen HERE!  Well, I was wrong.  I am deeply saddened to have to say that, but I was wrong.  Someone said it very accurately when they said,  They aimed for America......they missed!  America isn\'t the ground, America isn\'t the cities......AMERICA IS THE PEOPLE!  Please forgive me for being so arrogant as to think this couldn\'t happen to us.  I love God, I love my family and I love my Country.  Although this horrible, unimaginable thing has happened to us, I pray that I don\'t let it cause me to hate.  I pray for the evil people that have done this to my country.  I think how horrible their lives must be for them to not KNOW the love of God.  Anyone who could do something like this in the name of God, clearly, doesn\'t know God! \"\"Jealously, and the belief that we (America) are the root of all evil.\"\"I\'ve already responded--nearly 2 wks ago?  But I wanted to write again.  I kept thinking the events of 9/11 would decrease in emotional intensity if not day by day, at least week by week.  But I read the obits of people in the NY Times, or hear stuff about the dead and missing on the radio, and I start to tear up. I\'m starting to tear up as I write this.  That\'s the worst part for me. I understand (emotionally understand, if there is such a thing) that a lot of people died.  Young people.  Thousands? I can\'t imagine thousands.  My neighbors (I live in a NYC apt--Manhattan) are talking about leaving the city.  They\'re in their early 40s, childless.  They have family upstate, and I guess they\'ll go.  It\'s a good time to sell NYC real estate.  I think we\'re dividing into two camps now: those who want to leave NYC and those who wouldn\'t consider leaving.  I\'m in the latter camp.  Now that Rudy Guiliani has announced his greedy desire to stay on as mayor, I\'m feeling that things are returning a bit to normal.  Rudy has been terrific during this whole aftermath, but he\'s got a huge ego, he\'s an arrogant jerk, and now that his jerk-ness is resurfacing, I\'m feeling that things ARE returning to normal.  My students (college freshman) do NOT want to talk or write about this.  Tell us happy stuff,  the noisy ones insist.  I don\'t know why they\'re so resistant.  I want to keep talking.  I went to a wedding today--at my table people were from Hong Kong, New Jersey, Chicago, and two who moved this week to Manhattan. I brought up Rudy, and the events.  They didn\'t want to talk much. But I guess at a wedding is not the time.  I\'m willing to talk about just about anything at just about any time.  I keep combing the web for new stuff. I found a magnificent site sponsored by AIGA (american institute of Graphic artists) who submitted ART in response to the attacks.  Great stuff.  Definitely the worth a thousand words variety. (http://www.aiga.com/content.cfm?ContentAlias=911gallery)...I just went on a search for that url, and my need to write subsided.  I started this because I had a need to write more.  I suspect that as the time passes and people are less interested in having conversations about 911, then writing will be even more important.\"\"jealousy, need to show power, need for attention, machismo, spite, sour grapes, need to  do the right thing  for the higher-ups, lack of self esteem that lets the terrorists become, for that moment,  big --ironic that they don\'t know (they=the ones who died) have successful they were.  I guess they thought they\'d knock the towers over, though, and they would\'ve killed a lot more that way--everyone in the bldgs plus people and bldgs in the path.  The  why  that\'s answered by  they\'re crazy  is not an option.  If someone\'s crazy, does he/she do something for a reason? Well, maybe.  Son of Sam said his dog told him to kill.  I don\'t understand why someone would do this, really.  My fantasies don\'t lie in this area. I can\'t related.  (Is it because I\'m female??)\"I don\'t sleep well. Some days I\'m irritable.  I feel more vulnerable emotionally--I\'ve always had trouble letting myself be vulnerable.\"there are a few ways to look at this--directly, it\'s probably Bin Laden. Indirectly it\'s everyone: the US, the Middle East Terrorist groups, and who knows who else.\"\"An extremist.  An externalizer.  I can\'t believe there is a nation complicit in this action, so I attribute it to individuals.  Ethnicity and nationality and religion become irrelevant.\"Who knows?  To point out our vulnerability.  To highlight to the rest of the world our arrogance and superiority.\"I have been more honest in my discourse with others.  I am more attentive to people I meet, no matter who they are in relation to me. More considerate.\"\"It remains incomprehensible to me that anyone would plan so destructive an attack so meticulously, given the anticipated  collateral  damage.  What could be gained by this? Is there anyone who believes that such a limited attack (e.g., no nuclear bombs, no biological weapons) could defeat us, spiritually or tangibly?  Was the only purpose of the attack an attempt to show us that it could be done?  That we are vulnerable?   On a more personal level, I have a lot of guilt over my overinvolvement in my own life at this time. I have been extremely depressed in response to the recent breakup of an illicit affair, over which I continue to carry significant guilt.  My current partner is crochety and sick most of the time, but  threatens to kill herself if I leave, so I\'m stuck.  My best friend and mentor has pancreatic cancer.  It\'s where I\'ve been in my head - obsessively ruminating on my own concerns, which, if examined, appear petty in comparison to last Tuesday\'s events.  But there they are, nonetheless.  And, of course, I feel much worse about them in light of the pall that\'s dropped - more depressed, more helpless, more hopeless,  more unattractive, more guilty about my concerns about my level of attractiveness.  For these reasons and the events of the 11th, I was absolutely struck inactive last week.  Initially, I did my job by passing out information on how to begin to cope with this, how to deal with children, checking on patients and staff about their feelings.  But, when I was done making rounds, I also noticed that I had no energy to do the  simplest of tasks.  I had a hole in my stomach; my throat was tight; I was tremendously fatigued.  My desk looks like I\'m a pack rat. On the other hand, I feel a greater connection with the people I work with and do business with on a daily basis - nurses, clerks, receptionists, checkout people.  I\'ve stopped to ask how they are.  I\'ve prayed more.  I\'ve asked myself what\'s important (although I haven\'t come up with an answer).  I spend more time thinking about and talking to my family (current partner excepted).  I\'ve been more vulnerable to friends, finally accepting a shoulder to cry on after months of declining spirits as my former lover approaches his wedding day.   I have dreams, of course.  Mostly, I dream of watching from above as people jump out of windows.  I wake terrified. I feel guilty.  I feel despair.  I feel vulnerable.  But I am inspired by the efforts of others.  \"Beats me. Jealousy? Perhaps the misguided belief that they will go to heaven and martyred by taking out/killing  non believers. \"A group of radical, religious fanatics who believe they can take down the strongest country of the world simply by killing some of us. How wrong they are! I don\'t know if they are related to the Bin Laden terrorist group (Al Qyada) but I have a feeling that they are all united in their hatred of the American way of life. They are most likely from a group of Arab/Muslim countries.\"\"I am very cautious about where I go and prefer to not go out alone. I don\'t intend to fly any time soon because I fear for our safety and I don\'t want to go to any events with large groups of people. I am trying hard not to look at my neighbors and those in my community with darker skin skeptically or with doubt, but I have to be honest, if I saw a group of Arab men getting on my airplane right now, I wouldn\'t fly. I hate to admit it. \"\"I watched NBC\'s Today Show in horror and disbelief last Tuesday morning. I had a hard time processing everything that was happening. I simply couldn\'t believe that anyone could do something like that on purpose. My first thoughts went out to friends I knew who worked in the WTC and at the Pentagon, and then I quickly began contacting my family members who are spread out all across the country. I found out that all three of my brothers were on scheduled flights that morning. One brother took off out of LAX but his fight was quickly returned to LA when all of this started going down. The other two were stranded for days and couldn\'t get home. I thank God every moment that they weren\'t on those fated planes. It seems that everyone I know has been touched by these cowardly hijackers personally. Either they have lost someone close to them or know someone who has. Feeling completely helpless but wanting to do something, my boyfriend and I went out at lunch time last Tuesday to give blood at our local blood bank. We found out later that our blood was flown to Washington, D.C., so I hope that it was of some use. That evening, a deep, profound sadness came over me and lingered until about last Sunday. I couldn\'t stop crying for days. I didn\'t want to eat, I couldn\'t sleep and I had trouble focusing on work. I went to several memorial masses at my church, and by Sunday I think I had finally gotten a little perspective and some peace in my heart. I feel that I have been altered and will never be the same. I have a strong feeling of patriotism and pride in my country, however, I still have a feeling of dread about the long, drawn-out war that seems inevitable to occur. I am afraid to fly and really don\'t want to go any place where a large group of people is assembled (i.e., Disney, NFL or College football game, the mall, etc.). I am currently unemployed (struggling to start my own business) and my spending has been curtailed even further since the attack. I believe we are truly in an economic recession and I have zero consumer confidence at this time. I have dedicated my life and my belief system to peace, yet I feel that our country must make a strong response to these acts of terror. I have never been in favor of war but I am supportive of Bush and our government\'s actions so far. And me, a staunch liberal democrat! It seems like it was years ago that I was protesting against Bush  stealing the election.  Oh how times have changed! I think it is imperative for our country to get as many allies around the world to join us in this fight so that terrorists will know that they are not welcome in any land. I truly hope that any conflict will end quickly and with as little death and destruction as possible but I fear this is just a pipedream. I have a problem with destroying Afganistan just to find Bin Laden. The Afgani people have suffered so much for so long and this is the last thing they need, but something needs to be done. I also fear for the lives of Arab-Americans. I hope that we as a people have learned from our racism in World War II with Japanese-Americans, but I fear that some will take out their anger and aggression on these people. I hope not -- that would only be sinking to the level of atrocities committed by these terrorists! That is not what America stands for and I don\'t want to live in a world of fear, racism and hatred. Well, I\'ve written a book so I guess I should end this... Good luck with your research!  \"I am more aware of things. Osama Ben Laden\"there is no reason someone would do this. However, we are the enemy as we do not think or believe the same way he and his followeres do, therefor that is their reason.\"\"I was, and still am, in shock. I want to wake up and have it all be a horrible dream. Then, I realize I am awake. I am angry, but at who? Ben Laden is the first name I think of, but the afgan people will suffer more than he will. I am so sad, the lost of life was terrible. I am afraid, not deeply afraid and unable to go out, but araid and constantly aware of my surroundings. I don\'t know what we should od, but we should do something!\"0hatred of US politics and US foreign policygone to church more; looking for ways to show my support and patriotismunknown\"I think bin Laden was most likely behind it, but that is it more involved.  The politics of the Middle East is something that I have only recently been reading about.  There is a possibility that Iran is ultimately behind this or perhaps another country and is using bin Laden as the front man.  I don\'t know, though.\"\"As I said previously, I know look for the Sears Tower to see if another attack has been waged.  I am scared.  I am sad.  I watch the news as frequetly as possible.  I just want to know what is happening.  I talk to friends more, but am more combative and unnerved.  There are many changes that I don\'t even think I\'ve recognized yet as well.\"\"That is a hard question.  My thoughts vary sometimes from minute to minute right now.  It is a week today from the devastation, and it is still very salient for me.  I am concerned about the repercussions that this event will have, I still think about the people who were involved both as terrorists and as victims.  I can\'t erase the pictures of people jumping from the window, the plane colliding, or the thousands of people who are wandering NY with missing signs like ghosts or nomads, just wanting some information or closure.  I have found myself looking at the Sears Tower wondering if that will be next and if not, what?  Will it be Union Station?  Chemical warfare?  Biological warfare?  There is a pervasive melancholy and I am angry that my life in some respects has been put in jeopardy but people that I really didn\'t even know much about two weeks ago.  I don\'t want a war on our soil and I don\'t want to die.  I have been feeling so atypically patriotic and even bought a flag.  Tears well up when patriotic songs are played and I sometimes can cry with the number of truly good people are out there, helping and doing what they can to assist.  I feel sometimes that I am just being melodramatic and then I read more reports from national and international newspapers and realize that either we are all melodramatic or this is a very serious war that we have engaged ourselves in.  I try to figure out how things will change exactly.  I have also been trying to grapple with my own reaction and balancing my own horror and mourning with the need to move on with jobs, relationships, life.  It has been hard and I realize that if we invade many innocent people will be killed, and I do not want that, but I do not want my brother, mother, husband, friends killed either and it seems that this is what is has come to.  I am sure if this question was asked just a month from now our reactions would be much different, at least mine would.  I suppose only time will tell at this point.\"\"Hatred of America, desire to spread Muslim as a religion, and many other factors.\"\"Much more sad, quiet, teary eyed, short tempered, I feel as though my antennae are ultra sensitized and it hurts.  Yes, I\'m going to counseling soon. Thank you.\"\"Hate, political ambitions, feeling they have no other choices.  I believe belonging to SOMETHING to some people might feel better that quiet desparation.\"\"My entire world feels changed.  I worry so for my grown children, I worry so for my little grandchildren.  Everything seems upside down and inside out.  The attacks on September 11th have left me feeling so vulnerable, so out of control, so helpless in many ways.  I will dive back into counseling to help me feel better - but in the meantime I read all of the mental health suggestions - connecting with friends, exercise, journaling and the rest.  But I ALWAYS have done these things and still, late at night, the fright swells up.  And just when I feel I am on the path to mourning (I do not know anyone directly involved), another news report, another anthrax, more bombing of innocents in Afghanistan, more hunger, more fear, more death. I understand America is not without blame - I love my country, but at times not my government.  And to hear the simplistic rhetoric from supposed educated people in government is incredulous!  We\'re dropping peanut butter sandwiches to people who don\'t even know what it is, in the same yellow colored packages that cluster bomb parts come in!  My Dear Lord, who IS in charge here?  Be extra alert, but go about our regular business . . . . .and the list goes on.  Ellen Goodman\'s columns have spoken about how I feel . . . . .nothing feels secure.  Sort of like walking on earthquake damaged ground, everything is shifting.  And the TREMENDOUS amount of unemployment, pain and hurt.  And the horror all of the children of those killed.  Where will it all end - if at all?!\"\"Hate, political ambitions, and total alienation from all that is good.

'\"The disaster of Sept. 11, 2001 was one of the greatest shocks and heartbreaks of my life.  I find myself crying about what happened even now.  I did not lose anyone in the disaster but it was a great loss to humanity.  The loss of life, and the lowering of the whatever humanity could have existed in the imbalanced people responsible.  My fear for my children is a prevailing emotion.  Always over cautious, I am a nervous wreck.  I lost someone who I cared so deeply about because I was such an emotional mess over this.  My oldest son is on a destroyer in the Persian Gulf right now.  I have a child 40 miles away and another in a combat zone.  I pray to God that we have the strength to get through this.  I pray for the families and for the victims.  \"drink alcohol more.  More stressed out.  Have emotional high and lows.  Pray more.  Try to be kinder to people.Bin LadenInsane\"America changed from September 11, 2001 foward.  My life the way I know it will never be the same.  America should attack any and all terrorists with full force.  We need to take a stand and show the world that we will not stand for terrorism on our soil.  I think our appearance to the world at this point has been a helping hand.  We get involved in settling disputes with other countries, and now we need to show our anger over what happened.  My thoughts and prayers have been with the people who lost friends and family in the tragedy.  God Bless America!\"Too many ways to describe.False hopes of grandure.Various people and countries.I feel closer to my family and show a lot more respect to those around me. I feel that it is true that we are all in this together and there should be no hate between any race.I feel that these events that happened on September 11 are very sad. I think that it so horrible that people would use humans for terrorist attacks. I feel that these events have brought our country closer to eachother. We are americans and we will stand by our country forever. I think that crime rates have gone down since this happened and people live life to the fullest everyday.Bin Laden and his whole countryTo be evil and not have any kind of feeling for othersThe only thing that has changed is that I am not buying as much. My resources are more limited since my husband is on active duty. Osmar Bin Louden\"My first response was sadness. There were so many people who died senselessly. I knew instantly that my husband would be called to active duty once again and that it would not be a short tour. The news reporters are telling to much information to the public. Some of the information could put our troops in danger. We need to consider our troops safety first and the publics need to know what is going on last. We really don\'t need to know what is planned, but what has already happened. \"He wants to decrease USA\'s involvement in his country\'s politics.

After the initial shock wore off, I cried all the time from about Wednesday to Saturday--I felt as if I would never stop crying. We  had a few loose connections to people who were lost in the attack, and I couldn\'t stop thinking about their families. Every time I read more stories about victims in the paper, I cried some more. I was and am surprised by the extent of my reaction--I feel as if somebody in my family dies, even though no one did. Just this weekend I am finally starting to feel that the event is becoming past-tense, rather than a current nightmare--I feel like I have pretty well comprehended the extent of the tragedy, and I am no longer shocked by each new story of a victim or survivor. But these stories, or news articles about the funerals in my community, etc. can still bring tears to my eyes. I am surprised I have felt very little anger, mostly just grief.\"Profound hate for the US and its actions/interventions abroad\"I truly wonder if it would have gone this far if Clinton was in office.  I wonder if Clinton would have reacted differently to bin Laden\'s warnings, maybe at least meeting with him to try to negotiate some sort of peace.  I realize that in Holy War conditions, negotiation is almost impossible, but I just wonder, that\'s all.\"I feel a little more at ease with terrorism and its direct affect on me because I am close to my family and friends and that is all that matters.I don\'t think this is a Holy War.  I think it is more to it- perhaps money.I beleive there is a lot the government isn\'t telling us. \"He is truly mean. He hates America and everything that we stand for. Instead of attacking the military, he went after the innocent citizens. They are the ones that enjoyed the everyday right we have of freedom. He is a horrible person. \"\"I am scared to fly, when normally I fly a lot. I am trying not to let this fear take over my life, because then they will win. I am constantly aware now that America is not immune to this sort of attack. \"\"Our country is going through an awful tragedy that was caused by terrorists who hate Americans. So many innocent lives were stolen, so many families are mourning the loss of their loved ones. Anyone could have been on those planes or in the World Trade Center twin towers, you or me. These terrible people are going to pay for taking our citizens and making us feel unsafe in our own homes and offices. The hijackers were willing to kill themselves in order to attack America. Those passengers on the plane that crashed in Somerset County, PA knew they were going to die anyway, so they expressed some real heroism and perhaps saved hundreds more lives.  So much has happened to our country this last week and a half, I find it hard to organize my thoughts. While I did not lose anyone close to me, I am mourning with the rest of the country. I like many others were worried that some of my closest friends were in or near the World Trade Centers when these attacks happened, but fortunately they were not.  I am very scared about what is next. I am scared of war, I am scared of more attacks, I am scared to fly. But if I let these fears rule my life, these terrorists have won. I will not let them win. I am flying this weekend to see my family and plan my wedding for next August. I will not let them win. We will not let them win. I love America and I am proud of the citizens that are uniting. We are a tough country and freedom will prevail.  \"Bin Ladenbecause they think differently than we do.  they are irrational. they believe in murder in the name of god. i really do not know. it is IMPOSSIBLE to fathom why anyone would or could ever do something this despicable.\"we all are. immediately, it is the person/people responsible for flying the planes. but the world has let hatred and terrorism lead to this...\"\"deepest thoughts and feelings....                       FEAR FEAR FEAR and anger because i know that is what they want us to feel. anger at irrationality and how i see their irrationality reflected in america with the extreme violence suggested we employ in revenge. i feel an insecurity  i never thought i would feel in my own country. every time i hear an airplane fly over, i shudder.  i feel an immense sadness for the people that were unfortunate enough to be in that area on that day (that were killed). i feel an even greater sadness for their friends and family that survived but must live with the thought of their loved one slowly rotting away under heaps of rubble, or burning in an intense explosion powered by hate. i feel confusion at the state of our world. will we never be happy with what we have and what we have become? why must we always be angry at someone, always be waging war against someone? maybe we should not be so ethnocentric, maybe we should not be so egocentric as to think that we are superior to others...other anythings. other religions, races, countries, ideas... i feel apprehension about the future. how long can we survive amidst hatred like this? with the weapons and knowledge that we have today, and with our intolerance (yes, it continues!) of those who are different from ourselves, we seemed doomed for despair, and in a very short amount of time. where are our freedoms headed? in order to protect ourselves, we have to give them up. can we ever feel safe and secure without a sense of freedom? i ask you, is that possible? the world is never going to be the same. i wish it had never happened. i wish we could understand each other. i wish we could get along. i wish i did not have to worry about opening my mail for fear of deadly bacteria. but, this is the world we live in, the best of all possible worlds (oh really) ....and that in itself is a scary thought.\"\"i am a lot more fearful, cautious. i cannot sit through the news, but i watch all of the presidential addresses. i read updates on the internet. i cower at the thought of flying on a plane, something i previously loved to do. \"I personally do not know.  I feel that they are a lot of people that could do this.They haven\'t because I always live for the day.Just out of plain envy and anger.\"The events on September 11th were very shocking.  I feel that they are an awakening to our country to let them know that they are still be people that envy what we have.  It has allowed us to put up our guards, but it is a shame that we had to loose so many lives.\"\"Compassion for the victims of this event but also for those who suffer worldwide. Fear and anxiety - what might happen next, what other terrorist acts might have been concealed by our government in the past and/or passed off as accidents, worry that desire for revenge will dominate and drag us into an ill-conceived military effort (I have a draft-age son). Concern about justice issues - we are appalled at images of Palestinians celebrating, but no one asks whether we\'ve been guilty of celebrating acts we\'ve perpetrated against others, or why people in these other countries feel the way we do, whether they have a justified grievance - I would have hoped that as a nation we would do more soul-searching about why we are hated and resented so much in some quarters and what if anything we might do about it if we understood. Also I\'d wish this event brought us to empathize more with people the world over who have not had the American luxury of physical and economic security, and wish to do more to address their suffering now that we feel it, too.\"I suppose it is likely that the al-Qaid network is responsible as alleged.\"I checked my car for bombs as taught to do when I lived in Europe 15 years ago. I didn\'t take a commuter train to work because of (irrational) fear of an incident. I\'m more grateful for the safety and prosperity I enjoy as an American, and more proud of my country as an example of what a free and prosperous life can be like, more aware of this iconic value for people everywhere. I pay more attention to my kids. I watch the news more. I am appreciating simple things more and spending less.\"\"How else can a group with a grievance against a disproportionately powerful perceived foe seek redress? And, in a country that claims to be governed by the people, and in which many of the acts of Western culture are carried out by corporations, why should the people expect that retribution should come only against our military? We can\'t evade individual responsibility for our country\'s and our corporations\' acts.\"',4,-5,0,2,5,0.92,4.14,0,0.92,0,0,0,2.76,0,0,1.38,0,13.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.52,2.76,0,1.38,6.9,3.68,0,0,12.42,0,0,0,0.46,0.92,0,3.22,0,64.86,0,0.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,75.9,4.6,0,9.66,0,0,0,0,0,3.68,0,0.92,0,0,0,24.84,11.04,3.68,0,0,0,10.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.76,Female
'The human race.I\'m more conscious of the choices I make in my life and the meaning of those choices.Fear and Hate\"I believe that the tragedy that occurred, in its simplest form is truly a matter of light forces vs. dark forces, good vs. evil. Just as in our individual lives, there are matters that require our attention for the sake of our happiness and evolution (in the truest sense of the word - Authentic happiness). These matters are love, peace, unity, freedom, justice, truth and the like.  I believe this tragedy occurred because the human race was not paying attention to what is deeply, profoundly, eternally important in their lives  -   Peace, Love, Freedom, Unity and the like.  Prior events (injustices, discrimin ation, dissnesion, etc.) have been wake-up calls for us to listen to, but we didn\'t. Because we chose to be ignorant, an event of greater magnitude occurred so that  we could not ignore the enormity. Now we\'ll pay attention. Whenever there is destruction, there also is creation. We now have the opportunity to create a very different world than we\'ve experienced before.  Watch miracles happen...watch how the best is brought out in the human race.  Look at the change in perception, the unity - dems and repubs unified; a need is expressed e.g. as supplies, blood, volunteers and there\'s an abundance; tv stations, cable stations and radio stations simultaneously broadcasting a telethon; worldwide unity for support to stop the spread of terrorism...and on and on look at how the rescue workers and health care practicioners risked their own lives for the sake of saving others. I have faith and confidence in the inherent goodness of the human race. This will make for a better world, a better life for our children.  I hope we learn that it\'s no longer necessary for tragedies to bring to our attention, those matters that should have been valued and protected before. It\'s better to learn and grow in peace and joy, than it is to learn through pain and suffering. I believe this is within our free will.\"Osama Bin Ladenvengeance for an unjustice they feel we caused themthey have not changed\"Today, more than two weeks after the event, I would have to say my primary feeling about September 11 is grief.  So many innocent people died; so many more are presently in anguish over lost loved ones; why did this have to happen?  It saddens me to think that the evil in our world is so potent that it could cause this much destruction and depair.  Are we all capable of such evil?  How can we stop it?   \"Envy of freedom\"The tragedy that occured on September 11, 2001 has touched everyone around the world in more ways than one.  I feel terrible about this situation and my prayers go to all those who have been directly involved in this tragedy.   We have lost many people and yet New York has become more united than ever.  The most astonishing thing that came out of this whole event is that everyone has come together to help one another.  I have been attending several vigil lightings for this country as a way to cope with what has occured. What I can not understand is that freedom is something that should be admired and taken advantage of and not believing in freedom is just depriving yourself from having and being so much more than you can possibly have/be. I also get nervous about the next \'move\'.  I am strongly against wars, yet I believe that those behind this disaster should pay for what they have done.   Many may say that it is a tragedy and I do not disagree with that  but in a way I feel that they have done us a favor.  These terroist have brought this country together.  We have volunteers of all kinds helping many that are in need and we have thousands of people who are willing to donate blood for strangers.  This event is something that I will never forget and will always remember when I feel that I can not overcome. I know that President Bush will take the best decisions to bring justice to America!   GOD BLESS AMERICA             \"I don\'t take advantage of people around me because anything can happen to me0\"As one who is dedicated to SELF KNOWLEDGE and who trusts in the wisdom of the DIVINE I found the events to be shattering and very profound yet ultimately uplifting - let me explain. I live in NYC though I only know of people who were directly affected, most closely my husband who watched from his office. I heard the plane and the crash my husband called and told me what had happened so I watched it all on TV - NYU buildings blocked my view of all but the smoke. My heart was rending for the people struck in the terrible gash. I prayed constantly for them and for those trapped in the higher floors. I talked to them and told them to go to the light. I have prayed and cried constantly for them even though I know none of them. I felt the crumbling of those two towers as an event in my own inner being - a crashing right down through my toes and the result is that my own heart is completely broken. I feel immense love and concern for all those directly affected for all those in my immediate sphere and for everyone I see in this great city. I never want this heart to be reconstructed. What broke was a shell, a protection that ultimately kept me from experiencing and sharing my own deep love of all of humanity. Beneath the inner destruction I recognized a steadiness and power that cried freely and openly. My sense is those tears were cleansing and reached far beyond my own self. Lately I see those who have died as having offered us a tremendous gift of love. They have died in an event that has drawn all the eyes of the world sharply into focus over terrible injustices.  I feel no anger or blame toward any of the perpetrators of this crime. I see them as victims too. I feel a terrible sorrow in my heart for those who feel that this is their only recourse. It saddens me that they are convinced that there can be no heaven on this earth for them and that their only choice is to die. Every single life is precious and cosmic in scope and intimately connected to every other life. All about me there are deep and concerned discussions about the cause of this kind of cruel venture and the reasons for such hatred directed to our country. We are very good at noble ideals and sharing but not so deep below the surface we are guilty of all sorts of major and minor inhumanities. I have seen and recognized some and done nothing. I felt I was just one little person and powerless to change the tide of understanding of corporate globalization and the press of Western ideals on everyone, welcome or not. I am perplexed by our countries position on land mines and international child welfare.  Another gift of the ones who gave their lives at the WTC is that I am now totally motivated. It is my intention to work in any way I can to enlighten our mutual understanding of our intimate dependence on one another.  I cannot enjoy my own luxurious lifestyle while I know others are starving or being forced to live as slaves or being deluded into fruitless suicide missions. I don\'t know what to do but I know I will do something.  I thank you for this study it is my belief that all we all need is to be acknowledged and heard. All manner of ills can be diffused if we listen carefully.\"I am trying very hard to be sweeter to everyone. It is hard and I unfortunately fail occasionally. I am motivated to work harder to improve understanding and I am actively reorganizing my career choices.\"I have no idea. I only hope that all of the media and government statements are correct and that they can prove direct culpability. However, when we trace the history back further I wonder how responsible we are ourselves for creating, empowering and motivating such an act. Why don\'t we teach these rebels, diplomacy and other skills of civilazation instead of warrior skills? \"They are desperate and see no way out. They have convinced themselves that they are right. Although I wonder how far the resources and brilliance in perpetrating this act would go if they addressed improving their lifestyle in their own sphere.\"I moved to Seattle, Washington from New York City almost three months ago.  Having lived in NYC for 15 years, the Sept. 11th event really hit home for me in a deep way.  Felt like the rug was pulled out from under me, leaving me to stand on shaky ground.  On the 11th, I first heard news of the attack at 8:00 Pacfic time from my son\'s teacher.  I was in shock, I didn\'t know how to respond, felt numb and disoriented.  After leaving the school, I called my sister who lives here in Seattle as well to ask her for more detail of the event.  As I found out more about it, I feared for my two friend\'s lives who both worked a few blocks away from the WTC.  I couldn\'t concentrate.  I actually had two job interviews that morning and only made it to one of them.  On my way home, I couldn\'t look at anyone, just the ground and I was trembling.  When I turned on the TV and saw the towers crumbling, I was screaming from inside my being.  Were my friends okay?  Were they dead?  I sat glued to the TV, tears just streaming down my face in disbelief.  Those beautiful buildings were destroyed.  I\'ll never see them again.  All those people dead instantly, how many people died?  It was as if a part of me had died.  I even worked in the WTC when I first moved to NYC.  Were those people still working there, were they okay?  Thoughts of the people and the actual building occupied my mind.   For about a week it seemed that my mind and being was trying to process it all and found myself constantly thinking about it or seeking out information to read or see on TV.  I especially found comforting and moved by the symbol of the candle and how people around the world stopped everything they were doing on that Friday with candles and flowers in their hand.  The response from around the world is what touched me greatly. I don\'t want the US to bomb innocent civilians.  I hope that the world unites in seeking out the terrorists around the globe by outsmarting them, cutting off all their assets, finding the terrorist organizations and arresting them all.  To tell you the truth, I wouldn\'t mind if the US were to isolate the whereabouts of bin Laden, to bomb the living daylights out the the man.  But only if they were to isolate his whereabouts. \"\"I do not take my life or anyone else\'s for granted, I am more real and awake.\"out of pure hateOsama bin Laden\"I am more protective toward my children, 17 and 20.  I am feeling exhausted and preoccupied.  I\'m not sure that my behavior is much changed--except that I have been talking a lot about the incidents with family and friends.  I attended a prayer service last week and I went to church on Sunday (thought I usually do attend church).  I\'ve watched a lot more tv than I usually do.  My feelings are impacted more than my behavior.  I\'m deeply sad and frightened.  I have been writing about themes evoked by the attacks: safety and vulnerability.  I allowed my students (college freshmen) to talk about the attacks in class one day, and then we needed to move on.  \"\"Probably Bin Laden and his network of terrorists. However, we don\'t know for certain who is responsible yet.\"\"I am deeply concerned.  I feel like my own safety, that of my family, and the safety of others in the country is threatened.  I realize that the terrorists may have some logical reasons for being upset with the U.S.  Our policies and actions in the Middle East have been less than humanitarian.  I would hope that there could be negotiations between the terrorists and their protectors and the U.S.  I don\'t know if it\'s naive to think that we could have some other response than all out war.  I hope not.  I would hope that we could find a response that is humane and ethical.  If we respond without consideration for human life, then we are no better than the terrorists who have opted to use force to make their points. Sometimes I feel hopeful that we might find some kind of solution to the problem of terrorism, one that includes our country\'s taking responsibility for our actions in the Middle East (killing vast numbers of civilians, continuing to bomb Iraq, placing economics above people, etc.).  Other times, I feel really frightened that the world is wildly out of control, and that our leaders don\'t see many options for how to solve problems. I teach writing.  Perhaps if rhetoric were valued, we wouldn\'t have to resort to violence to make our points.  There are some impressive world peace organizations that ignore the level of politics and encourage the meeting of young people from different countries.  they seem to enjoy success. Perhaps if the world leaders (official and unofficial) work outside the box of traditional political reponses, we really could begin to solve the problems in our world and learn to tolerate differences. On a very personal level, I am grieving deeply for the victims of the attacks and their families and for all of us who are struggling to make some sort of sense of what happened.\"Bin Laden is justifiably angry with the US for what he believes are actions that harm the Saudis and others in the Middle East.  He also sees his fundamentalist Islam as a force to wield against the US.  I heard a commentator say that some of his arguments against the US are rational and some are irrational.  That sounded reasonable to me.  I don\'t fully understand the terrorists\' logic.\"A lifetime of hate, of truly believing the information they have been given over the years, or have decided on for themselves over the years, a real hatred to be able to think about let alone follow-through with the murder of thousands of loves.  But to be honest, if we really understood then would this have ever happened?\"\"I have absolutely no idea.  Probably bin Laden but to pin it on him alone is absolute madness: to think that one person pulled this off is ludicrous, many many others must be involved and must be held responsible for it.  History is there to learn from and therefore we need to look back and acknowledge that one person cannot be responsible for such horrific events on such a huge scale\"\"Overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the attacks and genuinely concerned about the length of time and the numbers of people involved to coordinate such attacks, and be  successful .  AS I understand it more buildings were to be targeted so from the terrorists point of view perhaps they were not as successful as they had planned. I was driving my car when I first heard about it (again another incidence of always remembering where you were when a significant even occurred) and couldn\'t believe what I was hearing.  News, in particular mobile \'phone messages of people trapped in Twin Towers were being played and it was really distressing to hear it, a mixture of distress at these people\'s fate and also trying to imagine being there yourself.   I immediately put the TV on when I got home and watched it solidly for about  4 or 5 hours.  I think the thing that concerns me most is how do you go about any so-called \'retaliation\' when you\'re dealing with people who are prepared to die for their cause and beliefs.  The attitide of a number of Americans concerns me ie neuk Afghanistan, for a number of reasons: too many innocent lives have already been lost and we don\'t need to lose anymore,  and also, there is more than a handful of people involved probably located all over the world and so to think about war in bombing terms goes beyond me.  How much of an impact will killing them actually have if af we have all seen they are willing to fly a plane into the side of a builgin housing thousands of people? I can\'t begin to think how governments think about what form retailiation should take (not even sure if retaliation is the right word), I believe that something needs to be done and I wonder to what extent this could have been avoided if the US security systems within their airports had been a lot tighter.  However, I\'m sure those behind this would find alternative ways to attack seeing as they must have been planning this for years. I also can\'t quite understand why less attention is being paid to the attacks on the Pentagon, although less lives were lost and the devastation less than the Towers surely the fact that a plane was able to be dirven into what is meant to be the USA\'s highest security centre etc. It has raised a huge number of questions for all societies and I am somewhat comforted by the way people have come together to cope and grieve and stand-up and do something.  I do however feel sickened at some people\'s reactions to innocent people purely because of ignorance (and fear, which comes first?).  People\'s need for blame and retaliation has really become apparent over the last few weeks and I hope that lessons will be learned at the invididual and global level. Sorry, I have a meeting to go to so might revisit and write some more as I still have a lot more to say!\"\"Not behaviours per se, more attitudes: I\'m questioning people\'s beliefs a lot more, specifically the deep-held beliefs about their standing in the world and their behaviour in response to that.\"\"terrorists around the world and ourselves, for not being better prepared for something like this.\"\"to make a stand against something they are so fanatical about that they are willing to die themselves. Also, to make a name for themselves, to go down in history for injuring a  superpower. \"\"I am nicer to stangers; I don\'t honk my horn as quickly; I wrote people in my life to tell them I loved them, in case they weren\'t certain; I cry more; I am more appreciative of the love I have; I am more sentimental; I search out knowledge about history; I don\'t bitch about trival things.\"\"I\'m amazed that this could happen. I simply cannot believe it. i find myself sitting in my car, listening to music and suddenly seeing the guys face that was talking on TV about his wife who was just in NY for one day to give a presentation. I think about him a lot and feel so fucking sad that his wife is dead and that he will never see her again.  It\'s really so tragic adn terrible. I feel sad much of the time and angry during other times. Then, feelings of guilt overcome me as I think, well, my husband, family members and friends are alive and well. My life hasn\'t changed to the extent of others. THen, I think about all the poor people in the surrounding areas that can\'t go back to their homes and they are living out of suitcases-like refugees-the first real war of my generation. The persian gulf war was not like this.  I am also trying to learn more about the bin Laden guy. I\'ve been watching Discovery/BBC and trying to get caught up on the history of our country and Afganistan. What is this guy thinking? What drives him? I don\'t think he\'s so smart, I think we are ill-prepared. How can the FBI arrest 25 people in one week, linked to this attack? Where were they 3 weeks ago, before this happened? It\'s not like we didn\'t know bin Laden was responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole and the ebasseys in Africa. That part really makes me nervous. Our lack of security is appalling, yet, who could imagine that this could happen?  Planes hitting buildings? Never in my wildest imagination.  So, right now, I am feelings many different things. The personal stories of those cell phone calls are haunting and horrifying. I cannot imagine being on the other end of the phone and saying goodbye to anyone I adore. This is beyond emotional comprehension. I\'d say that those people will remain etched in my memory for a very long time. The other day, I got in an argument with my husband and for a split second thought, wow, he\'s alive to argue with. We are lucky.   \"\"They have nothing to lose, and have \'faith\' in  their ideas.\"\"My fiance is North African, and he questions whether or not he wants  to marry an american because of the attacks last tuesday and the  racist behavior of so many americans.  However, I think America will  prove itself \'better\' than that in the long run and be a bit more honest with themselves and our place in the world. I honestly believe that we are often no better than terrorists, and that many right wing freaky groups in the US would do the same thing, if  they had the money and means to do so.  Anger, fanaticism, and not a small dose of self-aggrandisement, all exist everywhere, but some are better connected than others. It\'s all sick and horrible, and I think we have, as a nation, failed to spend enough time thinking about how other humans, not the fanatics, but just other citizens of the world, percieve our arrogance and our foreign policy.  We\'ve seen the results of a handful, but what about the more mainstream individuals? This tragedy has had such far reaching consequences, but it also reminds me of similar attacks throughout history--e.g., the jewish pogroms of the  first crusade, the dessimation of natives in Britain following the  arrival of William the Conqueror, senseless slaughter in the Americas in the name of religion. It\'s not religion, its fanatacism, but it exists in every religion or ideology.\"--\"No one person is responsible for the growth of a pernicious ideology. Factors include: US Foriegn Policy, domestic civil liberty acts, tolerance of hate groups, a undersupported intelligence agency, those who inspire hate.\"\"I thought it was truly a horrible tragedy because so many innocent people died.  These people were on their way to work and doing nothing wrong, yet on that day they became victims.  I think something should be done to the people who are responsible for the attack, however, I don\'t think they should be put to death.  If these people were put to death then they would become martyr\'s to the other people who they are representing.  Instead, they should be locked away for the rest of their lives and suffer any consecences that may fall on them.\"I am more leary about flying and transportation security.The taliban\"to induce fear, and more importantly to prove that they can.\"',4,-5,0,2,5,0.5,4.48,0,1,0,0,0,4.23,0,0,1,0,10.72,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,1.49,0,0,0.5,0,1.99,2.99,0,0.75,1,0.5,0,0,5.48,0,0,0,2,0,0.25,1,0,31.66,0.5,5.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,49.11,3.99,0,2.5,0,0.5,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,10.96,17.45,1,0,0,0,3.99,0.25,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0.5,0.5,3.49,Female
'\"At first I did not understand what I was watching.  Being woken at 1.30 am to a friend saying \'turn on the TV, the world will never be the same\' I didn\'t know what I would find.  Shock, horror, I couldn\'t believe it, having visited New York and viewing the world from the top of the tower I thought it was a horrible nightmare and hoped it would be gone when I woke up, but it wasn\'t.  Waves of sickness kept sweeping over me and I found it hard to concentrate at work the next day (along with my colleagues), we just sat and cried and talked and cried. Having completed 20 years in the Australian Navy, I immediately tried to listen to what those in power were saying.  Talk of war, trying to read between the lines, will I be involved as a reservist (my husband is already working in Sydney so who knows).  Now I am trying to put in perspective, trying to work out why those responsible would hate so much, then realising that it will always be a side to humanity that no-one will ever change.  Deep seeded hatred and people who will never forgive or forget injustices committed against present and past generations. I thank God I live in Australia but am not foolish enough to think that it wouldn\'t happen here.  Life goes on amid the pain and suffering by natural causes  or by the hand of man. I pray that from this catastrophe the world can learn by its mistakes and try to start over. God Bless this beautiful world and all the people in it   \"appears to be muslim fanatics out of retribution of injustices caused more aware of family and trying not to let small things become causes of undue stress.  Trying to be tolerant of all people and  trying to forgive those who have done this terrible thing0They feel Americans support a government that imposes its will and force on other countries and they want us to stay out of thier countries and conflicts. I think there are several sources of blame.\"I was devastated to watch the towers fall and realize that our country was not the impenetrable force we all thought it was.  It is horrible to think of all the families that have been torn apart by this tragedy, how many children will grow up not knowing thier parent, how many parents have had to bury thier children prematurely, how many spouses are now widows. I am frightened that this is not the last attack America will see in the following months.  There are too many unprotected sites, and too many ways to cause death and destruction. \"\"Directly: Osama Bin Laden. But I also believe, we as a country, have been terribly arrogant in foreign affairs and awfully remiss in understanding and or listening to the needs of other countries.   We, individually and nationally, have been callous to the plights of other countries.\"Sheer hatred and evil. I think some of this action is like a 3 year olds vicious tantrum...when they think they aren\'t being heard or understood.  To do something this radical says to me that these folks feel like they NEED to be seen and heard.\"You know, it is just a week since it all happened.  I was just a few blocks north of the north tower when the first plane hit; I was on the 7th floor of a building, with windows facing the towers, when the second plane hit.  It was strange because it seems most of us didn\'t comprehend the severity of what was happening as it happened. When I saw that afirst plane hit, I was screaming,  OH my God, all those people  over and over again.  No one was moving; all of us were screaming and looking up.  Then we went about our business--which for me was to go to the job interview I had at 9am.  When I got there, the 2nd plane hit; I said I didn\'t feel safe and left.  I was feeling scared and confused and calm and kind of blank all at the same time. My deepest feelings...are hard to define.  I keep wondering why I was down there when it happened; I ordinarily am NEVER in that part of town.  I have feelings of utter horror at what I witnessed; gratefulness that my mind has blocked much of it already.  I grew up in a town of 5000 and I keep thinking that that is the number of people who have been killed.... and then I am amazed and grateful (?) that it wasn\'t more.  As I walked up the westside highway with thousands of other people, I kept saying  All those people; its got to be 10,000 people  I don\'t know why I picked 10,000 but that is what I was focused on. Seeing both buildings fall was more shocking...my mind shut down deeply at that point.  In fact I saw the first (and only) ambulances that came out and they pulled up and it was fireworkers and ems folks that tumbled out.  It took 2 days before I realized these were victims who had been rescued. I couldn\'t figure out why they were the ones getting out of the ambulances and lying on the street.  I even handed one of them a cup of water and didn\'t comprehend he had been hurt. Someone asked me today if I am angry and I don\'t feel that yet. I am crying a lot; I\'ve been running a fever since it happened; I have diarrhea all the time.  I feel incredibly anxious, especially when planes go over head, especially when they sound too low.  I\'ve been having some auditory flashbacks, where I hear the explosion of that first plane hitting. There first time it happened, in particular, I started running and panicking--the fact that no one else was reacting confirmed my fear that a bomb had gone off b/c there was so little exterior reaction on the street after that plane hit, or in the building when the second plane hit. What else am I feeling? Still dazed. I stare off into space a lot and I see blank looks on the people all around me, on the subway or on the bus. I feel like if I left the city now I might never come back into it again. I don\'t feel safe.  I am fearful what a  phase 2  of this terrorist operation might be like; I don\'t think it is over like some of my friends do. I don\'t like people touching me right now; folks want to hug me and that feels like too much. It kind of repulses me.  Someone wanted to pay for a massage for me and that just seems like the most awful thing I could imagine.  My body feels assaulted.\"\"I am more sober in my ways.  I am not sleeping much.  I am jumpy and on edge.  I missed a couple of days of work.  I\'ve been in contact with folks I haven\'t spoken to in a long time.  I didn\'t sleep in my own home for 5 nights after it happened.  I am a college professor and I am changing, entirely, my semester\'s syllabus.\"Oshama Bin Laden and other terrorist membersI thought the event was a definite tragedy and historical turning point on our country.  I feel the deepest sadness for the people who were killed and their families.  And I have the deepest respect for New York and those who contributed to the attack effort.  I hope that we find who is responsible and bring them to justice.They are disillusioned and angry for the oppression and poverty they are experiencingI am very much leary of middle easterns and do not feel safe anymore\"It seem pretty unreal to me.  As a nation, we go about our daily lives largely ignorant of  much of the suffering that goes on in the rest of the world, and this was a real shake-up to our way of life.  I feel terrible for the people that lost brothers, sisters, parents,  friends, etc.  Everyone seems to know someone that was lost in the tragedy.  I\'ve had  a hard time sleeping since the event, and it seems that everyone I ask has had similar  problems.  We all are trying to assimilate what happened and we all have different ideas  about what should be done.  Our response should be one of compassion and a refusal to  give into anger and aggression.\"\"give more money to charity, reach out more to people I love, be more thankful for family and friends\"\"a few extremist religious folks, probably broken down by poverty and lack of hope in life, vulnerable to the propaganda of a sociopath.\"\"paranoia, brainwashing, desperation for meaning in life, bad family upbringing resulting in them feeling unloved.\"\"MUCH MORE PATRIOTIC - Also as the mother of a pre-teen, this has made me try to better identify my thoughts and feelings in order to help her understand.

Political situations that are beyond my understanding.  Ultimately, man\'s selfishness and sin.\"0\"Selfishness, power, disrespect for others - mental illness\"\"I\'m more fearful of planes flying overhead.  I notice when I\'m in a place of many people because this could be a target.  I had a day of being unable to focus on anything.  I have a sense of patriotism I\'ve never known.  I cry more often (I always have gotten tears) during church, Amazing Grace, and other religious or patriotic events.  I talk more with my neighbors and strangers than I used to (again, I always did).  There is just a greater need now.\"\"The events of September 11 are haunting.  Living near Seattle, you\'d think it wouldn\'t have a profound effect on me, but it has. I first heard it on the radio while getting ready to go to my job...teaching 7th and 8th grade students. For lack of better words, when I heard what happened, I found it an  ordinary  coverage of news events.  It didn\'t really occur to me what had happened and what had been lost.  Then, after the hit on the Pentagon, the radio station, which I listen to because it\'s a fun, humerous way to start the day, said the Lord\'s Prayer.  That move made me realize what was REALLY happening.  I cried and called my husband to tell him the news and that I loved him.  I couldn\'t dwell on this for long, however, because I had to teach that day, so I got ready, immediately turned on the radio in my car and tried to find the words, the way, to express this event to my students.   When I arrived at school, we had a faculty meeting, but we were all watching the live coverage in our school library.  This is the first I\'d SEEN it.  The coverage had people jumping to their death.  I needed to cry, but I couldn\'t.  Our principle told us we could watch the coverage for a few minutes each period, but that the discussion was what he wanted the focus on. In first period, I gave a brief explanation and turned on the TV.  The first thing we saw was the towers going down.  The first thing I heard from them was  cool.   The TV was turned off.  I told them this is cool if it was a movie, cool if it was a special effect, but not cool when you realize it\'s real and nearly 50,000 people and their families worked in those buildings.  That\'s 50,000 mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandpas, and grandpas that may have died.   As the day progressed and news got worse, my students and I talked about military families and students with relatives across the country.  The feeling was of respect.  Only one student did not show reverence and he was quickly halted by the piercing looks from others and the firmness of this need from me. I\'m sharing what my students did, because their reactions melded mine for the first week.  They wrote on the tragedy.  Everything from violence against the person(s) responsible to wishing they\'d died instead of someone elses family member...especially moms and dads who had children to go home to.  They felt the need of those children who in one day became orphans. It wasn\'t until Friday that it really started to hit me personally instead of professionally.  We had the moment of silence at school...956 students and all staff went outside on the track and faced the flagpole at half mast.  The local fire department had it\'s sirens going during the minute proceeding.  Then we had the moment.  Afterwards, the whole group said the pledge of allegence.  My eyes welled up with tears, even as I write this over a week later.  Yet, I couldn\'t REALLY cry.  My students were watching my every movement, gesture, and comment...looking for strength themselves.  It was overwhelming. That night, news had been flooded at us for nearly one week.  My husband and I rented two brainless comedies to forget.  It felt good to laugh, but foreign at the same time.  When planes go overhead, especially since so many are military due to our proximity to the military bases on the coast, I cringe and can\'t help looking outside to see if everything is alright. Early the following week (I think it was Monday) I had a day of being dingy.  I would ask my students a question, wanting an answer, but being unable to concentrate on their responses.  I don\'t know how many times that I had to have them repeat things.  With my husband, it was the same thing.  I just couldn\'t focus.  I\'ve had those moments in my life, but not those days.  It was very frustrating. We thought life would return back to normal the first day the Mariners went back to doing what they do the best.  I\'ve never followed a team like this, and was very excited about the game.  We sat down to watch and cried and their opening ceremonies.  At this point, even my husbands eyes got moist.  The show of patriotism and unity is something I\'ve never experienced before.  I couldn\'t believe we were in that stadium under normal circumstances just a week prior for Cal Ripken\'s last game.  I get the feeling we\'ll never be the same.   Opening ceremonies are through, and the game begins.  I found myself cheering for Ichiro to make it to first.  I stopped short because cheering felt so foreign and somehow so wrong.  Knowing this is an irrational belief, I try to keep cheering.  Then I feel incredible empathy for those trying to play this game when they must have some of those same emotions. I\'m still fearful.  I\'ve never experienced the real fear of war or a draft.  Planes still bother me when I hear them, although I\'ll fly again.  I think they\'re as secure as they\'ve been in a long time.  I\'ve lost some very precious people in my lifetime, so I\'ve always been more thankful and realize the importance of little things.  This has changed even my husband, though.  Now he realizes how important those three words are, as are hugs every day.  I notice my neighbors are more friendly since this happened.  Prayer is finding it\'s way back into lives of people.  Church is more important.  This is another thing that helps my personal mentality on life. I\'ve taught middle school 4 years, and it wasn\'t until yesterday that one of my students asked me if I believe in God.  (touchy issue at school)  I said that I did.  She asked my religion and I told her.  Then I asked hers.  She seemed relieved to have a teacher that believes.  Somehow it must have been a validation to her that she\'s okay to be herself with me. I believe that our president is doing a good job.  I pray for him and his advisors.  I also have learned to pray for the people who did this...knowing they need it more than anyone.  I\'m not a religious fanatic...just and average person who has seen more hope out of desperation than I ever would have believed possible. I\'m currently making quilts for victims and a flag for myself.  Doing something helps the healing for me.   Good luck with your study.\"\"Someone would do this because they felt they were on a mission from God and that it was right.  Also, they might do this to force the USA into noticing them and their ideals.  This may be done to help the terrorist missions around the world gain allies.  Really, I don\'t think a rational person can truly understand why.\"VenLadin\"Anger, feeling of revenge.\"I really do not know. The newspapers are very confusing. But I do believe it was an act against the whole world by a handfull of misguided people.\"Our first reaction was shock, folowed by a feeling of numbness and then panic to see if we had any friends or relatives in the WTC\'s. After frantic phone calls, and to have everyone accounted for there was relief and then guilt. I have felt the whole gamut of emotions. Anger, lots of it at the stupidity of these fanatics, helplessness and guilt. Also relief that my friend and family are safe.\"I feel my personal problems are very small. I also feel very sorry for the average people who are caught in crossfire.I refuse to speculate without knowing all the facts.  I have not kept update with the media.\"I feel more connected to my fellow Americans and to history.  It is as if I have finally lived because something tragic and tremendous has happened in my life time that I am aware of (i.e. for others the Depression, civil rights, WWI, WWII, etc.).  But I guess none of this is really related to my behavior, except that I am more sure of myself and as a member of society; that is, my voice counts and has merit.\"There are two sides to every coin.  I think someone wanted our attention and they got it.\"I find that everyday, in fact every hour, my feelings regarding the whole situation changes.  At times I feel very patriotic and aggressive, while at other times I am simply saddened.  Most of all I am shocked that the events really did occur-it seemed so surreal.  Just hearing about it (plane crashes and buildings) was odd, but actually seeing the crashes on T.V. was quite numbing.  I was relieved that I still had feelings though, because I often feel desensitized to tragedies that don\'t involve people I directly know.  I find it a little unsettling and a bit upsetting to listen or hear about people\'s last words to their loved ones.  These are quite new feelings for me. I also worry about how we intend to counter this aggressive, well thought out, and quite destructive attack.  I am afraid of more innocent people being hurt or blamed.  There is no easy solution.  I hate to be political about this, but I have a difficult time tolerating President Bush.  I think he is very embarassing and will try to use this situation to make himself look better.  When in actuality he will just look, sound, and act dumb.  It worries me that he is in charge of consoling us in this very difficult time.  I am interested to see how America will grow from this situation.  We must learn from it so that it never happens again.  This tragedy has had a tremendous impact on all of us, especially indirectly to us younger adults who have little experience or interest in the rest of the world.\"\"anger, hatred, lack of regard for the rights of others\"\"Terrorists, Osama Bin Laden being a primary leader of such\"\"For a while, I was watching the news more often.\"\"I was at first in a state of disbelief that planes had really crashed into the World Trade Center.  And then, when it became more real, as I heard it on the radio, rather than over the telephone, and as I heard that the Pentagon had also been hit, I felt like our nation was under attack.  Then, of course, I wanted to reassure myself that everyone in my family was safe.  So I called my mother to find out what time my aunt, uncle, and cousin were supposed to take off from California.  I was trying to make sure they were not on one of the ill-fated planes.  We didn\'t know at that time exactly where all of the airplanes had taken off from.  I was relieved that my family was only supposed to arrive on the East coast at 8 p.m. that evening, so I felt reassured that they were not on one of the four planes that crashed that day, and I felt a real sense of relief, and then the need to communicate this information to others in my family who might also be worried.

I\'m in disbelief that people think they are doing what is right by murdering innocents.  I\'m shocked at the propaganda people buy into. I\'m worried about my little girl -- she\'s 2 1/2. I weep for the people who\'ve lost their little girls and boys and those little girls and boys who\'ve lost they\'re parents.  I weep for the nation\'s loss. Though I\'m in Texas and those I know where not physically harmed at all, I weep because on the 11th, this Texan became an American. I\'m angry that the attackers used God\'s name in this.  I heard a man say that whenever a group invoking God\'s name for their purpose speak to death, they are wrong because God ALWAYS speaks to life. And that\'s the way to tell Good apart from Evil. I\'m not sure on how many levels that applies (I think someone earns the death penalty) but I feel it applies on this grand scale. I\'m angry at those Christians who are saying America deserves this like Pat Robertson and Falwell. As if we asked for this. We\'re not an evil nation. God says those who bless Israel will be blessed by God and I believe we bless Israel. I believe we\'re called by the Europeans and Japanese  The Land of Thou Shalt Not  for a reason. How can a preacher say America deserves this and yet numerous other countries are either agnostic, atheist, or polytheistic? I believe in America\'s heart and that it turns to God much as we have now. I believe in the right to not be forced to pray in public schools -- I don\'t want my daughter to have to pray a hindu prayer because she\'s in an Indian majority school. Mostly I\'m angry and sad.

In my sleep, I couldn\'t imagine.  He told me a plane had crashed into the WTC.  I had seen the WTC when visiting New York, and he asked me to describe it, but I was sick and tired, so I told him I wanted to sleep. In the morning, I listed to the radio on the way to work, but it wasn\'t until I got home from work and watched the imagery on TV that I realised the enormity of it.  Of course, I had been sad all day - I teach at university, and many of my students are American, so I knew this had changed the world.  Unfortunately, nothing could prepare me for the imagery I saw on television. I was particularly devestated by watching the people flying their flags out the window, or jumping out of the building.  Seeing people looking for their loved ones was upsetting, and I cried often. I became very clingy toward my fiance, and when I couldn\'t contact him on phone (he was very busy in his job due to the attacks) I got upset, even though I was in another country.

I worry about how the USA should respond to the attacks.   I don\'t feel particularly safe, but I\'m not going to avoid doing what I normally do. I mostly feel very very sad and emotionally drained.  I feel so terribly for the families who lost loved ones AND I feel badly for the rescue and clean up workers for I am sure they are encountering some ghastly scenes that they will never be able to erase from their memory.  I\'m sure there will be many cases of PTSD coming from this.  I feel like I can\'t quit watching TV, even though it keeps me immersed in the sadness.  Sometimes I even turn away when they show the planes crashing into the WTC --- it\'s just too hard to watch.  It is quite a helpless feeling. I feel angry at Bin Laden and whoever else is responsible.  I wonder how their beliefs have been shaped and what the USA has done in the past to offend them so.  It is incomprehensible that ANY religion would condone this type of mass killing.  It is very sick, but I believe the perpetrators truly believe they are doing the right thing.  That is VERY scary.   RE: the USA response: On the one hand, though my anger, I want us to bomb the hell out of Afghanistan.  However, I would hate for us to kill innocent people AND I fear that we will radicalize even more muslims.  I worry about our troops goign in to A. and then getting showered with biological/chemical agents -- like an ambush that we are not expecting.   I think the best course is to get the world to cooperate and share intelligence information so that maybe, in 10 -20 years, we can weed out terrorism.  I think economic sanctions and possibly military strikes against the countries who will not cooperate should be used (but this should not be seen as coming only from the US, it needs to be a world effort).

It all seemed so surreal - as if I were watching a movie unfold.  Once the reality of the situation took hold, I felt anger and rage - not only at the terrorists who would dare to do this deed, but also at my government for being asleep at the helm.  How could we, with all our sophistication have not taken greater precautions.  While I realize hindsight is 20-20, surely there were indications of this threat. When I think of how I\'ve been stopped at airports - stopped at various intersections for a registration check, it amazes me that the powers that be were not more aware and prepared. Now that the initial shock has worn off and the venting has quieted down, I feel such sympathy for those who lost their loved ones.  I feel great appreciation for the job being done to clean up Ground Zero and I have nothing but admiration for those who joined in the rescue. I am glad that we are not allowing this event to go unanswered.  While I have never been a proponent of war, I am fully behind my president on this.

It looked like something out of a movie, not something that was actually happening. We just sat there and watched it most of the day, unfortuantly I still had to go to my classes, something I wasn\'t in the mood to do.  While no one close to me was hurt in this tragedy, I know people who have lost family members, and my heart goes out to them.

If the United States does not respond in a forceful action we women may all end up like those in Aphganistan.  Non persons.  The tragity is a crime against humanity that must be answered!  I do not understand why the Taliban can not keep to their own country and leave us alone.  So what if we are a nation of freedom and overindulgence.  What concern is it to them?  There leader is a member of the elite in society.  I feel these men are hipocrits and if we do not get this branch of the Muslim religion undercontrol women all over the world may become as inferior as the Muslim\'s see the Jews.  I am afraid.  I do not want to be stripped of my rights for any reason.  The United States has many things not to be proud of, slavery, child labor, coal, steel, and textile labor, persecution of the Indians, I am afraid since we let these happen in our country who\'s to say persicution of women or even as general as persecution of Americans can not occor in America or around the world.  The millions of Jews were exterminated in Poland and Germany, could this happen to Americans?  9-11 is a tell-tell sign of what is to come and I am frightened for my children and my childrens children.  9-11 is not just one day of violence, but I am afraid it is going to be a life time of violence for all Americans.\"\"Alquida, Taliban, MEN\"more patriotic and anger toward ALL Muslim\'s.

I felt shock, disbelief and then anger.  My best friend arrived back from NY that morning of September 11 and I was relieved that she was back but felt so much for the families who have lost and are missing loved ones.  I watched the telecast all night and still am constantly reminded of what is happening in the United States and in Afghanastan through media coverage.  I actually am thinking about the attacks so much that I dreamt about my home city of Brisbane being attacked.  I think everyone here in Australia is feeling very lucky and safe to be here.  We feel somewhat removed from the drama as we are quite a long distance away.  This is no excuse to think that we are not a target or the US embassies are not a target.  I will never forget the day of September 11 and I am so relieved that my friends who live in NY are safe and well.  I think that these terrorist attacks will be the start of a new war that will last for many years.  Being at an age where in the next 5 years I would like to have children, it makes you think twice as to if you would want to bring a child up in this sort of hatrid.  \"\"To gain attention, to make sure the whole of the world knows that they are not playing childish games, that they will kill as many people in as many cities as they need to.\"Increased prayer Hung out American Flag\"I think it has been a horrible tragedy.  The number of lives lost is horrible-- the number of lives disrupted cannot even be guessed at.  I feel that, for many individuals in the US, the assumption of safety will never be the same again.  One of the most horrible parts of the tragedy is the loss of life among firemen, police, and EMTs.  Those who gave their lives in an attempt to save others should never be forgotten.  Everyone I know has been touched in some way by this.  Although I live several states away from NY and DC, I know people who worked in and around the WTC.  It seems that everyone has some link ot the tragedy-- reminds us of the few degrees of separation between any two people in this age of mobility.  I think this will unite the US- at least in the short term.  I also think the world community has come to our aid/defense/support in an admirable fashion.  I hope that this unity can last and serve as a constant reminder of failure to those who perpetrated this crime.    \"Osama Bin LadenMisguided belief system- religious or political Envy/hatred for the US and the capitalism that is represented by our countryThankful and appreciative of my family.

Also when I hear a commercial plane go overhead I get an eerie feeling.\"Terrorists, people who feel that the U.S. is immoral,folks who believe we are evil, that we are bullies, that we take sides with countries and leaders that perhaps we should not, they think we defile their way of life and their sacred grounds.  Mostly religious fanaticals and leaders who hate the way america does business with the rest of the world.\"\"I watched the events unfold on television while getting my daughter ready for school.  At first I thought it was some horrible accident or movie trailer.  And when the realization of what occurred had actually sunk in, I couldn\'t take my eyes off the news broadcasts or concentrate on  anything else.  Over the course of the next few days I shed tears for all of those unfortunate lives lost or their loved ones left to pick up the pieces of this tragedy.  As warm and loving sentiments were recieved from all over the nation and the world it again brought tears to my eyes to learn of the kindness of others.  I did not personally know any of the victims or families, yet as a fellow American I felt attacked. And I felt their pain...as anyone who has lost a loved one knows the emptiness and sorrow. The sorrow was then followed closely by anger.  Retribution for the murder and destruction....and always the sorrow watching the daily digging at  ground Zero ...as media refers to the site.      I also feel fear here in my own country.  Never before have I considered the possibility of an attack on American soil, now the reality of this assault brings that nightmare to light. I am fearful for my family, my 16 yr old son who may have to go to war, for my way of life.      In the back of my mind I think of the millenium, the crazy notions of the end of the world and wonder if this could actually be a foreshadowing.  I tell myself these are silly notions but the fear still remains.      I am able to go about my daily routines  without difficulty, but I know my life will be forever changed by this event. I pray a little more often, love my country more and wish that we could return to life as it  used to be .     I do not fear riding on an airplane, although I have not been in an airport recently and don\'t look forward to the experience.     I do have some fears that we will be fighting some of this latest war effort on our own soil, and that this could lead to an all out nuclear war...and I guess that would actually be my biggest fear.\"\"They hate americans, they hate the way we live, they think we are Godless, they think we defile their way of life.  They probably also believe that we have treated their country and fellow countrymen with disrespect and have not been fair with their plights.\"That\'s very hard to say. I don\'t thinkt that my mind is able to comprehend the reasoning behind it. Anger? Frustration? Jealousy?I don\'t know that my behaviors have really changed. I guess I\'m paying a little more attention to the news.\"I feel extremely sad about what hapenned on September 11th. It truly came as a shock to me. When I first heard about it on the radio, I didn\'t think that it was real. It sounded too unbelievable, as if it must be a sick April Fool\'s joke. The images and stories that followed were heartwrenching. I kept trying to imagine what it must have felt like to the people in the World Trade Center. For the ones that surrived, I think about their fear. For the ones that didn\'t survive, I wonder if they knew what was going on, and what their last thoughts were. Most of my information came from the radio rather than the television. I don\'t know if this made the event more or less real to me. In some ways I think that it made it more terrifying, since my imagination formed the pictures and images of what I heard. I would have to say that I feel more sad than angry. I just don\'t have much in me that wants revenge. In some ways I think I\'m more angry at the Americans who have been terrorizing Muslim-Americans and making them feel unsafe in their own country. Maybe this is simply because it seems more local and, therefore, real to me. I just feel like people who are assaulting Islamic people in the U.S. are distorting what it means to be an American.  I also feel like a very strange mood has swept the country since September 11. It seems like everywhere I look, I see signs saying  God Bless America,  flags tied to cars and being frayed in the wind, even dogs wearing flag collars. There just seems to me to be something shallow and artificial about some of this nouveau-patriotism. It\'s not that I don\'t love what this country stands for. Far from it. It\'s just that it seems like we have filled the pain and questions with  Product America.  Where were all these flag bearers before September 11? I\'m just afraid that patriotism, like so many other things, has become a commodity. \"\"Well, it looks as though groups funded by Osama bin Laden executed the attack. However, I don\'t know that this has been proven. \"I often think about sense of life and about future of my little son...\"It really schoked me!!

I can\'t understand it. Especially if there are religious couses of this terror attacks.  I feel deep sympathy with all American people, who have lost sombody in this horrific tragedy. I have no words to say how much sorry I am about yours nattional tragedy...   (I\'m sorry about my not so good English)     \"Islams fundamentalistsI donn\'t know. Ben Laudan from afganastan and his people\"When I first heard about the events that took place on September 11, I really wasn\'t sure what to think. I do not know a lot about world issues and I just didn\'t understand how anyone could do what they did to our country. I was not angry first, but more sad and just disturbed. All day I was a little paranoid as to what would happen next. I didn\'t and I don\'t understand how anyone can take their life and kill thousands of innocent people. When I got back from some of my classes I turned the news back on to see if there was anymore information. This is when I saw people of other countries dancing and giving out candy in their streets, celebrating the events that took place on attack in America. This made me sick and very angry. Not only do I not understand how anyone can do what they did to America, but how can you celebrate about it as much as you hate our country? If America had done to another country what they did to us I can guarantee that I would not be celebrating. It makes me think that there are entire countries filled with people who have many psychological problems that would be seen as very unstable and  possibly crazy in our country. The one thing that I thought was neat about the events that occurred on September 11th was the fact that so many americans came together and helped one another out. As of right now I am not paying very much attention to what is happening. I wish people could just sit at a conference table and agree upon everything, but I know that is unfortunately not the way the world works. \"\"I was a little disturbed at first, but I am the same as always except now I get a little paranoid everytime I even think I hear a plane.

I told my housemates (Indian) to be carefull.\"It was the most terrifying event since the end of WWII. However, I don\'t agree with Bush and American people regarding current attack to Afganistan. One reason is that I don\'t think terrorism vanishes. There are many terrorist groups all over the world and they might be stimulated by Bush saying  this is the war against terrosism . Another reason is that many innocent people were killed or injured in Afganistan or neibour countries, and Bush has not apologised about it. Final reason is that the U.S. or other countries are not prepared for bio-terrorism. It is necessary to take some kind of strong action towards Osama, but it\'s not the right time to show aggressive behaviour. It does not bring any good consequences. I am scared of American people who started buying American national frags and put them on front door of their house. Nationalism makes people unite, but it always includes discrimination or bad feelings towars someone else. Many Muslim people as well as other race including Indian are suffering. Also, some American politicians say that the attack was the same kind as the attack on Pearl Harbour by Japanese. But the attack by Japanese was against the war enemy of America who had attacked Japan as well. It was a totally different situation from that time.  All the behaviours by American seem to include some kind of aggression...\"\"Isonation from each other\'s viewpoint, strong leaders (Osama and Bush), Cohesiveness, nationalism (sometimes racism)\"Terrorists (who did the terrible thing) and American (who did not understand the Muslim\'s viewpoint)\"Capitalism, the economic and military oppression by the first world of the third world, ignorance of first world societies (helped by the media)\"\"Because they have seen their children blown apart by American bombs, they have watched their baby die through lack of food due to UN sanctions, there are no channels for them to gain medicines and food\"\"I am trying to be more loving, I\'m meditating and spending more time with close friends.  I am trying to keep up to date with events.  I am writing letters and signing petitions, to try and stop war.\"\" I watched the events live - i felt terror, shock and deep sadness.  I couldn\'t believe people were dying in front of my eyes.  I stayed up till 4am crying, I needed to be with close friends...not a time to be alone.  I have felt sad ever since, I feel for the families and victims, it is a human tragedy and i can\'t shake it from my mind.  I am scared of what will happen - i don\'t believe further violence will resolve the solution.  I don\'t believe in vengeance or revenge - they are not the actions of a civilized democracy.  What will further bombs achieve, apart from equal suffering amongst innocents?  How are Afgani tears less important than americans? Why can\'t we distribute food, aid and erase world debt?  What a different outcome there would be -...Why are all our lives in the hands of the military establishment in america? But even whilst having these reactions, i was aware of our hypocrisy and the role of the media.  People have been dying in Iraq, Afganistan, Somalia, Nicaragua, Granada etc etc because of direct american military oppression (supported by varying australian governments) - but have we seen these images in the media? Have we had honest media reporting of the carnage? Does anyone know that the average life expectancy in Afganistan is 47 and it\'s 76 in America? Why are we bombing these people who are suffering? In Australia, we have seen footage of palestinians laying flowers on the steps of the american consulate - my lover (in austin) tells me the only images americans have seen are of palestinians dancing in the streets.  The media has shown us sanitized versions of US military oppression (CNN\'s coverage of strikes on  military targets  in Kuwait), justified with propoganda from the military establishment ( Operation Infinite Justice  - how are the american military establishment qualified to decide on  infinite Justice?   Doesn\'t systematically starving Iraqi women and children, supporting invasions in the middle east, providing arms to terrorists to defeat the Soviet Union equal terrorism?  It certainly does in the eyes of the people on the bitter end of such action).   I feel that america (and australia and the first world) have been too ignorant and complacent for too long.  5,000 Iraqi women and children have been dying every month because of the sanctions placed by the UN (mainly driven by the US), 200,000 Iraqi\'s have died since the Gulf War - why are 6,000 New Yorkers more important?  I\'m not condoning any of these deaths, each and everyone is a tragedy, but this action must be placed into the context of american violence and military action against other cultures.  America is a part of the global community, it does not exist in a bubble. And ultimately, actions will have consequences. World debt and capitalism are the real evils here, terrorism is just a symptom. Ignorance is no excuse.  We don\'t like to think that our lifestyle results in death and suffering for millions of people.  I can\'t believe Americans are shocked and question why there is this level of hate.  If anyone looks at infant mortality rates (6/1000 in America, 5/1000 in Australia, 140/1000 in Afganistan) the question becomes irrelevant.  I know there is no easy solution, but i feel we are going in the wrong direction.  This violence was born out of suffering, creating more suffering by our violence will only promote more terrorism. Suffering is the direct result of capitalism and the lifestyles of the first world.  We need to go to the source of the problem - redistribute resources, eradicate world debt - rather than show that we are better terrorists and can create more destruction than the next military regime.  There is no right way of thinking or living when it relies on the oppression of other people - capitalism is as guilty of this as other regimes.   The only thing that may be positive from this terrible event is the next time an american hears about people dying in war, they may have a little more empathy.  We need our humanity and spirituality to rise above economic interest and military power...                                 \"It is one of those things that you would only expect to happen on movies.

'I am less likely to feel safe on an airplane.  I say  I love you  more often.  \"I feel unsafe.  I am afraid of the future.  In my opinion, war is wrong.\"I don\'t know.I don\'t know.\"Hmm .. My thoughts and feelings when? If I would have been asked in the hours directly following the attack I probably would have answered \'scared to death and mad as hell\'. Oh, wait. That answer still applies. Only now it\'s tempered with a thousand other thoughts and feelings. I\'m still scared. I\'m scared of retailiating and I\'m scared of not retailiating. I\'m scared if we retailiate how do I explain it to my kids when I\'ve preached \'turn the other cheek\'. I\'m scared if we strike back, will they strike back even harder? I\'m frightened that if we don\'t strike back we\'re sending a message to our sons that they no longer have the responsibility to grow up and as men, protect the things that they hold precious. I worry that my kids will grow up without the pride in being an American that I always assumed was just plain there. It never needed a justification before, it was just evident. I wonder what the consequences will be of explaining to them that evil was born out of a religious devotion when I\'ve always prayed that they would hold a faith so close to their hearts .. will they someday be suspicious that faith is a fertile ground for evil? God, I hope not. I\'ve learned some lessons too. I\'ve increased my viligance against relying on a sound-byte length attention span. I don\'t want to be colored by the media telling me how to feel or the president telling me that it\'s time to stop grieving. Maybe it\'s that I don\'t trust the people anymore that I assumed would warn me of this. You know what\'s probably the worst part? I found a hard spot that I didn\'t think that I had. There is a part of me that isn\'t interested in looking at the reasons that the terrorists struck, that just wants a swift and tidy revenge. Even worse, there are times when I wish I could forget what happened. It\'s disconcerting to find such a blatantly self-centered edge in myself. Above all, I\'ve worried that I\'m not exposing my kids to the *right* way to deal with this, or the *right* way to think about this, because I have no idea what that is. I wish I could find a way to teach them to temper tolerance with healthy suspicion without making them question stereotypes and encouraging bigotry. ::shrug::.. I like to think that focusing on the heroes that were born in NYC and DC helps to teach them some things about right and wrong. \"Heh .. I\'m more suspicious.

I could not even imagine that it would be some Americans.  \"\"So far my behaviors that I can control have not changed that much.  I have watched more news than ever before.  Although, now I worry about death a lot and have trouble sleeping and cry more at night.  I am going on a plane this weekend, so I am not sure how I am going to react to that, but my friend is really worried about my safety, but I think it is fine.  My dad would not let me go otherwise, plus now is the time that security is the strictest.\"\"I do not know anyone directly injured or killed in the attack, but I know several people that it is effecting in its aftermath.  This whole situation really scares me.  It is hard for me to imagine being in a war.  Most of the people who are going to be sent off are in my age group- in my generation.  They are my friends.  I also don\'t know if going and attempting to kill one person is the answer.  I am terribly upset about all the events, and I don\'t want to take an attitude of doing nothing, but the situation is so difficult.  I can only criticize without really coming up with any other solutions.  I don\'t want any more innocent people to die in a war nor do I want more people to be killed as revenge for killing another who is responsible.  These people are all over the place and it will be hard to get them all.  I am also nervous, not just because my friends would be leaving, but how is this country going to change.  My boyfriend wants to go and join the army if they need him- I already live in a different city from him now, but I can\'t imagine him overseas and in danger all the time.  And then I think about all the hate that is going on right here in our country.  My friend is Indian and her brother is recieving death threats because he looks Pakistani.  Another one of my friends on campus is receiving horrible telephone calls.  If we start stereotyping people now and acting in hateful ways, they are just going to get mad.  This is exactly what the terrorists wanted to divide us.  I just wish that people would see that.  I am worried about my friends and how they are being treated, I am worried for our country, I am worried about the impending war.  I can\'t even imagine what it would have been like to be in the building on that day.  I heard a man talking about it he was just saying that he was in a group of people and every moment that group was getting smaller.  I can\'t watch the news without crying.  I want to move on from all of this, but at the same time I feel terrible about it.  It is so far away, and yet so close at the same time.  We still had classes when it happened and I kept asking myself way I am in class when this horrible thing is going on- does public speaking really matter that much today.  I live with three very compassionate people who share my views and empathy for those directly invovled in the tragedy which helps- but I hear other people talking and just saying that we should blow up Pakistan.  Then I hear that India is trying to bargain with us for their support.  I am just so shocked that another country would take advantage of us this situation.  I couldn\'t handle having to fight their war also.  This is all so crazy.  It is really hard to take in and find out where we go from here.  I just hope that people start to calm down and not take their frustation out on other Americans.  It is a slow process to get rid of prejudice, but we were making some what head-way.  I hate to see all that head-way go to waste.  I am also proud of many celebrities and others who I watched to jump to the aid of everyone.  That telethon and all the people going to donate blood.  I even saw a story about a little girl who gave away her teddy bear to child who she thought needed it more.  It is great that we can bond in these ways, I just wish that people would be able to extend thier selflessness and tolerance to all Americans.  All my thoughts are just a jumble still ruminating in my head.  Its like all those thoughts are still there, but at the moment I am trying to push them away so I focus on what I need to do now.

I ask why not yet realising the events going on. Dad then explained that two planes were known to have been hijacked and had flown into the World Trade Centre buildings. My initial react came as quite a surprise to me. I began to laugh thinkning he was joking but quick turn on the TV to verify the authenticity of his claim. When I saw that image of the second plane flying into the building I was sickened - words simply don\'t adequately describe the utter mix of emoitions I experienced. From saddness, anger, fear and shock. I to remained transfixed. I have actively followed updates and all developments. That night my family met for a family dinner together, a rarity at best, but on this occassion it went unsaid that, that was just thing that should be done. We all watch the TV recounting our day and bits we had heard, imaging the horrors that people would be and had experienced, ie.e those on the planes, on the ground, the families, rescue workers the list goes on. We cried together and late in the week went to the American Embassy where flowers, candles and cards were placed. That week was black it felt as if everyone was in mourning, for a loss of innocence and personal safety. I will never ever forget that day. Neither will my faltmate whose experiences, being a dual Amercian and Australian citizen, were just as painful.\"Appreciate others moreIgnorance and total frustration and a vastly different moral and religious belief to the majority of Americans and Australians\"THe issues surroundings the Sept 11th attacks are numerous and complex and date back many years. The direct action was as a consequence of Taliban extremists, it is now thought. ALthough much of what we know is filtered and through American media channels. While I do not doubt that those who committed these atrocities were evil what must be remembered is that AMerica has historically alienated itself from certain countries through its wealth, position and foreign policies.\"Delutional beliefs about how to effect the changes they want.  Their own angerA small group of cult members who call themselves Muslims- but clearly do not follow the koranI don\'t believe Amercia will recover from this for a very long time.  It has changed the way we veiw our lives and our safty.  I feel less secure in my day to day life.  From deaths to lay offs in one moment our culture and lives are different- due to the actions of so fewI live in NYC and now avoid the subway when possible.  I do not want to go downtown or near landmarks or possible targets\"My first thought was I can\'t believe this is happening. It was like I was watching a movie, but the hero never showed up to save the day. The next emotion was complete sorrow. All those people who went to work thinking it was just another day. Maybe they kissed their loved ones good-bye for the day, maybe not. I then began to panic, what next, where would the next strike be? Am I not to expect to have kids? Is this how it will all end? Right now I\'m still very sad, depressed and quite angry! How dare they come to the country that opened it\'s arms and takes in all who seek refuge from whatever. I can\'t believe their are people in this world who hates us because we can take numerous amounts of bathes, or throw away the food we can\'t finish at lunch. God has blessed America, there is nothing we did or can do to deserve the wealth that HE has given to this Nation. To see everyone pull together at this time is like a hot cup of soup on a cold day. I can honestly say I AM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!!! Thank you for allowing me to rant.\"I can\'t stop expressing my love for those who are in my life. No matter who strained the relationship may have been before this happened. It\'s like the slate has been whiped clean.

Usama bin Laudin0\"I believe that the terrorists have a lot of hate in themselves and other people.  I don\'t understand how they can kill so much innocent people without feeling any remorse.  I believe that at times like these is when we dhould show people how much we love oneanother and how we should get closer to God. How we should be prepared for our own death, because  of what has happend, death can come and take many of us away, in one second to another.  We should also ask God for forgiveness for all that we have done. \"I feel that I am more aware of how we are nothing in this life and that only the good deeds are the ones that count. to try to bring the USA down',4,-5,0,2,5,0,3.67,0,0.73,0,0,0,2.94,0.73,0,0.73,0,8.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.73,0,0.73,0,0,0,0,2.93,2.57,0,0,13.59,0,0,0.73,11.38,0,0.37,0,1.83,0,0,3.31,0.73,49.91,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,61.28,2.2,0,14.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.47,11.37,2.2,0.73,0,0,4.04,0,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0.73,0,0,2.2,Female
'\"Maybe they felt it was thier justice, or maybe they have anti-social personalitiy disorder and thought it would be fun to be famous. (sick and twisted)\"\"The terrorist are the ones who attacked our nation September 11, but it also makes me wonder if they have been wronged in the past, and thought this was thier justice. So I\'m kinda confused on that right now and still thinking about whose fault it is. Surely those innocent people should not have died though. \"\"I was truly shocked by what happend that morning. Sometimes I am kinda niave and just do not realize that America is not the most loved nation by everyone. I didn\'t realize that somebody could hate us so much that they would kill that many innocent people. When I first heard about it, I was filled with fear. I didn\'t know if it was only the beginning, or just someone saying,  See they are not invicible, but I\'m not going to risk it again becuase I might get caught.  Then after a few days when all the information sunk in, then I started feeling a lot of anger. That they could be so uncaring, and so inhumane to do that to anyone. But then I staring thinking about all the stuff the Americans have done to people in the past. And I thought maybe anger wasn\'t a good response, because maybe it was hypocracy. I am a peace loving person and don\'t want to even concider war, even though Bush seems to be all for it. Yes, I agree we cannot just idely sit by and let them get away with it, becuase that will send out the message that if you bomb the United States, they will do nothing to you, so you can do whatever you want. Lets just tear them apart. But we cannot also attack the rest of the World to fix what happend. If we start attacking the rest of the world, it may lead to a third World War, and everyone will just be in ruins again, and the economy will go down, and nobody will be better off. Even with the weapontry that we have today, earth as we know it would probably change. There is probably enough nuclear weapons to blow the earth up, or severely misshape it. Then no one would have anything to argue about, becuase there would be no one left. I think there has to be a more sensible way than war to seek jusice. \"My thoughts about how secure the future is has changed. I am no longer sure that we will live in peace for a long time. Now I fear that fighting might be part of our future and not just for several years. \"Since Sept. 11, I have gone back and forth between disbelief and horror.  Sometimes it doesn\'t seem like it could have possibly happened.  It\'s also hard to grasp the numbers--between the WTC, the Pentagon, and the 4 flights, there will be about 6,000 people dead--it\'s hard to get my head around those numbers.  It\'s horrifying. Since the attack, I\'ve been feeling grief and I\'ve been feeling on edge.  I read the newspapers, but it\'s too hard to watch the T.V.--the interviews with the family members of the dead or missing are too upsetting.   I guess it is encouraging to see how people are bonding together.  As a Canadian citizen living in Canada, I\'ve been touched by the solidarity that people in my city have shown.  There are U.S. flags in front of people\'s homes, and everyone that I\'ve talked to has been very emotional and empathetic to those whose lives have been changed forever by this tragedy.  I\'m not trying to equate our grief with the feelings that U.S. citizens must feel...it must be especially impactful when it is your country that has been a target of terrorism...but I think it\'s important for Americans to know that people in other countries care at this time of deep and profound sorrow.\"probably bin Laden and his henchmenI\'ve been reading the newspapers more carefully and I have had troubles sleeping.  \"they must believe that they are justified, although it\'s hard to understand how they would feel that way.  \"I try no to sweat the small stuff.  I am more patient with my students.  I question sounds I can not identify.  I am more familiar with the geography of the Middle East.  I am drinking  more!They are sociopaths who are fueled by arrogant American policies in the Middle East.\"The attack of September 11 has affected me profoundly.  From the moment I heard the news everything seemed to spin out of control, and the lack of control or not knowing what was to come next is what un-nerved me the most.  I was told of the first plane hitting the Trade Center at around 8:55 am.  I was called out of my third grade class and told by an administrator that a parent had called the school with the news that a plane had hit the World Trade Center.  (The woman who called our school has children who go here.  She had been contacted by her husband who was in the building when the plane hit.  He called to tell her he was fine.  He never made it out.  This of course, we did not learn until much later.) I knew immediatedly that we were under attack and felt that cold fear run down my body.  Too many Tom Clancy books!  Our instructions were not to tell the children, to keep calm and return to our regular routine.  I returned to class and went straight for the computer and tried to get onto CNN.com without success.  A quick call to the computer room and I learned that our headmaster had ordered our internet access terminated.  thus insued some very real frustration for me, I NEEDED to know, had friends downtown and family unaccounted for.  In our classrooms, there is no access to the outside world other than the computer which had been shut down.  I grabbed my cell phone and managed to get two calls off to my parents who did nothing but confirm my fears, we were under attack by terrorists and now the pentatgon was on fire.  To now be holding all this horrific news and be in a room full of 8 and 9 year olds, to know my day would not end until 4:30 when school was dismissed, and to not be able to leave my class and talk about it with colleagues and friends was as close to torture as I\'ve ever been.  I finally rounded up my fellow third grade teachers and told them we should get the kids outside for recess, take turns covering them while we alternated going to the few phones on campus with outside access to call who we needed to call.  It was a long and tortuous day, one in which I found myself wearing my sunglasses inside and leaving the class briefly to go into the bathroom and cry.  During our breaks we found that 2 rooms had televisions with cable access and there we could watch CNN.  (We don\'t have a faculty room so we had to be cautious that children didn\'t enter these rooms.)  I didn\'t sleep for more than a few hours each night for at least 2 weeks after the attack.  On the Thursday after the attack when I opened my door to leave for school in the morning, the wind had shifted and the air was filled with a smoke like none I\'d ever smelled before, and I knew I was smelling death.  My mantra became  Please don\'t cry today  as I found myself in tears everyday while driving to work.  Songs affected me deeply.  During recess we\'d hear the roar of fighters and be able to look up and see them.  This was not pure comfort.  The kids drew real and vivid pictures of the attack.  One boy in my class lost his favorite uncle.  My students saw me cry and we acknowledged our fears.  this was a small silver lining in that we bonded deeply during those days, we were truely honest with each other.     The first Thursday night after the attack there was an incredible thunderstorm.  I remember that I had been lying awake in bed, with my eyes closed.  I have two skylights above my bed and there was a flash that I could  see  with my eyes closed and then a tremendous boom.  I had no doubt that I had just heard a nuclear explosion, and I just waited in my bed for the end to come.    Talking with others has helped.  It helps to know that we\'re not alone with our fears.  News coverage is frightening.  Especially network news that uses its talent of making stary dogs seem lethal to pump up the volume of terrorism...I have taken refuge in NPR and the BBC.   I am afraid for my niece and nephew and the world they might inherit.     As a single woman this attack has emphasized a feeling of being alone.     I am a voracious reader who has been unable to read anything lately except the New York Times.     I yearn for a world in which understanding our differences is a priority, instead of a casualty of profit.    I still cry when I think of what has happened to my city.   I worry that we are not doing enough to protect ourselves in airports or on planes because it is too expensive for the airlines.   I worry that much of our actions are guided by our  need for oil  and those who profit from this need.   I wonder why the women of America and other free societies have not risen up in unrelenting protest against the Taliban.  \"\"The Taliban, extremist Muslim terrorists.\"Because they are angry and don\'t have cruise missles. \"I have felt every emotion possible - mainly a deep sense of grief and helplessness.  I fear that the country that my granddaughters will grow up in will be much different from the U.S. that I have known.  I also feel a sense of personal and corporate guilt.  This is mainly because I have been involved for years in the peace movement.  I have seen and experienced the deep loss that people in Central American and the Middle East have experienced at the hands of political institutions backed by my government.  I have visited with human rights groups in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and with the Mothers of the Disappeared in Guatemala.  I have learned from my friends and from associations about the oppression of Palestinians in the occupied territories.  I feel the pain daily of the mothers of Iraq where the excess infant and under 5 mortality is estimated by the UNICEF to cause the death of more than 5,000 children every month since the Gulf War.  I feel pain as the U.S. continues to bomb communications, water plants, and other civilian infastructure in Iraq (about 2-3 times a week)while enforcing illegal no-fly zones.  I feel pain for the people of Columbia who are displaced, sick, and hungry because the U.S. is defoliating areas under the pretext of a war on drugs.  I feel totally helpless because I have been ineffective in convincing people in my faith community and in my neighborhood or the congressional representatives that I have contacted that we must have a change of heart in international policy.  I fear that the U.S. will act rashly and victimize even more people.  \"I have become more active in the peace movement. U.S. foreign policy. Not many ways really. I was always reasonably up to date in the news although now I check a few times a day and take a more active interest overall and make more of an effort to get the depth of the story.I do believe a muslim terrorist group is responsible such as Bin lardens. It is difficult to know if he personally is responsible although the evidence seems to suggest that if he is not directly responsible he is at least a key player.\"I believe they really believe they are doing the work of the Lord. That through the sacrafice they make and the sacrafices of the lives of others that they are fulfilling their religious obligation (although the acts are not in direct accordance with the Koran) and that they are trying to bring the plight of their people and country to a nation (the nations) of the world who have for so long, either ignored their problems or in some cases caused them.\"\"Like many people I was totally shocked by the events of Sept 11. Living so far away I was actually rather surprised at the extent of the shock I felt. I was glued to the television and then when i eventually dragged myself into uni, found myself together with the postgrads i work with, glued to cnn. It was as though it was happening in my country. I hadn\'t really thought that I identified the states as so similar to Australia (even though it clearly is) but i found myself using meshing terms such as  we have to do something  and  they think they are doing the right thing  and so forth. I had never really given much thought to the idea that other cultures can be so incredibly different to our own. Even the european cultures although different in presentation tend to have similar types of values and societal norms. I was amazed when i watched the some of the muslim people celebrating their  victory  and found myself wondering how anybody could really take joy in such a tragic event. It really made me think not only about the role of culture and norms but also about general values and how the vastly different teaching people recieve, depending on their religious identity, culture and nation of origin has such a huge impact. It is as though I had believed that all people had a similar set of core values (eg don\'t kill) so to have them challenged in such a way that it cannot be denied, does make one wonder if there really is such a thing as an absolute value. A silly thought in the sense that the very thing the terrorists are trying to prove is an absolute value and yet the acts makes me question whether they exist at all or if deep down all people are utilitarian and willing to sacrafice for a cause. In a way we have seen evidence of this already with the mobilization of troops (even Australian ones, when the govt knows there is a good chance that up to 100, 000 of them will be killed in the line of duty. In a sense that is the same thing, we are willing to kill and sacrafice to protect our values of freedom and yet we condemn for them same thing. By no means am I one who agrees with the actions of the terrorists and their attempt to prove their point however it has made me reevaluate what my own values are and to what extent I would go to defend them. For instance I am against killing and murder yet i believe retailation is necessary. Where is the line? How do you make a demarcation between when killing people is  okay  in terms of war and when it is an act of terrorism?  I am finding that I am still overly verbose, it has been the topic of conversation for K and I for so long now and yet it still seems unresolved. Perhaps we are waiting for some action which will serve as closure yet i don\'t know that will come. At the time I felt shocked, even a little scared. A plane would fly over and I knew it was irrational but my thoughts were, that is flying very low. In many ways now it has all become a past event. It is sad to know that I have become numb to the reality of the event. For so long it dominated my thoughts, the airwaves and every conversation and yet it seems people have moved on so quickly that it is almost sacraligious. We had an airline collapse here in Australia towards the end of the week and I found myself feeling annoyed with the news for focusing on such a minor issue in comparison to the WTC. All the same my life has moved on and as much as it was an important event that will no doubt have many repercussions and be the impetus for a number of changes, it really hasn\'t effected me in a personal and lasting way the way it has touched those with friends or family involved. If anything it has taught be to both trust our leaders and distrust them and take a greater interest in the middle east situation and indeed the whole western world at large. Clearly it is still a current issue in my mind though as I only planned to jot down a few ideas and I can see i have written quite a bit about it. Perhaps the writing is a therapeutic benefit in itself.\"hatred\"Overwhelming sadness for all the personal loss, combined with inspiration in the validation that people care about strangers and reach out to one another during crises.  When people were gearing up for the predicted Y2K disaster, I was appalled at the number of people who expected the need to hole up in the woods with weapons and a year\'s supply of food and water to survive the resulting chaos.  At the time I felt that most people would help out their neighbors and we would all muddle through.  Watching all the courage and altruism going on during a true disaster is heartening about human nature.\"\"I haven\'t been laughing, or finding much humor  in life\"Radical islamic terroristsI am careful not to take my time here on earth for granted.I feel that it was a mark in history and something that is coming true straight out of the book of Revelation.  It was terrible what happened to people and their close ones. It is very sad.We are not fighting against flesh and blood but principalities of darkness. \"Hatred, Religion\"the terrorists. Being Bin Laden and his followers.Out of ingnorance and lack of understanding.I think i might be a little more wary of people.  As bad as that sounds.  It is not something that can be helped\"I believe that the events that occured on September 11th are truly tragedies.  I am completely shocked that something like this might happen.  To the most powerful country in the world no less.  I disagree with that fact that we retaliated, though.  It is like we stooped to their level.  Although, I do realize some sort of action needed to be taken.  I just think the whole thing is so sad.\"\"I feel that we need to do more to protect the USA, not just attack Afghanistan.  I do not feel that enough energy has been put into actually making airports safe again.  Perhaps we need to look into eliminating all carryons and other such measures and tighter security for the airline employees\"I have been watching the news more often.\"I feel that the Taliban, not the people of Afghanistan, is responsible at least in part.\"The USA is not a perfect country and we sacrifice a lot of p[eople outside of our country in order to keep our freedom.  We are a very selfish nation and it only makes sense that not everyone would like us.Misunderstanding\"Although I feel a deep sadness for all those who lost their lives or loved ones in this tragedy, at this point I feel rather removed from it.  During that week I prayed for those involved but tried to refrain from watching the terrifying photographs over and over.  We were affected somewhat by the events, a downturn in my husband\'s business, his inability to fly his small plane because it wwas grounded due to airport restrictions. We have been affected as has almost everyone by the economic downturn.  We have flown several times since then and were thankful for the increased security at the airport but annoyed by the senseless overreaction to profiling.   I am glad that women in Afganistan have regained some of the freedom.  I wish there had been a better alternative to accomplishing this.  I am against war and violence. I hold the belief that  none of us know when our lives will end and that we must live and love each day to the fullest.  I hope that others have come to that belief. \"Not much changeAll of us',4,-5,0,2,5,0,2.57,0,0,0,0,0,1.71,0.57,0,1.14,0,8.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.85,2.85,0,0,4.56,0.57,0,0.57,3.72,0,0,0,0.57,0,0.57,0.29,0,27.66,0,1.43,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,36.22,1.14,0,4.56,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,0.57,0,0,0,6.84,8.56,3.42,1.14,0,0,2.28,0,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,Female
'Jealousy\"More patient, don\'t look at planes the same... don\'t know if I will fly.  I have cancelled my vacation for the end of the month even though I was driving to my location.\"\"What a terrible, terrible tragedy. I have cried for the deceased and the injured... cheered for the heroes... hate and desire revenge on the enemy.  The enemy being those who support, plan, and put into motion the events that take/injure lives.  Before I don\'t think I ever noticed how many folks of middle eastern decent lived around me... now I can tell you how many I saw during each trip to the store or at the park...  It\'s a shame that it has done this, because I don\'t look at white, middle class males with short hair that way, after what Timothy McVeigh did to Oklahoma City.  I don\'t think I will ever look at those low flying planes above my home the same again.  I fear for what the future holds.  I fear that this can and will happen again.  I know it probably won\'t happen the same way but who knows what evil plan they are plotting next??..  I know war is necessary at this point, and I do support it. It however does not mean that I do not fear it and it\'s outcome.  What a tremendous week of emotions... shock, fear, sad, mournful, but also proud of america, happy with each life that was saved and delighted that our president is not trigger happy.\"Osama bin Laden and Sadam Huessain\"Yesterday and today I worked with five students from my advisory creating memorials downtown at the Smith Houses and the LaGuardia Houses. We are working with the Lower Manhattan Residents Relief Coalition, which includes members of Chinese Staff and Workers Association, Project Reach, and other organizations, to construct and paint the memorials, and to provide ways for the people of the community to join in, drawing and writing their messages to loved ones who died.  The kids interact with the neighbors as they walk up to them, wanting to know what it is and to contribute. One of my kids, Raju Bhuiyan, painted a message to his cousin and his cousin\'s wife, newlyweds who worked at Marsh McLennon. On top of the grief of this loss, his family is suffering hate.  When I talked with his mom, she described how she encountered aggression in people\'s eyes and gestures and in their physical presence as she went to work.  Raju\'s father is also concerned for Raju\'s safety.   His father was there when two men were shot on the 13th as they were leaving the mosque after prayers; that was outside his mosque in Church Avenue (Brooklyn).  The mosque has had to shut.  Some of our kids are witnessing this anti-Asian and anti-Muslim violence.  I also think that some of them are perpetrating it.  Others are being victimized by it, especially girls wearing chadr or salwar kameez.  Yesterday evening, visiting Shumi Hakim\'s family, who live above the mosque at 11th Street and 1st Ave, I learned that her mother and her sister have still not been outside.  She told me that she is scared to work at her Kmart job after school, and to stay for afterschool homework, but that she can stay if a teacher will walk her home. The group has built and painted two memorials.  Tomorrow, Thursday, we will go to complete the second, at the corner of Rutgers and Madison, by LaGuardia Houses.  The Project Reach counselors we are working with are amazing.  The kids said it was fun.  We got done yesterday at 8:30pm, and they were all back at 10:30 this morning in front of East Side -- from the Bronx, from Orchard Street, from Campos.  Once the second is done, the Relief Coalition has plans to construct 6 more over the weekend, into next week.   In addition, members of the Coalition are going door-to-door visiting people who are elderly, disabled, or isolated.  There is enough volunteer work for anyone who wants to participate, and wonderful people with experience to guide us in the work and the feelings.  Plus, the kids get to know the people and the offices of Project REACH as they go along, and may decide to get involved with REACH on their own.  Project REACH is the by-youth, for-youth organization that helped us set up our gay-straight alliance, the A-B Squad (as in Anti-Bias; Marc Ottaviani is coordinating staff support), last spring. Send anyone who wants to join the volunteer work to room 318 at 3pm, on Thursday and Friday. Kiran \"000\"I don\'t know.  I think it\'s interesting that after the OK City bombing the US rushed after foreign terrorists and, come to find out, it was a US citizen who was responsible.  I think it\'s important not to jump to conclusions (though clearly many people have)\"\"I don\'t feel patriotic--a reaction many of my fellow citizens seem to feel.  I do, however, feel intensely sad and mournful.  I don\'t think so much about the buildings and the attack on American symbols--I think about the lives, I think about the cell phone calls before the various crashes, I think about the pets.   I\'ve also started feeling angry--I see a lot of behavior and hear a lot of opinion that seems to deepen the cleavage between  us  and  them.   I fear this mentality will only perpetuate racism, hate, and more terror.  I\'m angry that the media showed images of Arab individuals celebrating.  I don\'t think we have reason to believe that those individuals knew the entire story--the number of lives lost, etc.  Additionally, my stomach turns when I hear how some Americans are reacting to these images--I heard one guy say he\'d like to put a bullet between that kid\'s eyes.  We\'re such hypocrites--I would bet a large sum of money that if  we  bomb/hurt/kill  them,  there will be THOUSANDS of Americans out celebrating in the streets.  But, of course,  we  will feel justified in our actions because we had a reason.  A little perspective taking might suggest that  they , too, had a reason--a reason which I think  we  need to try to understand.  I also keep asking myself,  Where are the women in all of this?   I am a woman and I feel as though the coverage of this event has distanced me from the reality.  I hear the people on the street saying,  We\'re all brothers in this,  and I hear the firefighters saying  We only call each other brother.   I don\'t know for a fact, but probability suggests there were women firefighters lost also.  The men on the PA flight tried to take over the terrorists--what were the women doing?  I can\'t be too upset about this particular flight--for all I know the women were also rebelling and I\'ve only heard about that one phone call.  I heard a piece on the radio this morning.  Four or five people were asked what they would be willing to give up to overthrow terrorism.  All four or five people were men--again, where are the women.  I\'m tired of hearing about all the heroes--I want to acknowledge the heroines. I\'m worried about my Arab peers.  I want to patronize Afghanie businesses.  I see Muslim students walking around--never alone, silent--I don\'t think they did this a few weeks ago.  There\'s a big fat elephant in my classroom and I don\'t know how to address it. I don\'t know if I want to address it. It bothers me that so many of the fund raisers are being held for the families of the firefighters and other rescue workers.  Are their lives more valuable than the thousands of people who were in the towers?  I think all the funds should be used for all the people.   In sum, I guess I just feel angry.  And I feel like I\'m outside of all of this looking in and getting angrier and more disappointed at the threat of additional hate and death.\"\"Who ever did this, I think, was desparate to get a message across.  I wonder if the person or people responsible have tried to get a message across but didn\'t feel anyone listened.  I don\'t think 19 people would willingly die if they didn\'t believe this was for a good cause--however subjective that might be.\"\"Watched tons of television, cried myself to sleep Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night, calling my friends and family just to hear their voice, feel very clingy to my husband\"I\'ve sent money to different charity organizations and I haven\'t really said anything bad about President Bush. The latter is a major change!\"1. It was a devastating thing. Both the magnitude and because it penetrated our sense of invulnerability. It was impossible not to keep thinking about all those innocent, unsuspecting people. 2. As someone who flies regularly, it made me realize that the terrorists could have taken any plane they wanted and nothing could be done about it. 3.  I had been concerned for a long time about the apparent insensitivity of the US to the plight of the Palestinians. Now, it seems like we are going to be made to pay for that insensitivity. 4. Because we can\'t identify who the enemy is, we are going to have to be vigilant. Americans had had the luxury of feeling safe and secure. No more.\"Bin Laden did it to further his religious/political agenda. The actual participants did it out of a misguided sense of what Islam is.Osama Bin Laden\"I am still feeling a bit nervous about what happened.  I tend to find myself jumping up at loud noises that I would usually ignore.  At night it is hard to go to sleep because I still see some of the horrific images that were shown on tv in my head (such as people jumping from buildings, fire and explosions,etc).  I was having nightmares up to about two days ago.  In general, I still remain very tired from both lack of sleep and stress.  I am worried about what will happen in the future, whether or not there will be a war.  I cannot say that I am in favor of a war, because I think it will only lead to further death and destruction.  There are too many scary weapons out there that culd be used against the US, so I think it would be worth the time it takes to find another solution to the problem.  I still feel a bit of sadness.  So many people died for what seemed like no reason.  My heart goes out to them and thier families.  I remain grateful that I am still here and that I have my family.  Luckily, no one I immediately know was killed.  If anything, I am hoping that we as a society will learn from this disaster.  I am hoping that I too will remember how precious life is and that I should be grateful for what I have.  Things will never be the same.  It is uplifting to me to see my community pull together to help in the rescue efforts (such as sending money, donating blood, etc).  I have noticed that people are just a little nicer to strangers than they were before.  I find myself more concious of those around me.  It is good to know that the country is pulling together.  My roommates and I joined the rest of our neighborhood in putting candles on the porches.  It helped a little to know that others cared.\"bin Laden was the person behind it.  I do think that the United States should realize the political roll it played in thiss event however.  We are not blameless.\"I pay more attention to the TV (well, I watch the news a lot more).  I have spent as much time as possible wiht friends and family.  I try not to fight over petty things anymore.  I am more aware of the feelings and needs of others.\"They feel that they were wronged in some way.  Their conviction was strong enough that they were willing to die.\"Thinking it will make them heroes, more powerful than the United States\"\"I think it was the first time I have ever felt terror.  Would it ever end, how many locations would become crash sites, how many planes were involved, where were they.  Questions like rifle shots in my brain kept popping.  The terror and shock of the images seen on TV made it almost feel like a movie, fiction but with real life characters.  The saddness and sorrow for all the victims, firemen, policemen and all the families experiencing the emptiness in their lives that evening.  I don\'t think I have stopped crying \"Much more focused on every person my life touches or encounters.  Mostly count my blessings and try to remind others of their blessings. \"We all are for not ending the threat of terrorism.  We have not stood up and let our leaders know we will not tolerate their lackadasical approach to the squelching of Sadam Hussain, Bin Ladin and all the other self proclaimed enemies of the USA. \"-more TV watching -different conversation with friends and acquaintances -extra $$ out of bank just in case -filled car with gas long before it hit emptyterroristsRight at the moment I feel like we\'re waiting for something but we don\'t know what it is...

I was scared that my family, friends and I were in danger.  By the end of the day I felt fairly secure that the attacks were over, at least for now.  What overwhelmingly scares me at the moment is the thought of war.  I am afraid that our government is going to begin a world war against the middle east.  I keep thinking that the huge majority of people in that area of the world are equally innocent as the people in the world trade center.  I don\'t believe we will ever find and destroy Osama bin Laden, I only think that thousands of innocent people are going to die.  Many of those people are going to be more Americans, but even so, what makes American lives more valuable than the lives of people anywhere else in the world.  I don\'t think we should start a war, but I don\'t know what else to do either.  I agree that if we don\'t have some kind of reaction there is likely to be more terrorism.  Maybe that reaction should simply be to stand together, improve security, and go after only the guilty, no those who have the same religion as the guilty.  It scares me that so many Americans are so angry, and that the president doesn\'t seem to have any thoughts of peace.\"\"I look at planes differently, which is odd because I grew up next door to an airport, so I never even noticed them before.  I check the news every morning.\"Osama bin Ladenanger toward our country and our prosperity\"As an American I am deeply saddened by the loss of lives and the devastation of our landmarks.  I am not surprised something like this could happen here.  A major problem in our Nation is the inability to understand and communicate with people who do not look like us - and I must explain that  us  means white and usually Christian.  As a Black American, I have watched with a terrible foreboding, the growing anger of non-Christian people of color thoughout the world geared toward this beloved country of mine. Even today, as I read of the men who were told to leave an airplane because of the color of their skin, I cringe.  No one asked white Christian males to get off the airplanes of America when McVeigh blew up the building in Oklahoma.  We must learn to communicate throughout the world - with our friends and our enemies for the safety of all.  \"Men in power throughout the worldHatred and personal paranoianone',4,-5,0,2,5,0,2.89,0,0.72,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,0.36,0,11.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0,4.69,2.89,0,0.36,3.61,0.72,0,0,8.31,0,0,0,0.72,0.36,0,2.53,0,44.05,0.72,0.72,0,0,0,0,0.72,0,53.07,4.33,0,4.33,0,0,0,0.72,0,1.44,0,1.44,0,0,0,17.33,9.02,2.89,0.36,0,0,6.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,5.42,Female
'\"My initial feeling was sorrow - deep sorrow - at the loss of so many lives.  Without any thought about it, I broke into crying and I cried deeply for more than an hour as I watched the horror unfolding before my eyes on the television.  Then I felt fear and a sense of threat - what if there were more terrorists still in the skies?  What if they came to my city?  Maybe I should have kept the children home instead of letting them go to school.  What would happen if I were separated from them?  Next, I felt angry that someone could so disregard basic  laws (to me) respecting individuals\' lives, property, and lifestyle - that certain people felt they had the right to take away the sense of security felt by citizens of our country.  My anger was intensified by seeing cheering Palestinian children on the television.  I really felt that I could not understand people who could react to such devastation and horror in this way.  After this, I started to feel numb.  I felt that way for several days.  It was only yesterday that I started to feel more in tune with my surroundings.  Now, I am pondering what is next - could the horror ahead be as bad as what we have already seen?  How can we make sure something like this will never happen again, or can we ever be sure of that?  I certainly feel anger - ire, hatred - at bin Laden.  I couldl squeeze his neck with my hands. (Trust me when I tell you I have never done that to anyone or even seriously contemplated it before.)\"A confederation of international terrorist organizations led by Osama bin Laden.I cancelled a trip I was supposed to take.  I am definitely watching more television than I ever have before!To further their own personal and philosophical agenda.\"Although I have strong feelings about my relationship with a higher power, I am not particularly religious.  I blame this in part on extremist segments of all religions.  I feel like there is a strong encouragement in many religions for followers to see the differences rather than the similarities between people.  I also blame it on human nature and physiology, in that we all have some violent/angry streak, especially when threatened.  I also blame it on the polarizing and dichotomizing language used by various nations\' and groups\' leaders, the same kind in which President Bush is engaging. \"\"My first thoughts when it happened were of my beautiful 17-year-old daughter, who is in her senior year in high school almost 2000 miles away from where I live.  All I wanted to do was to put my arms around her and hold her close to me and reassure her.  What does a person that age think when they see this happening in the world?  Overall, I have felt a deep and at times overwhelming sense of grief and sadness all week, about the world, about humankind in general.\"Feeling threatened.  Uninhibited drive for dominance.\"Slower, sadder, cry at the drop of a hat.  It\'s been a week now since it happened, and this seems to be improving.\"more aware of my surroundings and of people and watch a bit more newsfanatacism0osama ben laden\"I believe what I read in the free press, that an organized network of Islamic terrorists that includes Osama bin Laden is responsible.\"\"I don\'t understand why the individual hijackers would do this. My understanding of why the organization would do this is because it wants to increase its control over the Arab world and perhaps eventually the rest of the world as well. In my mind, their vision of the future is unacceptable in part because it is a totalitarian, inhumane vision that would undo centuries of political, social, and economic development. I am also personally threatened by the idea that women in particular could be forced to give up their freedom.\"\"The attacks of September 11 caused me tremendous shock, great anxiety, grief and sadness. Even though I have a Ph.D. in social psychology and my dissertation was in intergroup relations, my worldview was inadequate to understand why the terrorists attacked as they did. After a great deal of soul-searching, information gathering, and analysis, I have come to understand the world differently. For the first time, I  believe that the US has enemies who will attack us as long as they are able and as long as the world looks to them as it does now. I now believe we must continue to strengthen a global coalition against totalitarian regimes whether they be cultural or religious, and I am tremendously saddened by the military action in Afghanistan yet I will support it until a more effective intervention is realized.  To those who would try to understand the  events  of September 11 through self-examination and without attribution of malicious intent on the part of the hijackers and their organization(s) I would point out that they are the perpetrators, and their targets are the victims, of these attacks. To look inward for an explanation is understandable. Just as a battered woman blames herself for her broken jaw, blaming the US for the terrorists\' actions gives one a sense of control over future events at a time when these attacks have made us feel helpless. The danger of this approach is that it leads away from, even argues against the course of action necessary to disable the terrorist organizations and prevent future attacks.  \"\"I pay more attention to world events, all world events, than I did before. My bubble is burst.  what does  patriotic  mean? If it means  my country right or wrong  then no, I don\'t feel patriotoc. If it means I strongly identify with my country and with Americans as a group then yes, I feel more patriotic than I did.  Another comment: how can you interpret these data without any information about minority status of respondents, religious, cultural, or ethnic? I believe that you are genuinely interested, or I would not have taken so much time to respond, but I will be quite wary of your interpretations of these data--they\'re no more scientific than the on-line CNN polls.\"0to get attentionI think osama bin laden is innocent or he got brainwashed by that chines dude that is trying to start a war with the un ited states 0\"I feel fairly certain the evidence points to bin Laden, but I would not bet my life on it.\"\"I fear flying, for a few weeks any sound of a fire alarm or emergency vehicle scared me, I am watching more television and listening to the radio to get updates.\"To incite the US into an unwinnable war.\"The first thing I reacted to was the sense of complete vulnerability that I\'m left with following these attacks.  It is almost unfathamable that my routine life is so fragile, when it feels so stable and permanent.  I could have had my family members killed, I could have been on an airplane one day by sheer  luck  and never have the opportunity to see my son grow.  It took a while for me to focus on the  everydayness  of my life.  Now, a month after the attacks, that has returned to some extent. Now I am left wondering what the hell we are doing as a country... I\'m primarily concerned that we are out seeking  justice  in a way that will only add to the tragedy of the situation rather than truly prevent such a reoccurence.  The velocity with which the US began military attacks on Afghanistan concerns me.  I find it difficult to see what the point of these attacks are; although I understand the propaganda that is being transmitted daily is supposed to assure me we are on top of things and  getting the bad guys.   I want the people responsible to be punished, killed even, but I am very uncertain we are actually accomplishing that.  In addition, I fear we are playing right into a game plan.  Americans are not known for their patience.  These people planned the attacks for over a decade; and in three weeks we respond with bombs.  Was that not a predictable response?  Of course!  There was no question that such an affront would result in military action, that might incite a tremendous battle both in the middle east and on our home front.  We are a nation of privilege; we do not know war (I speak mostly for the  younger  generation, of which I am part).  We idealize Rambo and Hollywood portrayals of action and violence, having no memory of the tragedies that accompany these.  We are not concerned with understanding the WHY of the attacks, only the WHO and ARE THEY DEAD YET? I cannot bring myself to fly the flag on my car, as so many here have done.  I grieve privately for my own friends who\'ve lost loved ones in the tragedies.  I have family in DC that were, thank goodness, safe.  I have volunteered to help those who grieve in our school mental health clinic.  But I cannot endorse the sort of testosterone-driven, violent, impulsive action we\'ve taken.  Who are we really fighting?  The whole point of terrorism is that it has no identifiable roots and borders.  We are worse off than Vietnam soldiers were in the Viet Cong!  We are out in the open, an open target, trying to shoot an invisible enemy.  No one here wins in that situation. I fear flying home for the holidays, although to drive would mean more than 20 hours.  I hate this.\"\"Bin laden and his associates. However, the US has to reflect on its foreign policiy. Noone is truly innocent; there needs to be refelction on the part of the  supernations \"\"I was truly shocked by what happened last Tuesday. It was shocking to me that a plane could be used as a bomb. I was truly devasted at the loss of life and those who had lsot loved ones, particularly the fireifighters. However, I was  not surprised that terrorism had finally reached the US and I believed that Bin Laden was invovled. I am a Brit livign in Colorado and lived in London for 6 years during the IRA bombings. I was particularly upset by the tragedy because it reminded me of some the London bombings particularly those in the City. \"\"BIn Laden believes that the US is the devil incarnate and that through ridding the world of US citizens or by keeping the US out of the Middle East, the world would be a purer place. \"My behavior has not changed. \"When I first heard it, I immediately thought of the horror that those involved must have experienced.  I told myself that it was over, within minutes, I heard that the Pentagon had been hit.  I have spent time in D.C. and stayed one week within about a mile of the Pentagon. Within minutes, the experience got even more personal when the Pa. plane went down only a few miles from my husband\'s birth place. Next, was the overwhelming sense of emotion I experienced as the second WTC tower came down.  I had seen the first, and just kind of accepted it, I guess it was because I had numbed myself.  But when the second came down, I actually stopped and said a prayer.  I then found myself sitting and listening, but not watching the television. After this, my thoughts began to turn toward my family and children. I called my husband to make sure he was o.k. We are both federal employees and work on opposite sides of town.  My children, I felt were safe at their schools. But as a federal employee at one of the few agencies that remained open that day I felt a sense of uneasiness. Next I thought about my two nieces, one who works near the Pentagon, and the other who spends much of her time in Manhattan--where were they, were they o.k?  Fortunately they were both fine. I went back to my office and sat at my desk, as I looked out the window, I saw the flags--now at half staff.  A sense of forlorn over took me.  Periodically throughout the day, I would see local police and the fire marshall enter and leave the grounds. As the day progressed, patients called, and we talked.  I helped them process their own issues.  When I got home, my 13 year old son was there full of questions and asking,  Did they find out who did it yet ?  A simple no was all I could answer.   At one point, I was part of a group that was on standby to be sent in to do critical incident debriefing.  I wasn\'t so threatened by the thought of going, but I also knew that if I did go, I wouldn\'t be the same upon my return.  I called my parents and a close friend who I consider my  other mother  and told them to prepare that I might have to go.  I guess I was actually preparing myself. As the days have passed, I have spent much of my time assisting my patients in processing the horror.  I still feel a sense of horror for the families of those who are lost.  I anticipate that most may never be found.  How tragic.  I feel fearful when I think about the fact that this is not over.  I think about my children.  I lived through Vietnam.  I see patients daily who experienced permanent trauma from Vietnam and Desert Storm.  I don\'t want that for my children. I hope and pray they are not drafted. On the other hand, I feel as if I can\'t allow myself to be overtaken by the fear.  I let my life move on.  I am a little concerned by a trip that my husband has to make to Boston this fall, but I also realize that while the events of this month have diminished me, I cannot let them stop me.  I guess this moving on is a way to deal with the shock and denial of the whole affair.  When I her two hour news cast that focus solely on the events of 9/11, I feel angry--let us move on and just hush. I ask the Lord to protect me and those I love.\"\"I really feel that this is in part a result of jealousy.

I also realized that ANYTHING can happen, even to us good people.  Belief in a just world, NO LONGER appears in my book. \"\"Actually, in the beginning I didn\'t even believe it really happened.  My mother woke me up at about 9:45 a.m. and told me what happened just an hour earlier.  I was groggy so I didn\'t respond well, but I tried to go back to sleep and I couldn\'t do it after I realized what she had really said.  I watched the television all day and didn\'t even notice how late it was getting.  Later on that day I went outside to feed my cats and realized how quiet it was outside.  It was like the whole world stopped.  The usual airplanes that I hear weren\'t flying overhead and I couldn\'t hear the children running and playing at the park.  It was an  eerie  kind of quiet.  \"Yes\"I would have to start off by saying my prayers are with each and every individual that was effected by this tragic event. Maybe a mom was lost or dad, sister, brother, niece, nephew, cousin, uncle, aunt, grandparent, co-worker, employee, etc... I have lost many family members in the recent years and I can sympathize with a tragic event. My sister was in a car accident killing her and my brother-in-law and today I am still greiving! Take the amount of people that lost their lives mutiply that by two or three then you have the number of people that are having a terrible time with this. Every time I think about it I can\'t help but cry for as long as the thoughts keep going through my mind. I do and will say a prayer for those families, friends and so forth for that day and for the rest of my life. I believe that is the best way I can give my help because I know a man named Jesus that answers my prayers. He\'ll not only answer mine but he will also answer yours.

Whilst I don\'t believe we should let terrorism put us in to a position of fear, it\'s obviously easier to say that when I don\'t live in the U.S.\"\"You often hear people talk about an event and say they remember perfectly what they were doing when they heard about it. September 11th brought that experience to me. The moment I saw the events that unfolded in the US (delayed because of time differences) is frozen in time and I can remember ridiculously minute and irrelevant details about it. It seemed to me immediately that all sense had gone from the world. I\'ve heard people say they felt like they were watching a movie but I don\'t get that at all. It\'s reality was quite apparent to me. I\'ve grown up amongst terrorism (in London) but never ever could have imagined anything as abhorrent as this series of acts. External to events, in that I\'m not an American, I don\'t reside in the U.S., of course my feelings have no comparison to those directly affected by this attack. Even so, it affected me deeply, I cried, I felt numb to the core. And what really made me sick was the TV coverage of young children rejoicing in the streets of the Middle East at the news of the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans. When you see such hatred bred into young children, you think what future is there for peace? Showing such images polarises people\'s attitudes. When you see such scenes, you feel you don\'t want to know what their troubles are, no matter how deserving of our attention they were. You see hatred and that\'s exactly what it invokes in response. It\'s widely touted that the attack on the U.S. was an attack on all free countries of the world. It may be true that the atack has far reaching consequences for us all but, i nthe end, it is the U.S. alone that is hurting. Whilst the rest of us can share their struggle, we can never in reality share their pain. In an ideal world we\'d want to take action and be reassured that such an event will never occur again. I doubt very much that such we will ever be able to guarantee that.  I have to say I\'m not really happy with what I\'ve written above. It sounds cliched. It doesn\'t adequately convey everything I felt and thought about the event but then I don\'t think words will ever be enough.\"I don\'t think the picture is as simple as we are led to believe. I think there has to be an intricate network of different organisations behind such an elaborate attack.\"They\'d want you to think that they did this out of commitment to their cause, that they were martyrs but it\'s more than about a cause. It\'s about pure hatred, evil and a lack of basic humanity. \"\"Insanity, desire for power\"\"Osama Bin Laden, in conjunction with other terrorists\"\"I still cannot believe it happened. Yesterday a newscaster said it, but it is exactly what I think of it  first we saw the unbelievable(1st plane striking tower), then we watched the unthinkable(2nd plane).  Like millions of other people I watched the second plane hit it live and I watched both towers fall, which was even harder than the actual planes hitting for me. My sister was in the other room when the 2nd tower fell. I said  I think the other tower just fell  she said  noooo.  I said  you\'re probably right, its just very smoky now.  I hope I never have to feel what I felt next when the about 30 seconds later the newscaster came on and said he thought the second tower just fell. Then shortly after that he confirmed the horrendous belief. I also think the public is being lied to now by officials about the death toll. I think it is going to be close and maybe over 10,000. I think that it is ok at this point(the deception) simply because the horror of the event is so horrible and in my opinion almost too much for many to take. The only factor that they may be able to control in order to stop even more mass hysteria is to make it seem it wasn\'t as bad as it could have been.  Personally I think Osama Bin Laden should have been hunted long before this. Yet im not so sure he is the only one that is responsible and not knowing makes me feel even more powerless than ever before. I am also scared for my brother who graduated boot camp 2 weeks ago. he never wanted to join the army but he was encouraged to join because he hadn\'t finished high school.

I am scared for my children--I do not want them to have to grow up in a world where there is such hatred. I do not want them scared. It is hard to believe that they will be able to be at peace in this world when I as an adult am not capable of being at peace. I am scared and nervous--especially of what is to come. I live near an airforce base. Many of the highschool friends I still am in contact with are in the armed forces. It is just so sad that so many people fail to see what a small world we have become.

I also worry that this could bring out the worst in some people (ex:  a dark-skinned man being killed in Phoenix recently.)  I hope that better tendencies will emerge, but hate and fear are strong emotions and don\'t usually bring out the best in people.  I also don\'t have a lot of confidence in Pres. Bush and I am worried that he is the person leading the country through this.  I\'m not sure he\'s capable of something that requires so much diplomacy and strategic thinking.  I am heartened, though, by the demonstrations of support from all around the world and hope that this will reverse some of Bush\'s tendencies towarad isolationism.  \"\"Probably Osama bin Laden and his cohorts, although I think America itself bears some responsibility because of our foreign policy decisions.\"\"I am more protective of my children.

She had an appointment on September 10 in a building across from the World Trade Center and on September 12 in the World Trade Center. Friends and colleagues report similar chance events that saved the lives of people close to them.  The complexities involved in stopping these groups and preventing future calamities seem overwhelming. I suspect that this was only the beginning of the horrors we will face.  Like many around the world, I mourn the loss of life, wake up early with anxiety and bad dreams, and view the scenes with horror. I worry about the bellicosity of the present administration, and the consequences of impulsive action.  I am deeply moved by the response of the American people. The courage and generosity of the firefighters, police and countless volunteers make me proud to be an American. We seem more kind to one another and more generous than we ever have before. \"More cautious and anxiousHatred toward the American culture and government and revenge for past actions of the govenment',3,-5,0,2,5,0,2.03,0,1.01,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,1.01,0,10.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,3.04,0,0,14.19,0,0,0,10.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.04,0,51.69,0,8.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,68.41,4.05,0,18.24,0,2.03,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.67,16.72,0,0,0,0,8.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,4.05,Female
'religious fanatics\"I come from a family of law-enforcement people, from police, federal agents federal prosecutors judges. I see how it has changed them. My husband died of cancer 5 years ago, I think that gives me a lot of sympathy for the survivors. The whole thing is so terribly painful, and it has only just begun.\"\"home more, spend less, sad\"hatred and brainwashingBin Laden\'s terrorist regime the Taliban\"I think the US government should use caution in planning any future responses to the attack. They should also educate the American public more honestly  about the causes behind the intense hatred many people in Arabic countries have for the US (reasons such as the US selling arms to militant groups for years under the guise they will fight communism, ie, Soviets; putting barbarians in power (Iraq) and later bombing them because they disagree with current American policies). I think most Americans are completely unware of events outside their country which have lead up to support of terrorism in many Muslim countries. I think the US people should be told why these feelings exist so they can understand that support for these acts is not just hate or evilness on the part of Muslims. In many cases people in those countries are being fed propaganda, but there is some legitimate basis for their mistrust of the US government. That said, I think the US government should continue to try to get cooperation from all allies and world governments in the fight against terrorism. Any legitimate government in the world with a concern for the wealthfare of its people does not tolerate violence directed at innocent people. Terrorism is just that. A broad sweeping policy of police/law enforcement, intervention, intelligence gathering, IT survellience, economic sanctuations and/or support where needed, social reform, and good old fashioned PR should be used to fight this  war on terrorism . Sending in troops may be necessary to locate terrorist camps and for reconnaissance, and even for attack, evacuation of civilians or peace-keeping, but mass bombing or  attacks is not the answer, in spite of the  we\'ll get \'em,   you better watch out   might makes right  sentiment running through America right now. Part of the problem that lead to this escalation lies in the failure of our government to create any sort of political understanding between western cultures and middle eastern ones. Adding fuel to the fire will not put out the flames.  The US needs to be strong, determined, smart and consistent in its approach. If we act on that premise, the US will receive full support from around the world. Angry reliation, un-informed bombing and hatred -mongering will not win this  war .  \"They want to provoke America into attacking Islam so they can get support from Muslims in a  war  that proves America is evilnone\"I can\'t help feeling that, horrible as it is and totally innapropriate as a response, that the USA must have provoked the ttack in some way. I\'ve heard aboput the suffering caused in Iraq and other places, and worry that similar attacks could take place in AUstralia. The attack was cruel and vicious. Why do people have to do these things?  But attacking the whole of Afghanistan to try to get to one person is as stupid as attacking the whole of Italy and destroying Rome because the Mafia are from Italy and some of them are still there. I wish wish wish that more women were in charge. Things wouldn\'t have gotten as bad then, I\'m sure. \"\"I may not be able to have my honeymoon in he USA next year. Selfish, but true.

It frightens me to think that there are people who hate us so much, they would spend years and sacrifice their lives to try to break us.\"\"September 11th was the day I became an adult.  Even though I was already 22 when it happened, and was to turn 23 just 8 days later, it was on that day that I felt myself shedding my child\'s view of the world and taking on an adult perspective of the events that occur around us.  The phrase  loss of innocence  may be a cliche, but it describes that day for me as surely as it does for millions of others the world over.  I had never before felt threatened within the walls of the United States, and now I did.

I just do not understand how anyone would want to put that many people\'s lives at stake, including their own. These must have been some really screwed up people to do something like this. I was very scared for those people that day and wanted to cry for them. I remember thinking, this is it it is nothing but down hill from here for our country. I was so scared that a HUGE war was going to break out becase of these few people who did this. I thought the world would end or everthing would be in caos from here on out because crashing into the World Trade Center is a huge word basically saying we are mad at your country!\"A group of many people who have been brain-washed from the time they were children.  They hate westerners and they don\'t even know why.\"Because they have no respect for life.  Everyone has a different way of interpreting the Bible (or Koran, in this case) and they have done so without taking into consideration how the world has changed.  They believe that we are satan, because our beliefs are different.\"\"At first I was very depressed and spent hours in front of the TV, watching the news.  I felt helpless for not being there to lend a hand, but as I watched from abroad how America united, I felt so proud and I wanted more than anything to hang out a flag and scream at the top of my lungs that I am an American and I am proud.  \"\"At first I was incredulous, and then as it began to sink in that it was real, not a movie, I became very sad and shortly after that (maybe a day later) I became very angry.  I don\'t know anyone that was injured or killed in the attack, but it was if it were my own family.  I\'m an American, but have lived outside of the States for most of the past 14 years.  I\'ve felt the dislike and disapproval of people from many other countries towards ours and I\'ve always tried to be open-minded about what they say.  There have been times when I\'ve wondered what\'s gone wrong with our society, when you hear so many stories of crime on the news, etc. but never have I understood our society nor been more proud to be an American than I am now, after the attacks.  People from Socialist countries think our government is cruel because they don\'t force us to pay more taxes in order to have more social benefits for those less fortunate and I\'ve come to realize that we don\'t need the government to tell us what to do with our money.  So many people have donated their money as well as their time, blood, food, clothes... you name it, it\'s been donated by Americans.  WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY, FILLED WITH GREAT, CARING, UNSELFISH PEOPLE.  We\'re the only country in the world that is inhabited by every different religion imaginable and yet there is no war.  Most countries can\'t even have two different religions and live in peace.  I am sad and angry that this has happened, but I believe that good comes out of everything and the world is seeing what a great nation we are.  It\'s definitely an eye-opener for many.\"\"First of all, confusion.  How did this happen here?  Sadness that is covered by layers of fog.  Disorientation.  From one day to the next we were in great danger and oh so vulnerable.  The unimaginable became reality.  It\'s so difficult to absorb the size of it, the results, the fact that it actually happened.  I couldn\'t tear myself away from t.v. and newspaper coverage and felt, by this last weekend, that my head would burst from taking in all the imformation.  But I feel that I need to know everything I can about this.  And there is endless information -- about the perpetrators, about the terrorist networks, the victims, the heroes, the families of victims and heroes, the opinions, the political. As a New Yorker I feel that I am in good hands with Rudy Guiliani, Schumer, Clinton, even Pataki.  But I have very little confidence in President Bush and his advisors.  I don\'t think our thinking is subtle and smart enough.  This is highly disturbing, not feeling that the executive branch of the government is up to the task of protecting citizens. And how will we rebound from this? Everything has shifted.  My challenge is finding meaning in what I do.  It was not always easy before this.  Now it\'s doubly hard.\"I\'ve spent a tremendous amount of time reading the papers and watching news shows.  I haven\'t been able to read for pleasure.

All of the sorrow, tragedy, fear and misfortune of other countries has now been visited upon us. My bags were searched before I entered museums in London; in Egypt you cannot enter a hotel or any public place without first going through security checkpoints and armed guards were everywhere. We now get to feel as the rest of the world feels--vulnerable. What happened was a tragedy beyond comprehension, but think of the years we have lived in bliss while many parts of the world lived in terror. I want to feel safe again, but that will not happen until ALL of the world is safe. Why is Osama so upset? Because we are in Mecca. Why are we in Mecca? Because of oil. Let\'s wean ourselves from our dependance on fossil fuels and stop driving our obnoxious SUV\'s! I do not hear our leaders addressing the root cause of  the hatred of the U.S. We are not saints. We need to look at things from another person\'s point of view for once. This is a new kind of war, and it will take a new kind of strategy, including taking a long hard look at our behavior as a country. We need vision, not the stale old way of doing things that have created the problems we now face; an enemy that is dying to kill us.\"0\"I feel more loving toward my fellow citizens and probably am more polite, e.g., while driving or in the store.  I\'m prioritizing tasks better at work, to spend more time with my family.\"\"I was not at all surprised.  I wondered why terrorists did not attack within the US sooner.  I fear chemical and biological attacks. I was not really afraid until I heard about an island-turned peninsula in a post-soviet republic, that has on it massive amounts of biological and chemical weapons, and no security. I hope this brings the US people and our leaders to a deeper understanding of our dependence on other countries, and our moral obligation to cooperate for good, not just when our immediate interests are at stake, for instance, in addressing pollution.\"probably bin laden (sp)\"lots of people have evil, destructive desires.  these can get fueled and can seem justified to the perpetrator, by everyday bad behavior on the part of others.\"',5,-5,0,2,5,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0.86,0.86,0.86,0,11.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.56,0.86,0,0.43,6.84,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,1.28,0,41.51,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.81,4.28,0,6.84,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.4,4.3,0,2.14,0,0,7.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,1.71,0,Female

The ripples of this event are far-reaching and long-lasting...more than we can even wrap our brains around at this time.  As an American, I feel a sense of naivete and optimism has been taken away that can never be replaced.  As a world citizen, I have a better perspective about how many others have lived for decades.  In trying to figure out how to deal with this, I am left with the feeling that taking out individual terrorists (e.g., Osama Bin Laden) will do nothing but make things worse and that we need to be honest with ourselves and our government and look at the ways in which we have contributed to a world that has fostered such unspeakable terrors.\"\"expression, trying to get a message across, or even revenge.\"They haven\'t changed.\"I was in Orlando, Fla at the moment of the attacks, at first my reaction was of complete shock, i thought a plane had crashed into one of the towers...in that moment the other plane hit the 2nd tower! I could not believe my eyes. When everything was over (if I can even say that) I was angry, shocked, and moved for those people that has lost their lives and those who had lost friends and family. I felt so many things at first that its hard to explain, after about a week or even a few days the only thing I felt was sadness for everyone.\"The Taliban    At first the actuality of the events did not really bother me. At the time of the attack I was in the Bronx at school. I was more worried about getting home and if we had school the next day over everything else.It seemed to be more than a juicy gossip scandal rather than the loss of thousands of lives. I remember waiting to see what was going to happen. All the travel to Manhattan had been severed so it was kind of exiciting waiting to see how I could get home. Then I got scared. The streets were quet and evey kind of cop in uniform was on the street. Then the national gaurd was flying in the air. The aircraft made so much noise that everytime one flew by we thought we were being attacked again. Then I got home and it was all over the television on every channel for like a week. I knew it was sad butI was glad no one I knew was in the tragedy. It slowly got to me soon I was not able to watch tv while the news was on.i Thought that if I was a pshycic I would have warned the FBI and got everyone out. Then I would be a hero.

I never thought I would see a day like this in my lifetime.  My generation has always felt rather apathetic about America in general and very safe and secure (at least from other countries or terrorists attacking us).  I cried every day for the first week and didn\'t take the TV off of CNN for about 6 days.  I didn\'t even know anyone who was directly affected except for a couple of friends who were evacuated from their homes or offices briefly.  It hasn\'t made me feel less safe but it has definitely made me think more about the U.S. role in the world and on how lucky I am to live in such a great nation.  I am glad to see the nation pulling together and forgetting about partisanship.\"\"Because they believe that as long as their God is on their side, evil is acceptable.

Just watching it on the tv was like watching a Hollywood movie.  That night I went to bed and when I woke up the next morning, I thought that it was just a bad dream.

I sense a renewed patriotism across the country, a united front against this attack and others like it.  I believe that there will be a spiritual revival in this country and we will turn back to the way that God intended this country to be;  free, brave, and one family.\"\"I tell my loved ones that I love them more often.  I\'m still going on all the trips I had planned before, but now I\'m planning on getting to the airport earlier.  I\'ll also be more careful in packing my bags than I used to be.

They hate our religious and person freedom, and they think that they have the right and the responsibility to destroy it.  They want us out of the Middle East altogether.  They think that we should have absolutely no influence on any Muslims anywhere.  They don\'t see us as human; they see us as monsters and devils who are out to destroy their way of life, even though they\'re the ones attacking ours.\"\"I\'m still in disbelief that anyone could be evil enough to do something like this.  Part of me wants to bomb Afghanistan back into the stone age, but the more rational part of me (the part that\'s in control) supports President Bush\'s more measured and reasonable response.  I don\'t feel safe anymore -- but I also don\'t worry about my own safety.  I worry about my family and friends, many of whom are far away and some of whom work for the federal government in sensitive areas that any terrorist would love to disrupt. Although my initial reaction was and still is shock, grief, and anger, I\'m also amazed at the outpouring of kindness and support, mostly within America.  The stories of the firefighters, the victims who carried other victims, the outpouring of love and support throughout the country are wonderful things to see and hear.  Unfortunately, there\'s the other side of that as well.  Prejudice and attacks against Arabs and Muslims within this country are unforgivable -- we should focus on the individuals responsible for the terrorism, not on the racial or religious group from which they come. At first the support from outside the country was also remarkable, but now I\'m hearing more and more pacifists who don\'t understand that some things -- such as freedom, a republican form of government, and our right to live securely within our borders -- really are worth fighting for.  Once again, I\'m becoming disappointed with most of the rest of the world.  They don\'t seem to think logically about what\'s necessary for our defense; all they think about is  bombing is bad.   They\'re overly simplistic in their analysis of the situation. \"Osama bin Laden and his henchmen; the Muslim clerics who preach hate (not the ones who don\'t preach hate); the Taliban who need their people to hate someone else so they don\'t rise up against them\"I am deeply saddened by the numerous deaths caused by the attack on Sept 11th. I am afarid taht this will trigger an retaliatory response from the US out of a need to show how powerful teh US is and that will anger the mulim world even more than it is already.  There is a risk that the Muslims will get even more inflamed against the West, specially the US, than they currently are and because most of them are poor in comparaison with the Western world, they don\'t have much to lose except their  dignity, and respect and will stop at nothing to show that they are the righteous,  God is on their side, and that they will win.   So if both side are strongly determined to show the other side how powerful they are, it is a recipe for disaster.  This time the risks are greater than before because of potential use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. I also see this as a unique opportunity to try a different approach to  conflict resolution: try to show mercy instead of might, help Afghanistan instead of punish, show respect and concern for justice instead of automatically protect our economic and startegic and logistic interest in the Middle East. It is time to change the type of response to attacks because the stakes are too high and because we claim we are more democratic, free, and sensitive to human life than the Muslim are, it is time to show that it is true. If we say we are Christians, and Christ said,  offer the other cheek  then  it is time to try that instead of the old aggressive reactions.\"\"I talk a lot more about fears, doubts, confusion, benefits and disvantages of various types of actions, with a lot more people.  One positive outcome is that people talk more. I am also more sensitive to how people of Middle East origin are treated.\"\"Both sides, Bin Laden because of fanatism, the US  becasue of narrow mindedness about evonomic and  cultural imbalances in the world\"To show that they deserve to be paid attention to and  cannot be discounted.\"I am shocked by the scale of the attack...the number of lives lost, level of destruction.  I am also very aware and of concerned about the long-term effects on many thousands of people,  not just those who have lost family, friends, co-workers, but also the many witnesses to the  event either on site or via the extensive media coverage. The potential for post-traumatic stress reactions in such vast numbers of people is worrying as many will not understand what is happening to them and will not necessarily seek help.  Keeping all of the above in mind and recognising the need for finding the means to prevent  any further terrorist attacks, I am extremely concerned by the Bush administration\'s war rhetoric. So much of what is being said is paralleling decisions that are made under the cloud of groupthink. Janis\'s analysis of earlier American decisions e.g. Bay of Pigs, need to be kept in mind when decisions are being made. All points of view need to be considered not just those that fit the  hawk  mentality. The enemy, whoever it turns out to be cannot be considered in stereotypically simplistic terms. The role of American foreign policy over the last decade has to be looked at to see how it has contributed to the level of anger directed at America. \"I\'ve become more aware of personal prioritieshate and frustration with a superpower that has dominated so manybin Laden and /or those associated with him',4,-5,0,2,5,0.43,1.7,0,0,0.85,0,0,3.41,0,0,1.7,0,14.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.81,2.56,0,0.43,7.67,0,0,0,4.26,0,0,0,0.43,1.7,0,0.43,0,57.09,0,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,66.03,6.82,0,8.52,0,0.85,0,0,0,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,23.85,8.94,5.11,1.7,0,0,7.67,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.7,Female

The first few days after the attack normal life felt surreal and unimportant, going through the motions. I found myself stopping when I said something that involved the future, realizing I had no idea if plans would be viable, what would be going on, a great feeling of uncertainty.  Later, after personal stories appeared on the media, I cried with most of them. People keep talking about anger, but all i feel is sadness--sadness for the misguided people who believed in something enough to do this, sadness for the victims and their friends and families, and sadness for what is to come--for there appears to be a lot more tragedy in store. I don\'t want to bomb Afghanistan, or target Moslems, I don\'t want any more people to be hurt. But I think the people who were behind this won\'t stop there. I\'m confused about what the right response is, and who it should be aimed for.

And I like dark humor. But this was just too low, too impossible, too cruel. Once I realized what had happened to the Twin Towers, I *knew* what had happened on the Pennsylvania flight. They were still reporting it as a crash, uncertain causes. I have survived my own traumas, so I experienced dissociation. Not denial as in the first seconds, but refusal to think about anything. I was at home alone and cried a little, then went out for a drive with one of my dogs. Things seemed normal on the streets of my town so I got back more in touch with my feelings and thoughts. I\'m very analytical. And very empathic. I also have too much knowledge of too many subjects so I anticipated the horrendous death toll, including the many rescue personnel. I worried about the smaller scale things that wouldn\'t be addressed: the lost pets, the rescue dogs, the need for ironworkers in the wreckage. The ironworkers don\'t get paid as the other rescuers do. Within nine or ten hours, I was concerned about my coworkers who are from India and Iran, and even the medium toned Puerto Ricans. I wrote an email immediately the next morning at work to upper management to tell them we must be prepared to do anything to reassure and protect our coworkers from any jokes or other backlash. I was not scared at any time, just horrified. I still am not scared, though I think I have a grasp of biological and chemical warfare that blissfully eludes many around me. My sleeping has been disturbed and I cry every day. Sometimes I curl up in a ball and tuck my head in. This is not uncommon reaction to tragedy for one who has experienced trauma and already has PTSD. My therapist called to cancel my appointment on the 12th because she was debriefing pilots. I was concerned for her because she was using a land line from home to call me, even though we had known each other for years. I considered it as a violation of her privacy that I could hear her children in the background. I was also concerned for her. Who would be there to debrief her? She assured me that she was a regular part of a therapists\' circle and would be coping with the help of others.  I coincidentally had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next week. She talked to me for a few minutes. She\'s Pakistani. She recommended that I increase my prozac and my klonopin until I got the crying jags and sleep disturbances in control.  My therapist called me a day later to reschedule. She was very busy, but the shrink told her I was in serious need of seeing her. We did and everything is fine, sort of.  I talked a bit of my plans to go back to school even with the change to our society. We talked some about her crisis counseling. I told her I feel as if there is no future, since I can\'t anticipate what it might be. She said that is very common to trauma survivors. Take one day at a time. So I am.\"\"I am no more vigilant than I always am. I am more inclined to voice my concerns, though. A man appeared to be shoplifting in a grocery store and I quietly told the checker I knew that his behavior was suspicious.\"\"I am definitely patriotic toward my country, and I have also started to watch the news more often than I normally would.\"\"When I initially heard the news of the first plane hitting the world trade center, I thought that the ordeal was just that something had gone wrong with the plane or its captain. When I learned that the situation was the result of a terrorist hijacking, my heart jumped into my throat. I thought, how could someone do such an in-humane thing?  I was then worried  that some other act of terrorism moght happen soon.  The entire week after, I was glued to the tv. I felt so much saddness for those who lost loved ones, and I felt soooo much animosity for those who created and supported these acts. \"\"I believe that Bin Laden, with the support of the Taliban are responsible.\"I think that these people has misinterperated their religious beliefs to believe that they must destroy anyone outside their faith.0Because we deserve it. I call it political karma for our crappy foreign policy that most of us were totally unaware of.I believe it is probably Osama Bin LadenI am more paranoid.\"I am still doing the things I have always done.  Therefore, I think my feelings and beliefs have changed more than my behaviors.  For instance, I appreciate my family more than ever.  \"\"I think they must angry with America.  We must have done something to them, whether it was morally correct on our part or not.\"\"The events of September 11, 2001 were completely shocking and horrifying to say the least.  In fact, it was so abstract from everyday life, I almost didn\'t believe my mother when she called to tell me about the event.  I remember it clearly because I was in my dorm room, studying before my 12:30 class.  When my mother told me, I didn\'t fully understand how serious and drastic the event actually was.  But when I told my roommate and she turned on the news, I was completely speechless as I saw the two airplanes fly into the World Trade Center buildings.  I think that actually seeing it happen made it real in my mind and I was suddenly very scared. I cried a few times.  When I saw a picture in the newspaper of a man who had jumped out of the building to escape being burned or crushed it just broke my heart.  But it really sunk in when the news played some of messages that the victims left for their loved ones.  The message I heard was from a woman calling to tell her husband that there was an explosion in the building and that she loved him very much.  I could hear the terror in her voice.  I believe those images will forever be imprinted in all of our minds when we think of the thousands of innocent people who died that day. Some of the stories are inspirational, however.  There are stories of people who escaped the falling buildings.  Also, the stories of heroes who sacrificed their own lives to save the victims of this tragic event.  I think it\'s the hope that comes from these stories that keeps us all going. It is very difficult for us all to understand why anyone would want to kill innocent people.  I do not see what can be solved by this act of hatred.  The people who have committed these malicious acts are obviously very angry and very confused individuals. I think we can only pray that the people who did this will come to the realization that what they have done is wrong. I am very upset that the event has led us to war.  Now, we are leading even more people to death.  I do not understand how violence can be the solution to ending violence.  It does not make since to me.  My prayers go out to all of the soldiers who must give up their lives to fight this war.  Even those soldiers who may not die in the war, my prayers go out to them because they will not be the same after participating in war.   Most of all, I think this event has changed me as an individual.  I try to stop and appreciate my family.  I always tell them that I love them everytime we part.  It has made me realize exactly how vulnerable we are, even as American citizens.  Finally, it has made me value every day that God has given me.  \"I don\'t think we have come up with enough information to answer that question completely. But I do think that Osama bin Laden may be responsible.\"Like so many people of the world, I am deeply saddened, to the core, by the incidents of last week and feel so strongly for the individuals who experienced personal loss. I am concerned about the negative effects of retaliatory action.  I have many questions about the history of the hatred that so many Arab nations have for the U.S.\"outwardly more expressive of protectionist feelings of those who might be persecuted based on religion or country of origina coalition of militant Arab groupsto hurt the U.S. economically and emotionally to bring into question the U.S. position in the Middle EastThey feel that they were wronged in some way.  Their conviction was strong enough that they were willing to die.bin Laden was the person behind it.  I do think that the United States should realize the political roll it played in thiss event however.  We are not blameless.\"I pay more attention to the TV (well, I watch the news a lot more).  I have spent as much time as possible wiht friends and family.  I try not to fight over petty things anymore.  I am more aware of the feelings and needs of others.\"\"I am still feeling a bit nervous about what happened.  I tend to find myself jumping up at loud noises that I would usually ignore.  At night it is hard to go to sleep because I still see some of the horrific images that were shown on tv in my head (such as people jumping from buildings, fire and explosions,etc).  I was having nightmares up to about two days ago.  In general, I still remain very tired from both lack of sleep and stress.  I am worried about what will happen in the future, whether or not there will be a war.  I cannot say that I am in favor of a war, because I think it will only lead to further death and destruction.  There are too many scary weapons out there that culd be used against the US, so I think it would be worth the time it takes to find another solution to the problem.  I still feel a bit of sadness.  So many people died for what seemed like no reason.  My heart goes out to them and thier families.  I remain grateful that I am still here and that I have my family.  Luckily, no one I immediately know was killed.  If anything, I am hoping that we as a society will learn from this disaster.  I am hoping that I too will remember how precious life is and that I should be grateful for what I have.  Things will never be the same.  It is uplifting to me to see my community pull together to help in the rescue efforts (such as sending money, donating blood, etc).  I have noticed that people are just a little nicer to strangers than they were before.  I find myself more concious of those around me.  It is good to know that the country is pulling together.  My roommates and I joined the rest of our neighborhood in putting candles on the porches.  It helped a little to know that others cared.\"\"Perhaps the Talaban...I wouldn\'t be surprised if the Islamic people were against the U.S. After all, we are supporting Israel and the Islamic people probably see it as 2 Christian nations trying to rise against them.\"The future doesn\'t seem to mean 10 years from now...the future seems more like 10 minutes from now. Who knows what\'ll happen the next minute?I think the end of the world is near. It\'s frightening but it\'s reality. America might try to tighten security even if it means taking away some of the Americans\' freedom but that\'s not going to abolish terrorism. Who knows what\'ll happen next. All I can think of doing is to go out and start evangelizing because all we can do now is pray and just trust in the sovereignty of God.

'\"My behavior has changed little, if any.\"\"Extreme rage and a feeling, however reasonable, of  injustice.  \"\"I think that the events of terrorism that have recently occurred in the United States are tragic and reprehensible.  However, I think that  to  fight fire with fire  would reduce the United States to the level  of the terrorists themselves.  Therefore I think that the U.S. should  respond in a calculated and intellectual, not strong armed, manner in order to avoid the loss of more innocent lives, such as the ones in which they seek retribution for,in  order to represent themselves as the stonger and ultimately more civilized and noble  society than those who executed this grave injustice upon them. Please let humanity and not  vengeance guide the U.S. government\'s will, and they will emerge the victor.   \"\"I would not like to speculate, due to my feeling of lack of definitive information.\"\"Watch the news a bit more, but other than that very little has changed.\"\"Because they thought that it was the right thing to do through some misguided beleif system, it is hard for others to understand, but cults often bring out extream behaviours in their members.\"\"I think it is a shocking event, but it still seems a little surreal -  like a movie I guess. I think it is concerning to think about what the  long term implications for world politics will be as a result of this. It is too difficult to process the full extent of the events, and  not knowing New York or any one involved means that watching and  following the news seems more like some gruesome voyaristic activity. \"\"I think it is probably too early to tell, but it is a complex combination of Islamic terrorists, USA foreign policy and Islamic/ Judeo Christian world politics\"because they believe so deeply in their cause.  Because the afterlife is more important to them than this life therefore their life and others are unimportantwary about air travel ( not that that is an option since our local air service Ansett went broke at the same time as the disaster)\"My immediate feeling was of deep shock and disbelief.  I then found that I could not stop watching the tv in an effort to maybe find out that the magnitude had somehow been exaggerated.  I guess also to some degree I also felt a bit distanced from the events.  In the days since my feelings have been more about anxiety for the world and worrying if Australia may also suffer some terrorist attacks with the upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government conference in Brisbane.  I still feel the greatest sense of loss for the American people, not only for those killed but for the loss of innocence and freedom\"a fundimentalist muslem group\"Terrorist groups connected to Bin Lauden, but not ruling out involvement of others too.\"\"hatred of American policies, to show power.\"\"want to sleep more, read more books to escape current day realities.\"\"I initially found myself watching HOURS of tv....shocked at what happened. Most difficult to believe was that the WTC actually collapsed. I thought about the last time I was there with friends visiting from Spain. Guess I felt they were indestructable. So first shock, then sadness..leading now to anxiety over the future. It is frightening to wonder where things may go from here, how it will effect our lifestyles, the possibility of WW 3.  At this point I try not to watch tv or get into many conversations about it. I find it easiest to keep up to date by reading news sites on the net where there is less emotion displayed. I dream about it. Last night I dreamt about bombing in Afghan. and saw buildings (skyscrapers as in NY) crumble and bounce down the streets. Apparantly I can force my daytime mind not to focus on this but at night it comes back into my thoughts when I am unable to push them away.\"Sleep disturbances...desires to be isolated.\"I think they are raised with misconceptions about America, and are only doing what they were raised to believe.\"Osama Binladen\'s followers\"I was horrified by the attack.  My innocence was stolen, leaving me unsure of things I had believed since birth.  America is supposed to be a strong, safe country. These things aren\'t supposed to happen here.  I did not know anyone who was involved; however, I found myself unable to turn off the news for days following the incident.  In the past I have suffered from depression, and I noticed feeling recurring feelings while watching the news updates.  Then all of a sudden I\'d feel awful for feeling depressed because I know I lead a good a life and I should be very thankful for all I have.  I feel like I shouldn\'t be so upset by the attack since  I was fortunate enough to not know anyone, yet I still find myself uneasy and unable to sleep because all this has brought back my past depression symptoms: lack of normal sleeping habits, feelings of lonliness...  Now, a week later, I\'m starting to ease back into normalcy, but as soon as I see more news updates, my heart sinks. \"\"To get back at America for killing their people, taking their oil, or invading their land. Or all three.\"Innocent until proven guitly. I hope who ever did this died on one of the hijacked planes. \"I suppose there are a lot of feeling flying around. But first I felt sad. Sad that after all this time someone final got to us. I felt like we almost deserved it for all the awful things the US has done to other countries,either directly or indirectly. Then I started focusing on HOW they did it. They used our own technology against us and well as our own innocent people. I can\'t imagine what goes through your head as your plane is being hijacked. Not an international flight, no one asking for money... just move the the back of the plane.  I find it amazing that the flights weren\'t more crowded. But thankful. When it comes to Mr. Bush and his followers I get scared. Scared that he doesn\'t know the names of the people he needs to gain support from and scared that he is going to implement some ridiculus missle defense plan that in the past situation would have done us no good. Worst yet, he is going to bomb innocent people and send our men and women into a no-win war. I don\'t know what the answer is and I don\'t pretend to but as far as I am concerned as soon as a innocent person dies from our rage, revenge, and retaliation we are just as bad as they are. Mostly I am confused. If killing the bad guy isn\'t the way to go which way do we go? I\'m disappointed that it\'s come to this and at the same time I think it\'s a good lesson for most americans to learn. They don\'t travel, other than to say \'I\'ve been to Paris, London, etc.\' Name dropping. Do they know that other countries deal with terrorism EVERYDAY. Have they ever seen with their own eyes a war village? Probably not but I still can\'t excuse the hatred of other cultures, nationalities, or countries. It was a horrible crime and I am sad so many people are lost, dead, and hurting. But why when it happens other places no one in america stops at 7:30PST to light a candle or pray? Why is it only when it\'s AMERCIANS have died? Why can\'t it be jsut anyone? I hate that about us. Look at the world and how they responded to this event. You have (or at least I have) never seen americans weep for someone else horrible event. It\'s confusing and sad. \"By behaviors have not changed\"I think that it was one of the most horrible criminal attacks ever perpetrated.  I do want to see terrorism totally shut down, however I am horrified at Americans attacking Americans!\"IgnoranceBin Ladindrinking and cooking only with bottled wated.  Envy glorified by religious fervor\"My perspective is pretty direct.  My office at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center is about 9 miles north of Ground Zero; my office is on the 18th floor, and my window looks south.  Around 9:00 on 9/11, one of our young analysts came into my office looking more spacey than usual, and he said,  Open your blinds.  I\'ve just seen something I don\'t believe.   I didn\'t take him too seriously, and I can\'t reach my blinds, but he is tall.  He opened them, and we saw the smoke pouring from the top of the towers.  When we realized that both towers had been affected, we knew it could not be an accident.  I said,  Our lives have been permanently changed.   Then I sat down and tried unsuccessfully to get 1010 WINS on my computer.  Shortly thereafter two other coworkers who have radios came in, and we listened to the news. I said,  There goes our freedom.  Up in smoke.   Shortly thereafter, one of the towers disappeared from view.  And then there were none.  I knew that my husband had clients in the towers, and I thought my son did as well, but both my husband and my sons turned out to be safe.  That evening, my husband brought home a client who lives in New Jersey and could not get home.  We had dinner, and he stayed overnight.  His office had been on the 85th floor of Tower 1.  He had just entered the elevator from the lobby when the first plane hit.  He was thinking about a business problem and just registered the boom and whoosh as  One of the elevators must have fallen.  How terrible!   But then he went back to thinking about his problem and exited from the elevator in leisurely fashion.  But when he reentered the lobby, he encountered the fireball and felt its heat, so he left the building.  On their cell phones, he called his partner, who was in the process of shepherding about 25 employees down the stairs from the 85th floor.  It took over an hour, and they had been out of the building for about 10 minutes before it collapsed.  This information made me think that the loss of life would be in less than 5 digits, which had been my original estimate given the number of people who worked in the towers.  From that perspective, a hit 2 hours later in the day might have been worse.  One of my colleagues was married to a firefighter who died.  The funeral will be this Friday, and she has 2 young children.  I can\'t imagine what they are going through, although at least they are not alone.  For the first week after the event, it felt as if everyone I saw was sitting shiva (the Jewish custom for the first week of mourning for an immediate family member).  I was tired and irritable, the way I was after my mother died.  Now we are slowly beginning to get back to normal, but it is not a normal normal because our lives are in limbo as we wait for the next event -- next strike, declaration of war, or whatever.  I believe that the next few years will be difficult.  I do not believe that, as people on both the right and left assert, Americans do not have the will for a long fight, based on their distaste for the Vietnam war.  It is incomprehensible to me that people cannot see the difference between the current situation and Vietnam; obviously this struggle, whatever it involves, is not optional.  It is an attack on the things we hold dearest, our values as well as our lives.  We cannot opt out, and I think we will ultimately prevail, but the costs may be very high.  The outpouring of love, courtesy, and kindness is a comfort, but I always knew it was there in a pinch, and I wish we didn\'t need it.    \"Bin Laden and other clever opportunists and some suckers.\"Not much, but I don\'t like to look out my window any more.\"Religious fundamentalism.   \"I hate the talk of war and seeking revenge.  Should we bomb Afghanistan we also will be killing innocent people, just as the terrorists did to us.   The best suggestion I have heard for this situation is to kidnap all the Afghan women and educate them.  \"Not much changed.I have no opinion.  I only know what I read or hear from the news.  Because they do not believe in the equality of the human spirit.\"Hmmmm... Well.... Let\'s see.  My perspective... I know myself well enough to know that I must write a bit to truly get out what I really mean to say, so bear with me while I figure this out.  I know that I will remember exactly what I was doing all day on 9/11.  I expect my kids to ask me what it was like as, up to now, it has been the most tragic world event I have lived through.  I had hoped that nothing of this magnitude would occur in my lifetime, but alas, many died that day and now we have a  new war.   I know that the 9/11 event caused a surge of patriotism in many people.   However, not that I am less proud of my country, but I really didn\'t want to fight back.  I wanted the government to take actions to protect we citizens from future attacks, but I never really hated.  I am confused by the hatred that would cause someone to do such a thing, but I am not blind to the fact that the same evil causes us Americans to want to hurt those who hurt us.  That is not the answer and although I know the US will continue to  rid the world of terrorism,  I know that it is impossible to rid the world of hate.  Perhaps ths is getting a little too philosophical, but I think the answer to the question,  what is my perspective on the events...?   is that it was terrible, it was evil and it is my hope that the US will not retort in a similar anger and hatred, but with a love for peace and protection, not more destruction.  The only thing that I really hate... is war.  I know that at times it is inevitable.   We must protect ourselves... but unnecessary violence only promotes it rather than counteracting it.  I did cry for those families and friends who lost people in the attack.  But the hate that fueled the actions of the pilots is the same hatred that causes us to ostracize members of our own community and not reach out to those who need our help.  It is a question of good and evil, of hatred and peace.  September 11 was just the most horrible display of it that I have seen affect the most people.  I hope I even remotely gave you an answer that you could use.  \"Those who gave into the temptation to hate others.I pray more.',3,-5,0,2,5,0.39,8.6,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,0.78,0,0,0,9.37,0,0.78,0,0,0,1.56,0.78,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,2.73,1.17,0,1.17,1.95,0.78,0,0,10.94,0,0,0,0.39,0,0.78,0.78,0,50,0,2.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.2,0.78,0,4.3,0,0,0,0.78,0,0.78,0,1.56,0,0,0,21.09,8.2,3.91,0.39,0,0,10.55,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,1.95,0,0,0.39,Female

I kept imagining how the poor people in  the planes must have felt when they realised what would happen. And  shortly afterwards I became very frightened of a possible military act ion by the US. Because I suspect that this could be exactly what the  terrorists were aiming at, to force the moderate Arab nations to take  sides against the US. I really hate the \'clash of cultures\' discussion.  Because its wrong. Among the most hated enemies of the islamic radicals  are nations like Saudi-Arabia. I began to think how I would feel if  other symbols of nations I like would be destroyed like the Eiffel  tower or Big Ben. I was relieved that as far as I knew none of my  acquaintances was hurt in the attack. And I began to think bad of  myself because this attack threw me, while happenings in Ruanda left  not much more than a name in my memory. Can it be that the suffering  of people who I think are similar to me seems worse to me? I tried to  think how to help. And I noticed that in the internet community that  I participated in the hate against the moslems began to rise. So I  devoted my time to explain the big diference between moslems and  radikal islamists. And still I wonder what the terrorists really want  to achieve. Because that is what we have to know i order to prevent  further terrorism, isnt it? All the following days I noticed that to  feel happy or to laugh no matter what the cause somehow seemed wrong.  And I berated myself for a kind of morbid fascination with the pictures. I felt helpless and angry, the more so the more the talk about war was aired. I just wish there was something I could do that really would make a difference and I keep thinking on how to use my cpabilities and knowledge to prvent further occurences. \"To impress on the world that the last superpower US is  not all-powerful.

Fortunately, everyone ended up okay, even my friend who used to work on the 82nd floor of the second  tower.  So then I felt grateful.  Now though I am upset.  At the people who did this, yes, but also at how people here in the US are acting-- not those who are helping but those in the minority who are making muslims and others (anyone who looks like they could be Islamic, etc)  their scapegoats.  This is not what America is supposed to be about. And now I also fear that this will just be endless round of retaliations back and forth.  Do we need to respond?  Yes and I\'m not sure how.  But we don\'t need to hurt innocent people in Afghanistan in order to do so. \"\"Well, clearly someone who would do this, particularly those who kill themselves in the process of doing so  must believe (be brainwashed) very strongly in their cause.

Yet I also fear our response. I wish I had more confidence in our leaders to handle this in the best way, and I am not sure  bombing them (whoever they are) back to stone  is the right response. I know we have perpetuated violence at times, too, so that worry that our response might be hypocritical. I find myself grateful for the responses of unity among Americans, and at the same time appalled at the hatred I see in so many, the reprisals against anyone who looks Middle Eastern. I knew no one  in NYC or in the WTC, and yet i notice that I am often close to tears, and often feel the flutter of panic in my chest and stomach.

'\"  The destruction of the twin towers and the pentagon on sept 11. was very frightening and eye opening to me.  So often these same occurances (ie missles, bombs, etc.) take place on foreign soil. . . NEVER on our soil.  When I first heard the news it sounded like a movie. . . it wasn\'t real. . .it seemed like  Independence Day.   To me, the US is/was untouchabe, but now i realize it\'s not.  I do not fear for my safety, but whenever i hear a plane am reminded that my safety is not guarenteed.     I believe that these events will help our country unite, and i\'ve heard many people say that they are glad that we are going to war b/c we will all unite.  However, I don\'t understand why we have to JUST NOW pull together as ONE COUNTRY. . .i\'m confused as to why something this dramatic and earth shattering has to happen on OUR soil before we come together. . . why couldn\'t we have united in the same way when the embassy bombings happend in past years (was is b/c it wasn\'t on our soil?)    I am shocked by the events and feel very distant from them.  After seeing so many news clips on it I feel as though it never really happened, is just a movie, and is in some far off place.  I feel like i have been numbed by the media b/c i have been constantly bombarded with news and photos of the damage for the past 2 weeks.  I also don\'t feel like I can do anything to help.    That\'s all i can say for now.    \"a group of terrist funded by bin laden\"because they want to be the ultimate power, feel religiously obligated, are jealous of the US and wealthy countries\"\"i\'ve talked to my parents more, i\'ve watched the news more, i\'ve been to more prayer services, i\'ve been more patriotic\"\"The events were shocking, even though I had believed that it was only a matter of time before the US would be struck by some sort of terrorist activity.  Seeing the buildings fall was the most terrible of all - and seeing people jumping from buildings, falling, standing in windows while smoke and fire was all around them - knowing that these people were no longer alive, and had died in fear and pain.  My brother lives in Brooklyn Heights and works about 1 mile from the WTC - and he takes the train that passes through that area often - I was worried about his safety, and was relieved that he was okay.  My college roommate\'s husband works in the financial district, perhaps in one of the buildings that was hit or fell - I called, after having not spoken with her in years, and said I hoped they were all safe, and okay -I haven\'t heard back from her, and am still worried that he was hurt, or that they lost friends.  I plan to call her again.   After the initial shock, I thought about how the terrorists displayed many of the qualities that are so admired in our country, that are exemplary of success and progress - they were obviously intelligent, inventive, conservative of their resources (used our planes, e.g.) dedicated to their (evil) cause, able to plan carefully, and to wait until the right time (put off immediate gratification), connect with others who could support them, further their plans, and finally to give their lives for a cause they believed was ordained by God. It made me realize how important it is for us to see the complexity of evil, of those who perpetrate it, in order truly to stop it.  I was probably most disheartened by the simplistic, jingoistic sentiment expressed by the administration (and others) because I felt so strongly that this clever, careful, deliberate act of terrorism had something important to teach us - we needed to avoid the  feel-good  response of kicking their (whose?) butts, because it wouldn\'t stop the terror - it would only do what the ensuing days have proven - inflamed facile, xenophobic violence against persons who  look like bad guys - arab, muslim, etc .   Overall, I have felt terribly sad, grieved for the persons searching for loved ones, for persons burying the dead, for all who have seen, smelled, tasted death and suffering trying to help.  I want the guilty stopped, but not at the expense of the impoverished, oppressed people in Afghanistan (e.g.).  I want America to rise up against bigotry, not only because it\'s evil itself, but because the energy spent on bigotry needs to be redirected to coping with a basic, and ultimately comforting truth:  Evil is subtle, and comes in all forms, colors, etc.  Life is ephemeral, and can be gone in an instant.  The richness of life is measured by the number of moments we are truly grateful for our dear ones, beauty, sustenance.  Focus on gratitude, justice, service - make life sweet.     \"\"Rage; feelings of impotence; desire for prestige, admiration from their peers/communities; desire for control \"\"Islamic Extremists, the equivalent of White Power Christian Groups in the US - probably Osama bin Laden, probably despotic Arab govts such as Afghanistan, Iraq, supported and encouraged these guys.\"\"I spend more time playing and laughing with my daughter.  I called the local Islamic center to offer my support and assistance with anything that might help them cope with the threats they have received (I am not a muslim).  I am thinking a lot about how the US can use the opportunity of punishing the terrorists to encourage oppressive governments to feed, free their people - how can we win the peace?  That\'s the tough part.  \"\"I have overwhelming feelings of immense sadness at the loss of people\'s lives who were only going about their daily business of living.  I understand that is why this is  terrorism,  but I have such heartache for families who will again never have all their members gathered together due to such a cowardly act as this.  No one who died was able to choose whether or not to participate.  Their participation was merely circumstance.  They didn\'t even have a chance to see their killer(s) face.  I feel no anger.  Just an overwhelming sense of loss and fear that it could be me and my family if the location were different.\"\"An excellent question!  Hate, fear and a need to  control  are my thoughts.\"I have no basis for an assumption other than what the U.S. government has determined.\"I am, by nature, a very optimistic, upbeat person.  I am somewhat less now and find myself moved to tears quickly when personal stories of loss are shared.\"\"I think Osama Bin Ladin is responsible, but I imagine that he also had support from other groups and/or countries\"\"I woke up on the morning of September 11th and I was stressed because I needed to work on a paper and was not really sure how to start.  I turned on the Today Show as I was making my coffee, and wasn\'t really paying much attention.  I started hearing wierd things, though, and went into my living room to listen more closely.  By this time, both towers had been hit, and they were in the process of collapsing.  I remember seeing the pictures and thinking that it could not really be possible, it looked like something that would happen in a foreign country but not here, not in New York.  I had spent a lot of time in New York City, and had been in the World Trade Center several times.  It was hard to believe that it was the same place that I was now seeing on the news.  I sat on the couch and watched the news for the rest of the day.  I wanted to talk to people, I called my parents even though they don\'t live anywhere near New York or Washington but I just wanted to hear their voices, make sure they were okay.  I remember thinking that waking up worrying about a paper I needed to write was pretty trivial, when all of these horrible things were happening at the same time.\"\"I never thought twice about getting on a plane for a domestic flight, but now I think I\'d be more hesitant.  In a way, it sort of made me re-prioritize things - I guess I realized that a lot of things that I worry about really, in the long run, are not that important.\"\"It is hard to understand...they believe they are doing it for god and it is their duty, but it is very difficult for me to understand why someone would take so many lives, as well as their own\"\"Islamic terrorists, headed by Osama Bin Laden.  I also think Saddam Hussein had a hand in it somehow and is most likely behind the Anthrax letters.\"\"I refuse to give in to them.  I\'m just being more careful of mail, especially at work.  If I sit next to an Arabic-looking person on a plane I might be a little nervous and I will try to strike up a conversation to feel him out.  That is not something I would have done before.  I usually like to read and rest while I fly.\"Religious fanaticism.  Hate.  Envy.  We\'re viewed as the   Evil Empire  by the uneducated masses of the Arab world. \"I was born in NYC and raised in the suburbs and have always felt a connection to The City  even though I now live over an hour away on eastern Long Island.  It seems as if everyone here in the N.Y. Metropolitan area either knows someone who died, or knows someone who knows someone who died, or knows someone who was supposed to be in the WTC when it happened but for one reason or another wasn\'t there that day.  Whew!  Around here, it feels like a very personal tragedy.  They attacked OUR city and OUR towers, it\'s like they violated our personal space.  I was at work when it happened and heard it on the radio. At first I thought a small plane just veered off course for some reason.  My 18 yr old daughter was home from school sick that day so I called her and told her to put CNN on because a plane had just flown into the WTC.  She saw the 2nd one hit and I still haven\'t figured out if she saw it live or what.  It was obvious to me what had happened then - my first thought was Muslim terrorists.  I was shocked, but not surprised - I don\'t know if that makes sense or not.  The bank where I work became very quiet, if anyone was talking it was in whispers.  I don\'t remember feeling so frightened since The Cuban Missle Crisis, when we all thought the Russians were going to drop  the bomb  on us.  When they hit the Pentagon I knew we were going to war as that now constituted an attack on our government.  When the 4th plane went down in Pennsylvania I just wondered how many more there were and where they were going to hit next.  I thought of  Red Storm Rising , a book I had read years ago and it gave me the chills.  My knee jerk reaction was that we should just go out and  get  whoever did this.  I felt such anger and animosity towards all Arabic people even while at the same time I knew that wasn\'t reasonable.  I had to literally remind myself this was done by religious fanatics who hate everything we stand for, not all Arabs.  Of course, it didn\'t help to see shots of Palestinians celebrating in the streets later that day.  I feel so sad for the families of the victims.  I lost my husband to cancer 2 years ago and am very sensitive to any kind of death, especially premature death.  When I saw the people with placards which had pictures of their missing loved ones I felt physical pain in my chest and throat and I couldn\'t stop crying.  Every time I see pictures of the Towers my eyes well up.  My late husband didn\'t like elevators and it took me years to talk him into going up to Windows on the World to eat.  His last Christmastime he relented and took us there for dinner a few days before Christmas.  It was one of the most spectacular views I\'ve ever seen - it was a clear night and the city was ablaze with Christmas lights.  I will never forget it and now it\'s gone because of a group of madmen.  It seems incomprehensable.  I fear nothing will ever be the same for us in this country. I don\'t think I have ever felt this kind of anger before.  I remember, when Bin Laden was identified as the probable culprit, thinking of Pearl Harbor and a famous quote from a Japanese Admiral about  awakening a sleeping giant .  I was overwhelmed with a feeling of superiority over those  uncivilized madmen .  I say to Mr. Bin Laden:  Beware the sleeping giant, because you have not only awakened it you have enraged it and we are coming after you and everything you stand for.  Don\'t think we will be soft as we were in Vietnam, we weren\'t attacked then.  Those of us who were against that war are definatlely FOR this one.  We WILL defeat you, we are still the mightiest nation in the world today and the rest of the civilized world seems to be siding with us - they know they could by next. The range of feelings I have is quite wide.  From sadness and anger to pride, determination and even laughter - I\'m proud of our government for it\'s reasonable response, especially since I didn\'t vote for the current administration.  I\'m thrilled that Mr. Bush is doing  ok  in this horrid situation.  It\'s nice to see the gov\'t. working together instead of playing  partisan politics games .  I\'m proud of our NYC firefighters and police officers for their courage and sacrifice, as well as all the rescue workers at all the attack sites.  I\'m proud of the passengers on the Pennsylvania plane for thwarting the plans of the terrorists on that plane. They showed us we CAN do something in a plane to help defend ourselves.  And we shouldn\'t give in them.  We need to keep living our lives.  My daughter and I flew 2 weeks after the attack and my brother and mother flew last week.  I\'ll be flying again in 2 weeks.  My older daughter, who is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, will fly home for Christmas and  our family will go into NYC at Christmastime, as is our tradition.  We will see a Broadway show, see the tree at Rockerfeller Center, go to Macy\'s and FAO Schwartz, and all the other things we love to do.  If we don\'t live in fear, in spite of the newest attack - Anthrax, we can and will defeat them.  Last but not least, as the something good that always rises out of the ashes, our love of our country has bloomed.  It seems as if we stand together in this as we haven\'t been since WWII.  I always thought the rest of the country didn\'t  like  New Yorkers, but the ourpouring of love and support for New York has been beautiful.  We are all flying flags again and seem proud to be Americans.  I hope the  united  feeling we all have now will remain indefinately. Finally, for a little bit of humour. I received an e-mail from my gay brother in California who had this to say:  Forget about killing Bin Laden, that will only make him a martyr.  If we imprison him his cohorts will only take hostages to try and gain his release.  A better idea is to capture him (and all his cohorts), put them through a sex change operation and send them back to Afghanistan to live under the Taliban as women!  Now THAT is justice.   Thanks for letting me bare my soul - I feel better already. I hope I have helped.  I have a special affinity for UT as my Peace Corps daughter has her MA in Latin American Geography from UT!      \"because he is a coward and evil and is jealous of america and our ability to overcome.I am more sensitive to other peoples feelings and more closer to my family.Osama Bin Laden\"I feel that the events of 09-11-01 were very tragic I truly feel for the victims and their families , but also I feel that if we had not gotten so lazy in our being  american  we could have avoided some of this.\"NoneA mix of America pursuing its own political ends and Islamic fanaticism\"I feel that such an attack was cruel and inhumane, and undeserving to the people of America. But, people are dying in the masses daily in third world Africa - how many people are crying for their losses? More so, in other world crisis such as Kosovo, how many inncocent civilians were kiled by American soldiers? It seems that America, acting under the guise of policing the world, are in many circumstances pursuing their own political endeavours, as can be noted in the support of countries such as Turkey, allowing them to conquer Cyprus and Constantinople, and in aiding Albanians conquer a foreign land. America has acted in many circumstances more out of political interest, than in the interest of what is right and just. Thus, although I do no condone the September 11th attack, I feel that there is much to rectify in the American political arena.\"\"Disappointment with American politics actions, and, in the name of religious fanaticism\"I think that I value my time and family more now that ever.

At 25, I had to take a crash course in US/Mid East politics to understand it all.  Unfortunately, I didn\'t even know where Afganistan was in relation to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan.  It is probable that our children do not know either.  How do we explain this to them? My father worked in the WTC North Tower for a decade.  He was laid off during company downsizing last June.  I feel guilty that he was spared and others died.  He lost co-workers and friends.  I cannot imagine how he must be feeling.  My Dad says that we just need to get back to normal.  But what is normal now?  My father and my family were touched by the finger of GOD, so to speak and I should just go back to  normal?   I used to listen to my grandmother talk about Pearl Harbor and how horrific the scenes in the newspaper were.  She called me the day after the attack and said,  Remember all the imagees I recounted from Pearl Harbor?  They don\'t even come close to what we saw yesterday.    This is possibly the gravest attack on the US in history.\"A consortium of religious groups who have been harboring hateful feelings of America for a long time.\"    I think that the tragic event that happend on September affected the nations.  I feel that wven though ou country,  the Us,  the only world I know and love has changed.  the economy has taken a dramatic fall, nd it seems as though people are scared to invest or spend money the way they did before.  Many small company\'s, such as remodeling and realestate have lost a business due to september 11th.  What happend has made our country grow, sacrifice, learn, and look at things differently as a whole.  It has also had many negetive affcts. i am in a way glad that it has happend because it has brought our country to holding hand with one another instead of competition and money money money,  but it has devistated my heart with every thing and every person we have lost.\"\"anger, and jealous\"anger\"i have grown a littl e more anger,  bu to the us has things under control\"\"I was shocked initially.  Then after about 5 days, I was depressed ,very sad, and guilty.  Now, it is anger.  I want something done now. However, I realize that I have to be patient, and that everything will happen in due time.  It makes me angry that we would strike out against those who are of similar ethnic backgrounds--to those of the terrorists--here in the US.  I hope that people will eventually see that everyone is different and that they need to focus only on those  who were active in or those who have helped or are helping them.

'Islam terrorists\"Because i don\'t listen to radio or TV during the day, I found out about the attacks from my neighbor. My first reaction was great fear. I asked,  What do we do now?  as I put my arms up to cover my head. And I answered myself,  I know. We bend over and kiss our ass goodbye.  I felt a throw back to the fears of the cold war, when we knew that an Russian atomic or hydrogen bomb would kill us; no place to run, no place to hide.  Then the fear numbed me. I began watching the events on TV and was horrified and couldn\'t really accept that what had happened was real. Like many people, it felt as if I were watching a movie. Later in the day, seeking some semblance of normalcy, I went to my weaving class. But after about a half-hour, I had to stop; I couldn\'t concentrate or focus on what I was doing. When I left I intended to go home and meditate. But I drove around and found myself at a Wal-Mart store, where I seldom shop. In a complete mental haze (yet functioning and comprehending) I went into the optometrist and had an eye exam and ordered a pair of glasses. I did need both the exam and the new glasses. When I returned home I realized that I was grieving and allowed that feeling to express itself in occassional crying and great feelings of sadness. For the next few days I wore a black armband. I watched less and less TV about the attacks. Gradually over a few days, my sadness abated. No one I know was hurt in the attacks, and living in CA I feel far removed from the event. I was concerned with the nationalism exhibited by all the flag flying, but I did put small US and UN flags in the rear window of my car. Now that the  war  has started, I\'m just waiting, without anxiety, to see what happens next. I practice Buddhism which helps me retain calm yet alert.\"I listen to less news and avoid all talking heads giving their opinions and best guesses of what\'s happening and will happen and why.Their irrational fears and crazy thinking leads them to hate some entity enough to destroy it even as they destroy themselves.\"Because of poor communications and underhanded deals from country to country, that is out of the control of American citizens.\"\"Initially I was shocked, outraged and down right angry.  Being a student at Park University I was in class when the news brought the information about the first plane and we continued to watch while both towers collapsed.  While listening to the information about the Pentagon.  All of a sudden there was a division on campus that is hard to describe.  All of the foreign students were identifyable all of a sudden in a way that never mattered.  People seemed to be careful what they said to each other and the feelings grew as we exhaled from the initial shock.  All international students became targets for much of the bad feelings brought on by Sept 11th if whether they were born within the United States or not.  Being Afro American I have felt some of these feelings, but it was clear that this feeling was new for some of these students.  Some discontinued thier studies and others are riding the wave hoping hthings will settle down soon.  But all of the students were devastated national and international students and grieved together for the senseless lost of lives on Sept 11th.\"The United States.My behavior has changed as far as my understanding of some of our international students and our custom procedures.Because they are convinced it is right in the name of a God and a religion.

I could not believe it. I had a lot of work to do on that day but it was very difficult to concentrate. It felt like it was disrespectful to the victims to do my usual everyday work, like nothing had happened. Since then, I can\'t avoid listening carefully to airplanes when they fly over Montreal where I live. Last night (September 28), I had a nightmare about terrorist attacks. The first one since Sept. 11 (the first one I remember at least). There were special airplanes, almost invisible. The terrorists were aliens (extra-terrestrians). We could not communicate with them. In my dream, there was also a terrorist attack with a boat crashing in a other one. Then there was a flood (I often dream of floods when I am under stress).\"I do not feel as safe as before. I worry more about future.\"On an actionable, material level - the terrorists who perpetrated the attacks.  Probably linked to Osama bin Laden. On an energetic, human interaction, and consciousness level - we all are.  We have created the dynamic of duality.  We are responsible for transcending it.\"\"The tragic events of September 11th, 2001 signal to me a bifurcation point in our collective conscious evolution.  A marked point when the steady periodic rhythm of life is interrupted.  At this juncture, we will get a rare glimpse into the \'consciousness-psyche\' of an immense culture.  We, especially our brothers and sisters in the US, have been outrageously jolted into an awareness of our vulnerable position in relation to forces we don\'t fully understand.   It is this lack of understanding that allows us to maintain our illusion of separateness.  Like it or not (how obvious must it get?, we are living cheek to jowl, energetically engaged in a dance of cultural creation with the rest of the world.  The quality of the reality which we will dance into being, through our dynamic movements together, is the juciest point of enquiry.  Will we find a way which is both just and compassionate?  Will we find a new way to be together at all?  Will we gravitate back into complacency?  The REAL question here is - how much more do we need to suffer before we get the message? I am heartened by the diversity I have played in, on the Internet.  I can feel myself intellectually and spiritually open when I allow being \'taken in\' by the storied perspectives of multiple points of contact.   As I explore these, my own perspective becomes clearer, calmer, and with (paradoxically) both sharper and lessened defense mechanisms at the ready.  At some level, I believe we all play a co-creative role in choosing which \'strange attractor\' we graviate to.  For me, the following beliefs are helpful:  Firstly, the principles and one law of open space must be considered -  - whoever comes are the right people,  - whenever it starts is the right time,  - whatever happens is the only thing that could have, and  - when it\'s over - it\'s over. - The Law of Mobility - if you are neither learning nor contributing to a conversation, move to somewhere else. Secondly, the principle of story circles.   - share, whenever possible, in an unobstructed circle and in a manner which honours that each person\'s perspective (story) is encoded with a truth or wisdom from them, just for you.  Listen for it.   - also, tell your own stories (thoughts, feelings, and beliefs) with that in mind. What is your wisdom gift?  Focusing on people\'s stories teaches us that we, and our stories, are not mutually exclusive propositions.  A story is a perspective - there are many.  When we come from a place where there is only one \'right\' story, we are overly defended and unable to take in essential evolutionary information from our environment.  We live in a world of complex relationships and multiple reality.   - seeing things from a storied perspective is to evolutionary psychology what virtual reality is to the future of cyberspace.  Leap to a new consciousness!  With this comes the responsibility and the blessing of choice.  Using it wisely figures prominently in whether we will continue to retain the privelege. In these ways, 9.11 has pushed me to engage in co-creating my own consciousness.  I, and we, are invited to self-organize with conscious intent. When asked how a person might truly save the world, Grandmother Tywla (a Native American wisewoman) replied, \'Save yourself.\'  I am aware that what I choose to mainfiest impacts the entire field.  Knowing this, I feel even more strongly called to add my voice, my gift, my foibles and humanity. Good question.  Thanks for the opportunity to tell a story - from my perspective.

Trying to be sensitive of other\'s religious convictions and faith, I have not shared what I believe to be  truth  and have more or less generalized my references to God and His Son, Jesus Christ, relying on the third person of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit to cover bases for me.  I will continue to be respectful of other perspectives, however, I will not temper my own view of salvation. \"I have to say that my political views have become a lot more conservative. I am frightened for our nation\'s security and I worry about my family and the impact that this is having on them.\"I was literally sick to my stomach on the morning of Sept. 11. I am schocked every time I see the footage and hear the stories at how much evil there is in the world, so much that all of those innocent lives were taken. I go to an ultra-liberal school (UC Berkeley) and all around me there is anti-war propaganda and people telling me that it was our own governmant\'s fault that these things happened. I have always though of myself as more liberal than conservative, but despite my fellow students anti-war and anti-Bush sentiments, I can\'t help but side with the President in the desire for justice.\"bin Lauden\"I have no idea how anyone could kill so many innocent people, and I don\'t knowing why they did it exactly would make it any easier to understand.\"I have no ideaBin Laddennone\"I don\'t really understand why they don\'t like us so much.  I am very upset that we might go to war, I don\'t want to loose any more Americans then we alredy have, but I guess that I am the only one that thinks this way.  What do they have against freedom?  I think that our Nation is a wonderful place, and it is not like we are forcing them to live here.  Maby the reason that we have more power then they do is because we have more people working on our problems, and working for America.  They only let half of their population do any of the thinking and there fore they are missing out on a lot of opoions.  But if that is how they want to live then fine, let them live that way.  But why do they have to come and bother us.  I know that we did some things to the middle east, but I just don\'t like that thought of a way, especially not one that is fought on our soil.  \"I\'m being as kind to others as I can because the world has become a bruised place.\"In my area in the year preceding these attacks, a carjacking led to the dragging death of a six-year-old, a respected and well-to-do pharmacist diluted chemotherapy drugs, a man was accused and will soon stand trial for kidnapping and murdering women who trusted him for profit and for arranging the illegal adoption of a child by his own brother, and a child\'s decapitated body was found in a park. To the inability to view others as human, add economic misery and a powerful person willing to provide someone with a comfortable cloak of respectability for his emptiness and rage--and you\'ve got a terrorist instead of our local monsters.\"\"At this point, it appears that a network of terrorists supported by Osam Bin Laden and approved/condoned by others who hold similar political and social views.\"\"When I first saw a co-worker\'s e-mail saying only that plane(s) had hit the WTC and asking  Terrorists?,  my mental picture was of a small plane and I thought it was an accident. Tragic, limited, an accident. When I left my office and found others gathered around the televisions and saw the burning towers and saw the replay of the second jet hitting the WTC, I kept thinking,  How did this happen?  My thought was that terrorists are who they are and do what they do, but that we should have had better defenses--airport security, intelligence, something. I still realized that I was seeing a tragedy of major proportions, but I was still thinking, with the memory of the previous bombing, that many people would be killed or hurt--but many would also survive (most on the lower floors, in fact). The collapse of the towers was the moment that I truly felt overwhelmed, I think. The physical reaction was immediate and, even though I knew exactly what it was, surprising. I wanted to sleep, right then, in that heavy tiredness that follows an adrenaline surge, but when I tried, I could feel every drop of blood racing all through my body. I called my sister who lives nearby where they have poor television service and told her to get a radio on and to be careful. She said that she had trouble hearing me and she was a little irritable with me at the time. Later that night, she skipped a graduate class to come by and watch the news with me. I didn\'t panic and I didn\'t  borrow trouble  by assuming anyone I knew was in either location, although it was always a possibility. I think the state of alert and dread and horror was very much like the week my father was hurt in a work accident, the week after his death six months later (always possible, but unexpected at that point), the week my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and the week preceding her death. The physical reaction lasted until the following Monday--that  thief on the run  tiredness, restless sleep at night, a sense of being isolated from any emotion unrelated to the situation, sudden waves of weakness. Students I saw, who were experiencing this reaction for the first time, including one who saw the second plane hit on live television, were most surprised and frightened by the physical symptoms because it was the first time. I knew and I was surprised and frightened. I kept saying,  There\'s been so much. I should be used to this by now,  thinking that exposure to so many natural and man-made tragedies and crises (I was born in 1953)should have somehow innoculated me against this. After awhile, I realized, how could anything? And yes, maybe it is appropriate that I would feel the same as I have for very personal disasters. I have been surprised at my ability to deal with the responses of others from a calmer place than usual--I don\'t like every response, I don\'t agree with every proposal or every choice of expression of feeling, but I do have some optimism (Me, optimism? That\'s different.) about how we will deal with this collectively while knowing with some certainty that we will also make mistakes that come back to haunt us. That\'s being human in a world of humans. At the same time, I know how deep and how permanent these wounds are. For two or more generations, the lives and dreams and careers lost in this event will also haunt our country and the world. \"Because they hate this country.  They actually are jealous and envious\"A combination of our politics and position and a group of angry, resentful, unhappy, misguided people.\"\"I am very jumpy.  I am more suspicious of others, though I try not to be.  I work in an environment that is over 50\% \'internationals.\'  The politically correct term for what we used to call foreigners.  I\'m thinking about stocking up on water and buying a gun.\"\"Are you truly interested???  I am deeply saddened and concerned for all of us.  I am frightened about what will happen in this country.  Our quality of life is so special and fragile, too.  I want to move to the country, dig a hole in the ground, and fill it with water.  Buy a gun, several attack dogs, and raise vegetables and chickens.  I would if I could.  I get so angry when I think about how vulnerable I feel and we as a nation are.  I am angry that I go along, doing what I\'m supposed to do, and other people, at their whim, can threaten all of that.  My life was already pretty stressful, and now I just want to sit in a heap and stare.          \"bin Laden was the person behind it.  I do think that the United States should realize the political roll it played in thiss event however.  We are not blameless.\"I pay more attention to the TV (well, I watch the news a lot more).  I have spent as much time as possible wiht friends and family.  I try not to fight over petty things anymore.  I am more aware of the feelings and needs of others.\"\"I am still feeling a bit nervous about what happened.  I tend to find myself jumping up at loud noises that I would usually ignore.  At night it is hard to go to sleep because I still see some of the horrific images that were shown on tv in my head (such as people jumping from buildings, fire and explosions,etc).  I was having nightmares up to about two days ago.  In general, I still remain very tired from both lack of sleep and stress.  I am worried about what will happen in the future, whether or not there will be a war.  I cannot say that I am in favor of a war, because I think it will only lead to further death and destruction.  There are too many scary weapons out there that culd be used against the US, so I think it would be worth the time it takes to find another solution to the problem.  I still feel a bit of sadness.  So many people died for what seemed like no reason.  My heart goes out to them and thier families.  I remain grateful that I am still here and that I have my family.  Luckily, no one I immediately know was killed.  If anything, I am hoping that we as a society will learn from this disaster.  I am hoping that I too will remember how precious life is and that I should be grateful for what I have.  Things will never be the same.  It is uplifting to me to see my community pull together to help in the rescue efforts (such as sending money, donating blood, etc).  I have noticed that people are just a little nicer to strangers than they were before.  I find myself more concious of those around me.  It is good to know that the country is pulling together.  My roommates and I joined the rest of our neighborhood in putting candles on the porches.  It helped a little to know that others cared.\"They feel that they were wronged in some way.

'Osama Bin Laden and the Al-queada \"I feel that a memeber of the military, I am more at risk than ever before to deploy or even have my installation attacked (i.e., the Twin Towers and Pentagon).  I do not think that any behaviors have changed, I still open my mail.  Unlike somepeople that I know who wear gloves.\"They attacked the United States because they do not like our countries beliefs and attitudes and our desire to elp others.\"The morning of September 11th, I was on my way to work when I heard over the radio that an airplane had just crashed into the Twin Towers.  I thought that it was a joke.  After going into the local convience store, I heard that the second tower had been hit.  I was in complete shock.  I got to work and my LT (I am a memmber if the US Army) told me that we had been attacked.  Our entire section was in  a close huddle around a small radio listening for the latest updates as they came.  Soldiers all around me were agry and upset, yelling that they were ready to go get whoever was responsible for this terrible act.  I called my husband on the telephone (also a soldier in the US Army), he was crying on the phone telling me that both of the Twin Towers had crumbled to the ground and that the pentagon had been hit.  He told me of the pain he was feeling as he watched it crumble to the ground and that he saw people jumping out of the building.  Needless to say my instalation was locked down and we all spoke of the event for days, weeks, and months after.  We continue to speak of it and our anger and desire to go over there and kick some butt.    \"\"It is hard, even still, to believe.  It is impossible for me to understand how anyone or any group could justify such an action.  To take the lives of any, but so many, innocent people who were merely going about their lives is beyond comprehension. My heart goes out to those injured, and those who have lost loved ones.  I am grateful to those firefighters, police and  ordinary  who tried to rescue others, even though I personally lost no one in the tragedy.  I am grateful to those on flight 93 who prevented further losses. At noon that day, I walked with a friend over the lunch hour.  It was sunny, bright and beautiful, and reminded me that, in spite of what happened, there is still beauty and good in the world.  I came home and night and held my 18 year old daughter in my lap.  It comforted both of us.  I called my 21 year old son who was maybe 5 miles away, just to let him know I was thinking of him and to reassure myself he was ok.  Irrational, but.... I hated the feeling of wanting revenge that welled up inside me.  I   was glad it was specific to the perpetrators, not generalized to an entire ethnic, cultural or religious group.  I fear there will be, as there has been, random violence against muslims or arabs or people who someone thinks may be.  That doesn\'t solve the problem and only perpetuates it. I think our lives will never be the same.  I don\'t think this is the end of it.  There will be more incidents, perhaps using different methods.  I don\'t want my children to live in fear.  I cannot imagine how people cope in countries where terrorist acts and atrocities occur regularly.  I may find out.   I am proud of our country\'s pulling together.  I am proud of my childrens\' responses.  They are thoughtful, not knee-jerk, not  chill .  I feel more connection to family and friends.  I feel more patriotic  (I was very much against the Vietnam war and have tended to be skeptical and a bit suspicious about our government ever since).  I did not vote for Bush, but feel this is the time to support our leadership (intelligently, not blindly) rather than look for every opportunity to criticize. I want to do something positive and helpful.  I started by donating money to the red cross.  I will look for other opportunities.\"\"It is hard to fathom.  Intellectually, I would say either hatred, fanaticism or both.\"\"I imagine Osama bin Ladin and his group, but with support from others, such as Saddam Hussein\"I have watched more TV and listened to more news radio.Hatred and lack of honoring humanity.The men who devised this plan in their hearts and carried it out.\"Mostly sadness, that we live in a world where the will to be so cruel even exists.  My own sense of the world has never been that there was much sense of safety, and these events have only confirmed for me that we are all in the same position.  And I don\'t know how I can alter that reality, so I feel discouraged.\"I have tried to show more love to the people in my life.\"Good question.  The easy answer would be because they hate American wealth and power.  I suspect the real reason is somewhat more complicated and is dependent upon the perpetrator.  We\'d have to look at each of the individual culprits.  Why would anyone hijack a plane?  Why would they be willing to die to kill other people?  Why would, if indeed bin Laden is the planner and funder for the attacks, this very complicated attack be planned at all?  And what in the world could he hope to accomplish?  I have more questions than I do answers . . . . \"The ONLY name I\'ve heard through the vast amounts of media is Osama bin Laden.  I don\'t have any other information.....and I don\'t know what real evidence exists as it remains classified and not open to the public.  \"I don\'t even know if I have a perspective.   When I heard about the first plane hitting the tower, I thought it was probably about a little Cessna, a big wind, a small hole in a big building, maybe someone was severely injured, perhaps even killed.   As I learned more details, I could only watch the news reports with horror.  Hand covering my mouth, stomach in knots, knowing that the world as I\'d always known it had suddenly changed very dramatically. I continue to worry about how my daughter\'s life will be affected by these events.  Every day, the newspaper headlines warn us of impending disasters and wars and serve to incubate the anxieties of our country.  It\'s hard to even get a handle on the sheer amount of devastation.  I heard this morning that it\'s 16 acres of debris, over 6300 missing and presumed dead, hundreds more dead as a result of being on the aircrafts or in the Pentagon.   I find it difficult to maintain any sort of perspective at all related to these events.  If nothing else, it\'s certainly brought home how inter-related we, as humans on earth, are.  Everyone knows someone who was directly affected.  People are killed, buildings are devastated, whole businesses are gone, major airlines suffer huge losses, people stop flying, tourism suffers, people lose jobs, economy loses confidence.  I am awed at the colossal amount of collateral damage.  \"\"None.  I continue to be a bit depressed, a bit more intolerant of people getting ticked off over the trivial stuff, a bit more appreciative of my family....\"Osama Bin Laden and followers\"hatred, jealousy, ignorance, insanity\"\"Words cannot express my feelings.  Thankfully, I did not lose anyone in the disaster.  However, I am very concerned about those who did.  I try to imagine how they must feel.  It saddens me to think of the loss of so many wonderful people.  I often think about the terror the vitims on the planes must have felt.  I have been glued to the tv since the attack, but must admit that as days pass, my initial curiosity is replaced with fear.  I experienced nightmares on Sunday after the tragedy.  Afterwards, I made the decision not to watch as much television.  I work in psychiatry, and wonder how many will develop PTSD.  I am moved by the many stories I have seen on tv, and moved by the reactions of people who have seemed so strong, so emotion-free.  For instance, I watched David Letterman last night.  Dan Rather was his first guest and he became tearful on two occasions.  The other story that stands out in my mind is the one of the CEO of Canter Fitzgerald.  Finally, I am shocked by the hatred that these terrorists feel for the U.S. We must do something to put an end to terrorism. (I apologize for the lack of organization in what I just wrote-I just typed as thoughts came to me).\"increased awareness in my interactions with those around me  increased television watching  crying over the loss of thousands of lives worry and concern over what is to come\"The  way of life  in the US and our  export  of that way of life through pop culture is a threat to  the control that extremists have in the mid-east.  Additionally, the bold exertion that the US makes on  other nations raises disdain for our  supremicy  world wide. \"I am saddened in general and less  optomistic  about the world we live in.  I worry about the legacy we leave for our children.\"I can only base my suspicion on the news media, which reports that Ben Laden and his followers are responsible.  However, I am not  positive that the government is not intentionally steering the public in that direction. \"\"I find myself terribly conflicted about the events of September 11th.  Part of that conflict is due to the public reactions against  foreigners.   As a Jew and as a 2nd generation American, I am  horrified by the outrageous acts of so-called  patriots  who harass and even attack people who are  ethnic  in appearance -- particularly those who appear to be Middle Eastern.  I am also conflicted  because, while I want to see justice done, I fear that an attack on Afganistan will degenerate into a Islam holy war against the  west  in general.  Israel\'s tentative balance is almost a greater concern than the security of those of us in America.  I believe that the USA will be able to preserve our relative security, but I fear that the security of Israel, which is of critical importance to Jews in diaspora around the globe, grows more and more tentative.  Any US attack on Islam or it\'s followers will reverberate on the Israelis and Jews worldwide.\"bin LadinGuiltyPrayers are back in schools.  More people are realizing that there is a God.\"I think God is showing us how we are supposed to be living.  We had gotten so caught up in our everyday life that we had put Him on the back burner of lives.  People are sending emails asking where was God when this terrible event occured.  Well, I know that my God was there!  I am a Christian and I\'m positive that God will use this according to His will.\"\"My feelings are one of  terrorism has finally caught up with us.   I\'m just surprised that it took this long.  Sadly, it\'s a door opening - a door opening to lifestyle changes in America, terrorism on American soil, and continued conflict across the world. Regardless of what considers the cause to be - Islamic fundamentalism, American foreign policy and the resentment it has caused - there is no easy solution and so many will suffer. My feelings are of overwhelming sadness and an inability to comprehend a just and speedy solution.\"I am very hesitant to travel and have delayed a business trip.\"This is a tough question.  It\'s a combination of things - retaliation against Western political and cultural influence, misuse of the concepts of jihad or fatwa for personal gain, cruelty...\"I believe that terrorists are responsible for the attacks likely with the support of many other organizations or perhaps even governments\"The 11th of September was the first working day of my Iranian jewish boyfriend after waiting many monhts for a working permit. Now we are waiting for his stay permit so that we can fled from Europe if things go worse. But to where? We recently learned that there is no security in this world, just on the moment whe thought everything would be allright the WTC thing happened. We are afraid that for burocracy reasons my boy friend will not get a new stay permit. This means that general ethical feelings (nobody deserves misery) go against private interest (hopefully the situation in Iran gets worse so that they can not send him back). The way refugees or non US/European immigrants are treated show very well that the world is divided in \'east\' and \'west\', \'rich\' and \'poor\' or however you want to call it. I am of the side of the  winners  but I am ashamed about the arrogance of  my  part of the world. I am not religious but I can fully understand why terrorists do what they do. This is does not mean that I am happy with their deeds. Terrorism and Western world egoism are like earthquakes and hurricanes, we can only do our best to avoid to be victim but never eliminate them. \"More prudent in public places. \"Probably muslim extremists but I am not sure. War in Afghanistan makes me think of a joke in which a drunk man is looking for his fallen keys near a lamp post.  Are you sure you lost them there?  asks somebody.  No, but here I can search better because there is more light than over there.  \"Draw the attention: there is something damned wrong with this world. Not necessarily for religious reasons.\"Because they are jealous of us, although that makes no sense at all\"\"I have always been proud to be an American, an Italian American actually\"Osama Bin Ladin\"I remember watching TV and feeling a big lump in my stomach. I had to stop watching, espespecially the footage of the planes hitting the towers. I had the urge to go get my children out of school, just so that I could be sure that they were safe. My father, who is almost 79 years old, just summed it all up for me when I went over his house that day. He said,  This is not good.  He just shook his head. It just all seemed like it was unbelieveable. Outside, it was a beautiful warm and sunny day, and it was hard to imagine the horrific scenes that were going on hours away from me in distance.

'\"Unbelieve and fear, these where the initial emotions I experienced when I heard the horrible news. I turned on CNN and couldn\'t believe my eyes. What the hell is going on and why???!!!! I also tried to reach CNN by internet, but that was impossible.I watched tv over two hours and got more and more depressed. I had to turn the tv off, couldn\'t take it anymore, and feeling guilty over it, \'cause my feelings were nothing compared to the feelings of the people involved. Can\'t imagine what the peoples in the planes must have thought, when they were notified of the plane being hijacked, or the eye-witnesses, of the people who worked in the Twin Towers, Wall Street or the Pentagon, the relatives and friends whose loved ones are missing or dead en so on and on.  A day later, I talked about it, but at the end of the afternoon, I noticed that I was starting to avoid conversations about it, and consciously didn\'t turn on the tv or radio (ostrichpolicy... if you don\'t talk and think about it, it isn\'t there . Too bad, it is...) However the following days, I kept on reading the papers, also American papers on the internet, hoping the American government wouldn\'t rush into an not-thought-well-through revenge action. And so far, they haven\'t.  I fear a Third World War, with with incalculable consequences: more terror-attacks over the world or a chemical war. I truly hope that the government of the United States of America first come with evidence, previous to any revenge-attacks. Have a case first, before you start e.g. bombing Afghanistan, cause you think that Bin Laden did it, or you think that he\'s there. In America, everyone is not guilty, unless proven otherwise, so I hope that they keep that in mind.\"\"more afraid of planes, more consciously aware of my environment, try not to generalize moslims too much as fundamental sick lunatics.  Interesting to see that I don\'t want to pinpoint down the responsible one(s) for the attack, but notice that I have a bit trouble with seeing moslims in a positive, respectfull way...\"\"show America (and the Western world) that they are not the only mighty nations??

Question: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE WORD RESPECT??    \"\"Hard to say, no clear evidence. However, I think that there is a big chance a fundamental moslim group (or groups) (Afghanistan??) is (are) behind the attacks. But what I said before, no clear evidence.\"\"I am concerned about world peace.  I acknowledge that my country (USA) is a wealthy country and uses its wealth to  push its weight around  at times.  But, it is also a caring country that has sent aid to many other countries in their time of need.

I went out for my walk and when I came home, I saw the horror of what was happening just a few miles from home (I live on Long Island, NY).  Tears came to my eyes as I knew I was witnessing the deaths of some of my neighbors and friends.  Terror struck with the realization that my brother Patrick, who works for the Port Authority, and his daughter Michelle, a sophomore at Fordam University at Lincoln Center, were both in Manhattan at that time. I only learned late that night that the two of them were safe. Patrick, who works for the Port Authority at the Bus Terminal, uptown from the WTC, was on the telephone at about 8:55am with his good friend Joe who was working at the P.A. office in Tower 1.  Joe had just told Patrick that they had an earthquake. Patrick told Joe that that was impossible; that he was less than a mile away and hadn\'t felt anything. Joe told Patrick that everyone at the Tower 1 office agreed: the terrific, shaking jolt must have been an earthquake. What else could it have been? Then the line went dead. Nobody has heard from Joe since. Michele is a 19 year old sophomore at Fordham Univ. who was walking up 7th Ave. from Penn Station. She is bright but shy, and is studying to be an attorney; her ultimate goal is to become a judge. Michelle dislikes birds immensely. She always has. What Michelle noticed as she walked up 7th Ave. was the tremendous number of pigeons flying overhead northward, towards the Bronx. Many of the birds came down and landed in fountains, trying to clean debris off their backs. Michelle just couldn\'t understand where so many of these pigeons were headed. She only learned of the disaster when she arrived at school. I am worried about the kind of world that our children will grow up in.  Will they be able to spend their formative years learning and dreaming about their future, or will they instead need to focus on remaining safe and enduring nightmare after nightmare?  I want to make people aware of the suffering of all people in an attempt to pool resources to alleviate as much of it as we can. I am frustrated and angry that some of the most agregious acts of inhumanity have been committed under the guise of religion. I am scared.\"\"If you are angry enough, and feel disempowered enough, and don\'t value your own life, and have enough resources to recruit others like yourself and then recruit the young and disenfranchised, you can do just about anything.  If you feel that your enemy is any nation that has more than you do, it is easy to turn  them  into objects.  Once a human is made into an object, you can do anything to him or her.\"\"Actually, they haven\'t to any great extent.  When I ride the subway or walk the streets, I am no more cautious than I usually am.  However, I live near an Arab American shopping district and I don\'t plan to be  shopping there (out of fear of others\' acts of  retaliation ).  I also do feel a greater need to be near home.\"\"Numerous fundamentalist Muslim terrorists who live in any number of countries.  The U.S. supplied some of these groups with money, training, and arms in order to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.  I think there\'s enough blame to go around the world.   \"\"I am afraid, but I feel numb.  I keep having to remind myself of the reality of what happened.  Every morning when I wake up I have to remember that the Trade Center is gone and that thousands of people are dead.   I live in southern Brooklyn and don\'t live far away from the site of the attack.  I was watching it on TV and at the same time my apartment was filling with smoke.  Birds were swarming and pieces of paper were falling out of the sky.  I keep trying to remember what I was feeling as it was happening and I can\'t. I\'ve been wandering through my days, pretending that I\'m alive.  Everything feels irrelevant, but I persist in doing my work, talking with friends and carrying on with life.\"The foreign nations that support terrorism.Nothing has really changed for me personally.They would because of their belief practices and things that they were taught to believe.\"I am truly shocked.  I never envisioned anything that tragic happening so  quickly in the US.  Not only was I really shocked but I also felt a great deal of  saddness for the victims whose lives were so innocently lost.  The event has changed the way that I viewed the US, in terms of making me  realize that tragic events certainly can happen anywhere at anytime.\"\"Terrorists who hate us because of things we as a nation have done in arrogance; Terrorists who are simply evil and/or crazy; our own government for missing so many opportunities to have stopped this tragedy; the airlines for being so greedy as to provide little or no security; past policies of our nation which failed to comprehend the situation in the middle east, which simplistically and immorally propped up dictators and thugs as long as they were not communists.\"\"I am angry that this tragedy has occurred. I am angry at the FBI and CIA for missing so many clues that something was going on. I am angry at the airlines for being so greedy that they failed to provide adequate security for airline passengers, and now they have the nerve to expect to be bailed out of their financial problems. Why should we fly when we know they are so lax about security? I am angry at George Bush for being so woefully inadequate and for being in way over his head. How can we take the moral high ground as a  democracy  when we so recently held a rigged election in our own country and the person who won the election is not the President? Our own hypocrisy and corruption are catching up with us. We treat sex as recreation, women as objects, obsess about the personal lives of the celebrity of the moment, allow our children to grow up too soon, to watch violence in all its forms and to dress like hookers and we wonder why we offend people of other cultures. I am a Mormon and I have great faith in God and in family. Yesterday I found out that my daughter is pregnant with her third child. I am afraid for that child and for my two granddaughters. I am normally a very optimistic person and now I feel as I did after the deaths of both of my parents within months of each other - there is a darkness about life which frightens me and I don\'t know if I\'m strong enough to  endure to the end.  I know this feeling will pass, but for the moment I am angry and frightened and struggling to understand how such evil and our simplistic reaction to it can exist. I hope that we do not overreact, that we do not cause innocents to suffer to assuage our  pride.  I fear a masculinist ethic, epitomized by George Bush and his advisers, is overtaking our culture again. I fear we may be on the road to World War III, and that those in charge of our nation do not have the same values as I do and will take us there far too easily. \"\"I think they truly believe we are evil and they are justified. They believe God is with them. Some of them are simply evil, some are simply thugs. We have interfered in the affairs of other nations for our own benefit and out of an arrogance which never imagined we would someday have to pay for our actions. We have created great resentment for our meddling, for our support of Israel, and for our immoral culture which we send out to permeate the world.\"\"I need to go back to New Jersey at some point this fall and I am very much afraid to do so. I am thinking up reasons to put it off, and have even tried to come up with a way to avoid going at all. I have avoided going into the nearest city (San Francisco) for fear of attacks there. \"Bin Ladin and Sudam HusainBecasue they hate America because we are so prosperous and they feel we need to be brought down.iwatch the news all the time adn i talk to my family a lot more often.It scared me to death.  I used to wake up feeling safe because nothing could happen to me because i live in the U.S.  The terrorists ruined that adn i hate them for that.  I feel we need to fight back.\"Because they are monsters, and do not support American Culture in any way what so ever, feeling that we are  the devil and need to be killed\"\"I know I look at Middle Easterns differently now, and I also haven\'t looked at a picture of the skyline of NYC yet,I am much more patriotic then I was before, and I try to watch the news as little as possible.\"Osama Bin Laden\"Being that it affected me very close to home, as my father was in the Towers at the time they were attacked and he thankfully got out on time before being injured, I am very upset about the whole thing. I go a university in the South and thus it is very hard to explain  some of my feelings to people down here because most have never been  to NY and aren\'t attached and don\'t understand how crazy it is.  NY  has been a HUGE part of my life for almost my whole life, my father  had worked in the Towers for almost 20 years, and I had been going in with him several times throughout the year.  Take your daughter to  work day, or just days when we would go and he would work half a day  and then we would do something in the city.  I just can\'t believe that they are gone.  They weren\'t just buildings to me, they were a  symbol of New York, the NYC I knew.  In a way I guess I\'m glad that I am so far away from what happened, I couldn\'t imagine going to school in the city, like I wanted to orginally.  When I went home the same  weekend of the week of the attacks, the feelings were so different...I guess it\'s because most people have been to NY.  People that my family hasn\'t spoken to in years, called the house or stopped by to make sure my father has stopped by.  This weekend, my family is having an open  house so people can just stop by have some food and see my father, as  so many people just want to see him for themselves.  I know how they  feel, even after I had spoken to my father at my Aunt\'s house, because he couldn\'t get home until the next day, we don\'t live far away from  the city, maybe an hour and 15 minutes, but everything was so messed  up that he couldn\'t get home.  I still wanted to see him with my own eyes.  The whole thing really just hit my family very hard.  My whole family is from NYC...Long Island, Brooklyn, Queens...my sister and I  are the only two in my whole extended family that weren\'t born there. My father has never been away from the city for long.  Now he swears, that he will never go back, never work in the city again.  I just  can\'t believe that.  I also feel, even though I know I shouldn\'t, that all middle eastern people are awful...I haven\'t done anything, like  not gone to a resturant because one is working there, but when I hear about people doing that, I don\'t get upset, even though I feel like I  should.  I know that if I was flying I wouldn\'t want some one from the Middle East on the plane with me...even though I know that most  are not of the same group, or even believe the same things...I just would not want to do it.  I do love the way that America is pulling together, and how everyone is being very patriotic...that really makes me happy.  It makes me feel better.  I am very thankful that my family is one of the lucky ones, as I know that so many people were not... I just talked to my mother yesterday and now, the family is finally   getting back to normal .  My sister and her husband and their baby are also starting to get back to normal.  Being a Psych. student, I  was worried about my father\'s mental health, so I brought him a whole bunch of stuff on PTSD and a journal, and I am still very surprised that not only did he read everything, but he is using his journal, and he took the stuff into the office that they are now using and had the overall manager copy and distribute the info. to all of the employees. I myself feel like I am also starting to get back to normal, however,  I haven\'t looked at a picture of the city without the towers yet,  which, I know I have to do soon.\"\"Initially, I was extremely shocked and depressed by so many violent deaths.   The numbness/paralysis persisted for a couple weeks -- felt very anti-social,  daily routines seemed trite, a waste of time. Was constantly thinking about the WTC.  Recognized  that what friends in New York were directly experiencing was what I\'ve  always expected/dreaded in a major earthquake here (minus the lunatic cause). I relived the grief of the sudden losses of loved ones in my own life. My heart was warmed by tales of heroism, strangers being nice to each other. In contrast, was outraged by early TV images of Palestinians celebrating the WTC atrocity. While I continued to feel horrified/depressed by the genocidal events of September 11, I was almost equally horrified/depressed by the response of various commercial interests and individuals in this country within the first 48 hours of the attack.  Certain networks constantly replaying the planes crashing into the towers with melodramatic music like some moronic video game. Rescue workers loudly chanting  USA, USA, USA  for the cameras as if they were at a football game.  T-shirts, postcards, jingoistic flags, etc. being hawked for quick profit.  Internet scammers seeing an opportunity to make easy money on fake  contribute to the recovery  sites. Gas stations in the Midwest tripling the price of gasoline to gouge as many paranoid people as possible.  Healing  rock concerts. What\'s going on with all these fellow  patriotic  citizens??? How does a flag represent grief, or is a battle call more important  than grieving? Rockstars singing  God bless America  on TV -- who cares what  camera-ready celebrities feel? All I could think about was what the  families, friends, and coworkers of victims must be going through.  Was it just me who felt both disgusted and embarrassed by the tasteless  commercial responses? I can\'t imagine for a minute that any of the relatives or friends of the 5000+ people who were murdered would indulge in any of these behaviors. How shameful that so many indirectly affected people in our society find sports-like entertainment in such an ugly event. I do feel sorry for most Afghans and hope the US military stops bombing soon and  neutralizes Al-Qaida through ground forces. I find the bombings depressing just as much as I did during the Gulf War. The food drops are small consolation. It\'s still unbelievable that a handful of young male idiots would kill thousands  to get a frontrow seat in paradise with a bonus of 72 virgins -- the notion is  definitely making me a born-again feminist atheist. HOW can people be so stupid  and cruel???  How can any educated person entertain the infantile fantasy of a  personal god and eternal life? Am feeling more annoyed now by all emblems of  faith  -- fish symbols on cars, crosses around necks, yarmulkes, turbans and chadirs -- people  stuck in the superstitions of the Middle Ages -- they\'re ALL scary, all potential  social menaces with their irrational belief systems.  And what is it about our society, so many  loving  churchgoers like Bush, that we can deplore the senseless violence of last month\'s terrorist acts, then spend billions annually to be entertained by violent  action  films and games?  Who believes that there\'s absolutely no connection between our complacent acceptance of violent entertainment and the ruthless actions of Islamic fundamentalists or the Timothy McVeighs of the world? Should we be grateful that Warner Bros. et al. decided to postpone release or broadcast of violent films during the past  month or is it time to establish a national mental detox center, preferably secular, that would extinguish the appeal of such forms of violent entertainment, and ultimately, Hollywood\'s revenue stream/incentive to produce such products?  Ideally, studios would just eat the cost and never release movies like  Collateral Damage . But realistically, we know that\'s unlikely to happen. I only hope that more Americans will think twice in the future before buying tickets to these adrenalin-fix movies or buying themselves or their kids violent video and computer games.  Many have said that this atrocity will change this country forever, but personally, I\'m not so sure that our materialistic, violence-hooked culture is presently capable of any significant social change. I feel no fear for my own life -- no hesitation to take a flight across  the country next Tuesday. \"Osama bin Hitler\"Have simplified my lifestyle, lost interest in advancing my career\"\"hatred, greed for power\"',4,-5,0,2,5,0,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,1.88,2.15,0.54,1.08,0,8.61,0,0.54,0,0,0,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,5.39,3.23,0,0.54,6.46,0.54,0,0,7.27,0,0,0,1.08,0.27,0,1.88,0,37.43,0,3.5,0,0,0.54,0,0.54,0,49.02,2.15,0,6.46,0,0,0,0.54,0,1.08,0,1.62,0,0.27,0,12.12,11.59,1.62,1.08,0.54,0,4.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0.54,1.35,Female
'\"This is far from certain - perhaps it could be an Arab terrorist organisation, perhaps an individual.\"\"While the events of the 11th are regretable for the families of the 7000+ people who have died, the response of the US government has been equally appauling.   If violence is responded to by more violence then a vicious circle develops.   In years to come the US and UK will pay via international aid agreements to reconstruct the very intrastructures such as airports that they are bombing in Afganistan today.   Today Bush announced the 22 most wanted terrorists.   They do not mention any European terror groups that have caused appauling death and injury on a smaller scale.   The UK government do not bomb Belfast every time the IRA or another irish splinter group have acted in violence.   \"Behaviours have not changed.   I do not feel a target and do not know anyone directly involved in the disaster.  I feel empathy for the families of the dead but I also feel opposed to the action that the US and UK have taken.   So called civilised societies are supposed to set an example to the less democratic.   The response is a good example of the US responding to an extrenal threat to capitalism as opposed to a threat to its own people.\"I very much doubt that whoever organised the event of the 11th would have imagined in their wildest dreams to have been able to be successful in causing the widescale damage that was possible.  It is obvious that it is someone who has some dead seated political hatred of the US, capitalism and all it represents.   While the events of the 11th are tragic in their own right, the oppression that the US and UK have shown to third world countries makes it hardly surprising.\"\"Who?  The terrorists themselves and their backers are directly responsible, but the forces shaping the situations that shaped the terrorists go back at least to the end of WWII and the cold war, and are traceable to policy decisions made by the US and USSR, among others.  Take an embattled, impoverished, and suffering people, add fanaticism, get a raging horror.  The seeds  of WWII and the rise of Nazism were sown at Versailles.  Under these circumstances, almost anything that can serve as an excuse or justification for designating some other group of people as  different  and committing atrocities against them eventually will...\"Because they don\'t know what else to do &/or feel they have nothing to lose.\"First I thought it was a joke--then I switched radio stations and realized it wasn\'t.  Then I felt kind of nauseous.  Then I wondered how long it would take Jamie Pennebaker to get a study up and running on this.  (Seriously, I did.)  I had a lecture to get through, so I tried not to think about it much more until later.  Then for about a week I thought of nothing else, although I didn\'t want to discuss it.  I especially worried about Muslims and Arab-Americans being treated badly.  I avoided email and making calls to check on people out of fear of bad news for at a week.  I have since found out that no one I know was directly affected.  This avoidance was a source of low morale, because I usually function very well in crises, by focusing on helping others.  I keep thinking of this as an opportunity to develop some international consensus on curtailing the use of violence and hoping that the US will take the  high road  and not squander this chance that has been purchased with the deaths of thousands.\"\"I try to smile and greet people more, especially the Lebanese guys at the convenience store.  I keep forgetting to eat and getting dizzy.  I try to distract myself by reading books about things like epidemics, population genetics, and philosophy of science.\"More alert to what is going on around me.  Sleep and digestive problems are more intense than before.Can not fathom.I was absolutely devastated as I viewed the attack.  I can\'t begin to fathom what kind of minds would conceive of a plan.  These individuals have absolutely no regard for human life even their own. It is wonderful to see how everyone has united against this kind of terror.  It\'s too bad that it took something so tragic as this to make many of us appreciate what we have.Osama bin Laden\"Logistically, that is the act itself, a group of radical extremists. Morally, well, there things get complicated.  The radical extremists are directly responsible, but then there is the notion of accountability, which opens up a whole can of cultural worms.  Did the US  deserve  this? No.  Are they involved in the cultural psychology that fostered the event, I think so.\"\"Despair, for one -- if one believes one\'s own way of life is being destroyed by Western ideology.  Hatred, wrought by envy of a society which has so much when one has so little.  Hatred of  the Other   -- xenophobia.\"\"I was already in a reflective state about how I need to simplify my life when the attacks happened.  If anything, I am more intensely working on how I might do that.  So, I am  trying to use less water, less electricity, etc.  I am not a big TV watcher, but after that initial few days of news watching as so many people did, I am trying to restrict my TV news watching to 1 hour -- 30 minutes of local; 30 minutes of national.  I do find I am reading the Internet news services more carefully -- somehow -- because I can control how much I read, and because I do not hear the inflection of the announcer\'s voice, I think I am better able to assess the validity of what I am  receiving. \"\"I guess you could say I am a pragmatist.  As an educator, I  have a great belief in people\'s potential to better them selves intellectually, morally, physically, etc -- but as as a person, I am a realist and tend to expect the worst.   So the 11 Sept attacks, while they horrified me and leave  me grieving, did not leave me disillusioned or thinking  Oh no, will I ever be safe again?   I have never thought our society safe and have struggled with the prevailing attitude portrayed by the media.  Surely, I think to myself, we Americans are not  that  naive. Several things  do  concern me, in the aftermath: 1)  the media -- I think the news information networks are fueling personal as well as  political anxiety.  It is not reflective, only reactive. And I don\'t hold to the  public\'s right to know  mantra -- I need to be kept informed, yes, but I don\'t need to know every detail.  And what I WANT to know, the perspective of other nations and cultures, I either do not get or get through a filter.  Also, after having lived in DC for nearly a decade, and teaching writing, I am fairly cynical when it comes to believing  anything  that comes out of a politian\'s mouth. I find myself conflicted -- wanting to be informed and yet at the same time not beliving anything the media reports the various leaders as saying. 2) the rise of patriotism -- I understand the need to feel secure and  with  others.  The much-seen flag waving often seem to me to be expressing this emotional need.  As for patriotism  itself, I am truly frightened with what seems to be an  equating of patriotism with religion.  I am also very  concerned that critical discussion or observations or complaints are regarded as non-patriotic.  The willingness to ignore, censor, or deny anything that isn\'t A-!, red- white-and-blue-mom-apple-pie is considered suspect.  The issues at stake are not black and white; there are shades of   grey, subtleties which are being ignored. 3) the closing of public debate -- (for lack of a better way  to term it).  I was intrigued to read in a newspaper article a few days ago(the New York Times, I think)comments by  several African Americans regarding racial profiling.  These few individuals decided they approved it for Arabs -- yet there was no reflection on their part on how their fears might be comparable to White fears that lead to the racial profiling of Blacks -- and I wondered did other African Americans and Whites read this and did it make them think about the way racial profiling is fear driven; did it make them want to talk talk to each other; did it make them want to talk about it with their children? I hope the 11 Sept events might move us to be more reflective about our society\'s assumptions  about such things as race, or our affluence with regard to other countries who lack, or how deep, rich religious and political cultures such as Islam, Christianity, Judaism, etc. might proactive co-exist. But having said that, I do not expect it. Finaly, I struggle to think what I can do -- not simply in response to the 11 Sept events -- though the events have intensified such thoughts for me.  I am only one person, with no immediate access to political power.  (I am an educator but currently not teaching as I finish my dissertation, so I don\'t even have students to talk with to perhaps help there.) At this point, the best thing I can do is listen to those needing to talk, care for those needing comfort, and be prompt in contributing my thoughts to the dialogue when it does happen in a way I can become involved in. The kind of anger I am feeling is towards  anyone  who feels their beliefs must be the beliefs of all.  I am also struggling with ethical concerns:  how our affluent society is so at the expense of so many other societies; how military action caries with it a rhetoric that is so all  or nothing; and how difficult it is to live mindfully, or spiritually, in a culture (American, I mean) that tends to stress the materialistic. I thank your group for the opportunity to share my thoughts and concerns. \"\"I have not really changed any of my behaviors, I refuse to allow this to change my ideals and way of life because then the terrorists suceeded\"Ben Laden and his followers did so to make a statement and make a point (their disapproval of Americans ideals and ways of lifeBen Laden and his followers\"I truly believe this is a world wide tragedy.  However, it seems to be bringing not only our nation, but also the world in general together in a coomon effort.  Although it has many negative reprecussions, it also has served as a positive event.   \"\"I\'ve sincerely tried to be more cautious about what I say, so as to respect all persons opinions on this subject matter.  I rearranged my schedule for one of my courses to include a speaker from the county office on emergency preparedness.  My husband is a civilian who works for a major company that contracts most of its business to the Navy...that concerns me in ways I probably still don\'t know\"\"I can only answer this based on what the media has provided me and that would include a group of individuals, radical in nature, from several countries in the Middle East, who have sorely misrepresented their  religious  beliefs.\"\"I was horrified and am still, one week later, walking around in amazement and disbelief. I keep thinking this has to be a movie because I wasn\'t prepared and can\'t conceive that an attack such as this could take place here in the U.S. I\'ve grown up feeling that wars and the Depression were a part of my grandparents\' generation not mine!  Even experiencing some of the Persian Gulf several years ago, was much less dramatic(although significant and important), because of where it was fought.   Teaching college students has been as much of a challenge as I hear it hs been for  elementary school teachers.  Everyone wants some sense of security restored.\"\"It still boggles my mind but my guess is due to pure anger and hatred for something they don\'t clearly understand. It must also stem from jealousy over what we as Americans possess: freedom,  opportunities, and pride in our country\"\"I think Bin Lauden is involved, but I also think that some of these terrorists are from our ali countries.  \"\"Simply stupidity.  To purposely take someones life, especially innocent people, is nothing, but EVIL!\"\"It\'s a hard reality to face.  I\'m in the National Guard, and I\'ll be commissioned in May 2002 as a 2LT.  In the military this is exactly what they train us to do.  To plan these type of operations.  It was amazing to see one carried out almost perfectly.  But I am still in shock.  Knowing that so many innocent people died because of craziness.  As mad as I am, I don\'t feel it is a good idea to send ground troops over there.  We are not equiped to fight them on that terrain.  More importantly, we still can\'t get the man we want.  Bin Lauden.  We\'ve tried for years to get him, and Sadam but still no results.  On top of that we are not positive as to exactly who we are fighting.  I know they say its the Alcada, and the Taliban but there are more people involved in this than that.  We have not evaluated the situation completely, and are reacting immaturely.  America wants quick results, but if we send our troops over there and we get masacred then people will changed their minds.  America will be upset because we had so many casualties, but yet they want us to jump into this war.  I think we need to take more time to build our citizen of New York back up first.  I know we have people volunteering, but they had definitely gone through a serious trauma.  \"\"I\'ve strated watching the News more, and trying to be aware of the culture around me.  But I\'ve also tried to let our Pakastinian citizen know that they are still safe here.  \"\"Damn good question.  I\'d like to know the answer. Out of anger.  Jealousy, perhaps, that life in the US is much better than in many Muslim countries.\"\"Initially, of course, I felt shock and fear most strongly.  The initial fear dissipated upon hearing that all my family and friends were safe, and the shock wore off as the images were played over (and over) on the tv, internet, and in the papers.  But I\'m still apprehensive--my boyfriend is flying today (23 Oct) to Australia, and I won\'t be able to breathe easily until I know he\'s arrived safely.  I\'m equally nervous about travelling over the holidays. But a large part of me is just confused about things in general.  Out of the hundreds of millions (billions?) of Muslims in the world, how many feel this way toward Americans?  Why do they feel this way?  I somehow doubt that I would be able to have my questions answered; I assume (perhaps wrongfully so) that these are not rational people.  I also wonder about the non-fanatical/terrorist Muslims, particularly here in America.  How do they feel?  What do they think would drive their \'fellow Muslims\' to do such a thing?\"Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda network.\"I\'m more alert to my surroundings, more apprehensive about travelling. \"\"I don\'t know anything really, besides what I hear on the news.  If they know the people that did this, then they better get them...but besides putting a face on the people responsible for this, I believe it was someone that has no morals, no ethics, no belief in any type of God.  \"\"I\'m not sure how I feel about the events that happened two weeks ago, today.  I know I\'m still hurt, and still shocked.  It almost feels like it never happened.  Reality starts to hit when I see the pictures again on the news, or when I get off the train station at Union Square and I see the candles and pictures of the missing people.  It\'s hard to take it all in.  It wasn\'t fair, and that\'s the only way I can describe it.  I don\'t understand why it happened.  I don\'t care if some people hate America.  How can you do something like this to people?  Human beings like everyone else in the world.  I can\'t start to think why people would take there time and money and put so much effort into killing so many people.  I\'m glad I can\'t think that way.  I wouldn\'t want to be able to.  I know the United States will retaliate, but I just don\'t want to see the rising number of people dying because of these attacks.  I went to the New York Mets game on Friday, and it was beautiful.  People really are standing by eachother and it\'s refreshing to see how people care.  It was also disturbing waiting on line to have our bags searched just to get into the staduim.  Look at what these people did to us.  Not only did they kill thousands of people, ruin valuable treasures to New Yorkers, but they made us scared, paranoid, and vulnerable.  I truly do believe that we will all be ok.  And now more than ever, I have a lot to back up my theory of New York City being the best city in the world. \"\"They say they do this for their  God .  I don\'t care what religion you believe in, but if you believe in a God, He created us, why would we kill eachother in the name of God.\"\"Well, I couldn\'t believe what I was seeing on television the morning of September 11th.  I was crying, I got sick, I was scared.  Ever since then, I\'ve been pretty much just as scared.  Things are getting better, but I feel like at anytime, anything can happen.  I\'m more aware of the people that are around me.  I haven\'t been eating lately either.  I know that really doesn\'t seem like it has to do with the attacks, but I was totally disgusted by the events and torn, that I made myself sick.  I\'m still scared.  Not as bad as before.\"I don\'t fly as much and I keep up with world news all the time.\"The Isrealis, because at the world trade center not one Jewish was there and why is that?  The paper says there were some Jewish people but their was not.\"Because they want help in Palestine and Lebanon and our government for years has ignored these people\"I feel that the event that happened was very bad and nothing I have ever seen or beent rough before.  While the media and the government are quick to throw the blame on someone or some group, I feel that really they have no clue really who is behind this.  Our government has to say something otherwise the people of this great nation will start to ask questions.  The people that committed these crimes have no heart and ddo not care about themselves or other life.  This war that we are in now because of this event is not really just.  Yes we should retaliate to who did this,  but I feel like our government really is scared of the middle east.  They really do not want anyone to rise over their.  If their is a islamic nation formed then it would be very powerful and the United States would have trouble with their oil and trading.  It is all about politics and who can control what.  I feel we should worry about our own first.  Every country whether it be the U.S. or the middle east has the right to have their own government.  You do not see the U.S helping the palestinians or the lebanese people because we have no oil interests their.  We only help those which we can benefit from and this is a shame.  \"',3,-5,0,2,5,1.18,1.18,0,0.59,0,0,0,0,0.59,0,5.32,0,5.02,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.07,0.59,0,0.3,3.84,1.77,0,0.59,7.68,0,0,0,1.48,1.18,0.59,2.07,0,33.98,0.89,0.89,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,44.03,2.36,0,5.02,0,0.59,0,0.89,0,1.77,0,0,0.59,0,0,10.94,10.05,4.14,0,0,0,4.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,0,0,0.59,Female

It was almost unreal, I had just been in that area the previous week! We live only 50 mins. away from NYC and have many friends working there. I then started getting guilty feelings for having left a customer a message to call me back, (just right after the first plane had hit), thinking the husband could be working there.... Then all the thoughts about the people we knew that might have been there. I am a bit less scared now that some time has passed. My first thoughts were of: all the lives that were lost and who had been affected, possible war, young men being drafted, more attacks, what types of attacks, recession,transportation into NY....  I had to attend classes in NY the Saturday right after the attacks. I questioned whether I really wanted to do this, or put attending the classes off, by another year (this has been by choice, since I already have a degree). After much soul-searching, I decided to go in. I travelled by train (thinking something might happen to the train system) and ended up having to go to an alternate location, since the classes originally had been held only 2 bldgs. away from the WTC.  I am glad that I did go in. I still think of all the possibilities of what can go wrong; but I really don\'t want this to stop me from doing what I have wanted to do for several years now. I have to travel further and have inconviniences; but after all that has happened, my inconviniences are truly very minor. The WTC disaster will affect us all. Even though we did not lose a family member, we did lose many from or community and surrounding communities.Many have lost jobs. We will all have to adapt and help each other get through this. Good luck with your survey. VVL \"\"Here\'s the deal.  If someone really wanted to create a major loss of life in this country, they could have done more than crashed airplanes into buildings.  If what they really wanted to do was annihilate as many Americans as possible, they could have filled those planes with Anthrax or some other chemical weapon.  Since this was not the case, it seems like the motive was something else...the World Trade Centers are a symbol of America\'s financial prosperity.  I think they were lashing out at exactly this...our financial proposperity.\"My behaviors...not really at all.  My thoughts...tremendously.\"More than likely, Osama Bin Ladin, but this is based on news coverage of the event.\"\"The whole thing seems unreal.  I almost feel like I need to go to New York to confirm that the events in our country actually transpired last week.  I was not personally affected...by that I mean that none of my friends/family/acquaintances were harmed.  However, I do believe that you did not need to be  personally  affected to feel the effects.   In addition to the terrible loss of life, it is so tragic that those beautiful buildings are gone. I don\'t feel, however, that we should necessary go in and bomb Afghanistan.  There are horrible people in that country, but there are also good people there.  The Taliban is an oppressive force, which in addition to many of its other ills, terribly abuses women.  Women have no voice or rights in that country.  They are senseless victims, too, and the United States would be no better than terrorists if we were to let loose weapons of mass destruction, harming innocent people.\"\"They haven\'t, really.  Not the day to day behaviors.  I still study, hang out with my friends, go to class. I watch the news more regularly.  There\'s a flag in the window.  I guess I don\'t take people for granted any longer.\"\"A highly organized, extensive terrorist group that is more than likely affiliated with Osama bin Laden.\"\"Hatred.  They hate America, or what it represents.  Maybe they wanted to prove a point.  What that point is, I have no idea.  Maybe just that they could do it.  To show us that we\'re not really safe.  Only they know why they did it.  They may be the only ones who will ever know.\"\"Horror, shock, fear.  All of those feelings ran through me as I watched everything unfold on television.  My class lat out early that day, so I was watching the news by the time the first Tower fell.  I was on the phone with my mother as I watched, and all I could think to say was \'oh my God.\'  I couldn\'t believe what I was seeing.  One moment it was there... Smoking, but there.  The next, it was crashing down, the dust and debris so thick.  I hope I never see anything like it ever again.  I felt like I was watching some sort of disaster movie, but I knew I wasn\'t.  It was real, and I have to say that I will never look at a history book the same way ever again.  We read about Pearl Harbor, the JFK assassination, and we ask our grandparents or our parents where they were when it happened.  And now, somewhere down the line, I may have children that ask me where I was when the United States was attacked by terrorists.  And I will know where I was.  I will never forget.  I don\'t think anyone will.  Whatever innocence we had left seems to be gone.\"I am more sad and depressed about the possible consequences of power out of control in the US\"To get our attention, to knock our blinders off, to punish us, to give us an idea of how they feel \"\"It is unclear. We clearly had something to do with it with our arrogant mid east policy, and our continuing support of dictators and groups against humanity throughout the world as long as it suits our purpose, which appears transparent to many people in the world but not to us... \"\"I worry that it has repowered the very things that were losing power, e.g. the Bush presidency, I am deeply concerned that it has put aside the conversation re reparation of slavery for African Americans, I worry that it has put aside concern for personal freedom, that it has put aside conversations on multi-nationals and their calamitous affect on the entire world for the benefit of a few and that those who continue to raise thiese concerns will be labeled terrorists that by asking for informaiton on terrorists at all levels of government that we are starting another McCarthyite attack on the government and the people.... and I am most concerned that the conversations since the attack have focused on war on a poor nation and on people that can\'t defend themselves, that we once supported, and that we have not a clue re our image in the rest of the world and why people might hate us enough to make a commitment to carry out this attack, and because we refuse to face it, we can do nothing that will truly end the cycle of violence.  This is an intelligent and constantly changing and adapting, fully committed \'enemy\'. I am concerned that because this was a very well organized attack that reprisal on our part, rather than learning about and fixing the attitudes and behavior that have helped bring this about, will continue a cycle of violence where the US will continue to put its own citizens and its protection of individual liberties in danger. The only way out (through) is to learn the other\'s truth and concerns, to stop arguing with the facts just because we disagree with them, and to then and only then to take apporpriate action, which wil be much different than the action we appear ready to take at this time.  \"Less trust in this country and the President.This event resembled a Bruce Wills movie. So unreal and the aftermath just seems like the movie ending. My biggest question is why with all the intellence agencies and their  spies  that we have in the US and abroad - why wasn\'t someone aware of this event. I don\'t believe that they weren\'t. I think the CIA is bored and lokking for action.For some reason that I fail to comprehend.CIARetaliation.It could be anyone.I pray a lot more.\"I was truly shocked and appalled that this type of disregard for  human life is harbored in some individuals.  It just confirmed for me  that you cannot protect yourself from people who have deranged  thinking.    There is also a part of me that thinks that America must have done  something terrible to the nation(s) responsible for this tragedy.  I have a gut feeling that the tragedy was a retaliation for something we have  done to them.  We really don\'t know what America is doing in these other  countries.  We don\'t know what kind of tragedies we have caused them. We are at the mercy of what the media wants us to know. This tragedy also put me in the mind of the incident when a plane in China was shot down by American troops  accidentally  and there were issues surrounding an apology from America.  As I can recall, there was big debate on whether America should apologize or not, and that was  the only thing the victim\'s family wanted.  America (or maybe I should say the President?) had a hard time saying sorry it was a mistake. We, meaning America, have to realize that other countries suffer from  their tragedies, just as we do.   I don\'t believe that going to was is the answer.  I have no ideas of what the answer would be, but I do believe that we have to do something.   Going to war is not it.  Teaching our children and our children\'s children the value of life and the love of God can be a beginning.  Prayer needs to be put back into the schools.  Prayer needs to be taught to be a  part of everyone\'s everyday life.   I pray that our leader\'s seek direction from God in what to do.  In  reading the Old Testament, there are many stories related of war and  fighting and in the scriptures, God makes it very clear on what one  should do when faced with adverse situations:   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all things (including wisdom and discernment-my emphasis) will be added unto you.   Matthew 6:33\"\"I can\'t understand why someone would do this, expect that they must be very evil and hate the USA very much.\"\"No single person, but a very large group of terrorists throughout the world\"\"I notice things now that I took forgranted before. For example, planes flying overhead used to be something I hardly paid any attention to, because it was such a normal thing.  Now I look up and wonder if the people in that plane are safe.   \"\"The morning that it happened, I was talking on Instant Messenger with a friend at about 9 am and he suddenly told me to go to an internet news site.  The headlines were something like  Plane crashes into WTC  and I thought that this was a horrible, horrible accident.  I figured that some small little plane had an instrument failure of some sort and lost control.  I knew this was a tragedy, but my mind never thought that it could be anything *but* an accident.  Then I read that *two* planes had hit, and a was convinced that this was a typo or an error in reporting, because two planes couldn\'t accidently hit the WTC towers.  It suddenly donned on me, however, that maybe this wasn\'t an accident.  Then the news started making conflicting reports about explosions at the white house and the capital building and the pentagon and suddenly it was as if world war III had started. At this point I was absolutely shocked.  But the whole time I was just assuming that the planes that had crashed were small privite plans bought by suicidal terrorists.  I had class that morning, so I went, and it wasn\'t until I walked out of class and saw a friend who told me that the planes were commercial planes hijacked with innocent people onboard.  I\'m was stunned.  The thought that people could be so crazy and evil to do such a thing was just flabbergasting. And only then did I really begin to understand that this was going to be such a huge tragedy. When I went back to my dormroom, my suite mates were watching tv (we actually just got cable installed right before I had to leave for class) and the first thing they said when I walked in was that the WTC towers had *fallen down*. I litterly burst out into tears, because any hope that people had to get out of those buildings safely was gone.  I was so sad thinking about how many people had died, and how many families were going to lose loved ones.  I didn\'t know anyone who worked in New York, or at the Trade Center, fortunately, so I was not directly effected, but I called my mother just to make sure that all of my family was okay, as I come from the Boston area and actually siblings living in California, so the flight from Logan to LA is well known to my family.  Only a week before this happened I actually flew from LA to Logan, coming back from my summer job, and it was really freaky to think that someone could just walk onto a plane with knives and kill thousands of people. It made me wonder how safe I really was when I flew this summer.  It made me angry to think that these terrorists could have enought power to take over 4 planes.  The images on the TV are horrific, all those innocent people died for no good reason at all.  And those people who jumped out of the building from enormous heights.  Given the choice of burning to death or jumping, I don\'t know what I would choose, I don\'t want to think about what I was choose, I just hope to god I never have to choose something so horrible. The first time I saw the film of the planes hitting the towers, it didn\'t have very much of an emotional effect, because it just looked like a scene out of a movie, just some kind of special effect.  I\'ve talked to people that have said that as they watched the images over and over they became numb, they  got used  to the image, were desensitized to it.  For me, it was exactly the opposite.  Those images have actually gotten harder and harder for me to watch.  The idea that there were actually real people in those planes and in the tower became more and more real as the news reporters began to interview people who were desperatly trying to find loved ones and the reports of people on the planes and people trapped in the building calling loved-ones on cell phones started coming out.  So mostly I\'ve felt sadness and fear during these last few days. But have also felt hope and pride in my country, a pride I\'ve never before really experienced.  Seeing people pulling together, helping each other, and not allowing the terrorists to destroy our way of life is encouraging.  I feel this pride every time I see an American Flag, now, which is all the time since they seem to be desplayed everywhere now.  I\'m apprehensive about what\'s going to happen in the future, thought.  There are many conflicting feelings that I have when it comes to America\'s response to this act of terrorism. I don\'t want America to go to war, but I also want to see America take steps to eradicate terrorism so that I can truely feel safe again.   \"Bin Laden\"I was horrified by the destruction, deaths, and brutality shown by the attackers. For one, I can\'t imagine hating a country enough that you would committ suicide over it. My heart goes out to everyone who has died, and for the families suffering from lost ones. My heart also goes out to everyone in NYC who is dealing with the aftermath. I am worried that the economy is going to be even worse now, particularly the job market, and that numerous businesses all over the country will go bankrupt. The airline industry has obviously been hit very hard, which will have a huge impact for all personal and business travel. The only good news is that people seem to be coming together to help, and it has seemed to cause a new appreciation for friends and family.  I was laid off in February, so the job situation is my biggest personal concern. I have been interviewing since mid April, but have not received an offer yet. Companies are postponing hiring until 2002, or have no Senior openings, or are hesitant to hire. I pray this tragic event does not have a ripple affect in this sector.\"\"Calling my sister more who was very upset, greater sense of compassion\"\"Anger, ignorance, psychiotic misnomer that they are  god  and will rule the world\"I don\'t think my behaviors have changed.\"I was, needless to say, shocked when I heard the news.  My professor reported the news to us when class began, and I thought he was joking.  The news didn\'t register until I went back home and turned on the news.  No matter how many times I see the collapse of the twin towers, it is still horrifying and almost unbelievable.  It looks like scenes from a movie.  Hearing and reading about personal accounts of the victims bring tears to my eyes.  There are so many separate stories, so many people affected... I am resuming my daily life as normal as before the attack, but in the back of my mind, I am afraid that there will be a second wave of terrorism someday.    \"\"To get their message across.  Feels American liberties, freedom, and rights are wrong.\"terrorists- maybe affiliated with Osama Bin LadenPresident George W. Bush\"The events of September 11th were tragic, disturbing, and very sad. This terrorist attack is numbered among the senseless deaths of Pearl Harbor, Oklahoma City bombings, and even Columbine shootings. But are these really senseless? Personally, I am interested in learning about the motivations of the  criminals  in these events. Perhaps this is simply an indication that the US needs more than a  reality check , but in essence a real  change . It really disturbs me to hear about civilian deaths of Arab-American citizens by other - no doubt, white - citizens because of their heritage and culture. How has this hate penetrated our individual lives and public perspective? Or is it simply a mirror of the subtle lives we live everyday? Moreover, you can feel it in the air that people are praying for bin Laden to be found, for Bush to bomb Afghanistan...I believe that most Americans are more interested in revenge than reflection and change. What have all these 5000+ deaths taught us as a country? I really don\'t know. \"I think I\'m more at peace with myself. I try to be more spiritual and understand what death really means.\"Well, the terrorists did it as an act of war.

'I feel like I covered that in my first statement.  I have increased my international news sources.\"I think that this has been a long time in the making and is a result of the United States not  playing nice  with the rest of the world.  Our arrogance has brought us here.  I do believe that the people who did this should be tried in a criminal court for crimes against humanity. Any action we take should include the advice and support of other countries, so we don\'t make the same mistakes again.  I find the  cowboy speach  that George Bush is using lately to be very shortsided and embarrassing.  I think we should embrace the international community and become a bit humble.   I have to say that my international stance doesn\'t include a continuation with our mercenary practices.  I do believe that we can\'t concern ourselves with every conflict in the world that is politically or economically of interest to the USA.  A result of this would again be relying on the international community as a whole to make those decisions - it can\'t be both ways.  If we are going to come off our high horse and respect the international community and play by mutually agreed terms, then we as a country should not be expected to come to the aid of people in troubled areas - we would help only as an international coalition.\"To instigate us to action against the middle east and spark a war that will result in increased furvor in anti-americanism.\"More grateful for the gifts that I have been given (family, freedom).  More patriotic.  Have not changed overt behaviors much - flying next week.\"\"As a proud American, I feel very torn between my desire for peace and my desire for justice.  I have attempted to learn more about the situational variables that contributed to the attack (the involvement of the US in the Middle East), and attempted to reconcile my thoughts as a social psychologist (that aggression breeds aggression) with my deep feelings of anger, sympathy, and outrage as an American.  Although I believe that Bush has carefully considered alternative plans of action, and I definitely support the initial phases of military intervention, I am unsure about my support of a prolonged attack of a faceless enemy.\"Out of a sense of being violated by another country.  Hatred of a country/system that intervenes in other parts of the world.Hmmmmmmmmm.  Trying not to guess where you are going with this.  Osama Bin Laden and the terrorist cells that support his efforts.Probably some extremist groups associated with bin laden... I am considering not flying on airplanes for a while. I am spending more time with my friends and on the phone with loved ones. \"My primary reaction to the events is that of helplessness and fear. I knew that people in other countries lived in constant fear of attacks to their people, but I had always beleived that America was different-that we were safe. That feeling of sheltered safety was ripped away on Tuesday.       After feeling helpless, I began to feel worried about my family. After I confirmed that my family and friends were ok, I began to feel very very very sad about the people who died. I cried several times on Tuesday and Wednesday.      After this period, I began to hear of anti-Arab-American and anti-Muslim attacks. This made me very sad, but instead of feeling helpless, I was able to understand that I could help with this discrimination. I helped by talking to anyone I could to raise awareness about this, and by always smiling and saying  hello, how are you  to people of arab/muslim descent (or those who looked foreign and darker) that I saw on the street so that they feel safer and know that at least some white-americans care about their well-being. \"\"i think that these groups are reacting to the U.S.\'s alliance with Israel and the fact that the U.S. supplied weapons to Israel which are used to attack muslims in palestine. And also, that at the recent conference on racism held in africa (I beleive) the U.S. refused to label Israel\'s actions as  racist . I understand the motives of the terrorists, but I disagree with their means for acheiving their goals. Terrorism is unacceptable- goals must be pursued by peaceful means.  \"Keep an eye out for left bags at the train station etc.Muslim radicals\"It was like watching a scary movie that suddenly became reality. It seemed unreal and at the same time the sorrow of all those people who has lost a loved one is very real and that made me very sad. It felt like  this is it . Maybe the 3th world war is starting now. When things settle down a little bit, my thoughts went to the long term perspectives. Will this mean futher unstability and war? Will this turn into a world religios war? Will this make the gap between the rich and the poor world bigger? I hope everybody in leadership will be very wise and make decisions that will make the world a fairer and better place, not more war. And at the same time I understand the feeling of  we have to defend ourselves. We have worked hard to make  our  world a good and rich place. We want to keep it that way. I know several policemen and other people in NYC, and I know people who is in the US military. My thoughts go to them to. And to the firemen who has lost so many of their friends and collegues.  \"Feeling that noone is listening to them. No other means of making people listen.In retaliation for perceived wrongs by this country and to mobilize power for Bin Laden.

Directly, the terrorists probably funded by and masterminded by Bin Laden.  Indirectly, perhaps we and our cocky attitudes are.\"I cry more and more easily.  I am thankful that I was not directly effected but I don\'t think my behavior has changed.\"Shock, fear, and profound sadness not only for those whose lives were shattered, but for all of us and for the country.  We have squandered our involvement in our government -- only about half the eligible population votes and we have taken our form of government along with our rule by law for granted.  As a result, we have an administration that does not represent the majority of the country.  I have a deep mistrust of the president and do not see him as capable of making the decisions that will move us forward.  This could be an opportunity to rethink how we have typically responded to violence with more violence.  Yet, I fear that we will squander that opportunity as we have abdicated our involvement in our election process.  In that regard, I suppose we deserve what we got.   Perhaps, just maybe there will be enough of us who are tired of boys with war toys making the decisions and we can find a better solution.  There has to be a better way out of this than more of the same.  Hasn\'t there been enough killing?  Maybe we need to look at the underbelly of our own society to see where the truth lies and why people resent us and are willing to die themselves to terrorize us. Surely we can collectively find a solution, but not if we leave it up to the boys in Washington.  It is time for measured wisdom, not random killing.\"I have a new perspective on events in my own life.  Less taking things for granted and more appreciation of how good my life really is.  Less willing to stand by and let people treat each other with disrespect.  Spend much more time contemplating.\"Not sure.

It was horrific, terrible, unbelievable, sad, beyond anything I had ever imagined...  Sometimes I don\'t think it has really sunk in.  It was like watching a horrible movie or having a nightmare...maybe it didn\'t really happen.  I feel so much pain for the people who lost loved ones and I am really tired of crying.\"\"To make a statement, because they hate the US, because they could and because they have way to much free time on their hands.\"\"This was a brilliant tactical move for a group who intended to create fear and confusion among the US people and government. I assume that this was a major factor motivating this group. I also believe that there must have been a strong desire to avenge perceived wrongs by inflicting harm on  the enemy,  at any cost.\"\"I believe that this was an act of terrorism carried about by an organized political faction. It is not yet clear who was in control of this group and how independent they were from other, large scale organizations. While it is possible that this is the work of a group with ties to Bin Laden, these connections have not yet been proven and caution must be exercised in assuming he is responsible.\"\"My sense of shock and horror at the immediate events was followed fairly closely by a terrible fear of what the consequences would be. I continue to feel saddened by the tragedy of the individual deaths, the loss and confusion for family members and friends of the victims, and the nightmarish images of people hanging out the windows of the building waiting for help that did not come.  I am concerned that this tragedy will only lead to more suffering, violence and evil, as a frightened population vents its frustration on other innocent victims, at both the local and international level. I feel that the mistrust, suspicion, and hatred that has been let loose in our communities will be hard to control and may result in long-standing conflict, prejudice, and alienation.\"I don\'t think my behavior has changed in any noticeable way.Bin Laden and his followers\"I have a new found appreciation for what I have in life since that date most of all.  In addition, I feel more patriotic and more proud to live where i do.\"Jelously and power\"I believe that what happened was truly a tragic occurance and someone needs to be repremenanded for what they did to our country, But I also believe that all things happened for a reason, and since this tragic event, so many good things have occured in this nation.  Things such as patriotism, unity, and even a appreciation for what we do have in the United States have become important to almost all US citizens since this date.  It makes me feel better about what happened to know that something good did actually come out of something so bad. \"They are jealous of the United States.none I was very stunned and saddened by the events that took place on September 11th.

As a child I used to dream about atom bombs exploding (a large mushroom on the horizon) and flooding (I live in the Netherlands). Last night I dreamt that terrorists blew up a large cruise ship: the top part collapsed onto the lower part where the explosives had been placed. I felt as appalled and shocked as when I saw the second plane go into the WTC. Last week in a dream I saw that shocking scene very clearly played out: the two shining towers, a plane lining itself up and crashing into it. The only difference: it was not a modern passenger plane, but an old fashioned plane, of the kind you see in movies with Humphrey Bogart.

It is difficult to discuss the anthrax problems and the hatred towards the United States with my students, yet a sense of trust has really bonded me to most of the kids. They realize I will tell them when to worry.

I do not trust the Taliban at all. I am a woman, and a damn smart one. I would castrate any man who tried to make me hide under an oat sack.

I felt that very personally. To have our country attacked so brutally, using our own domestic planes as  vehicles of mass destruction, in such a  showy  way was almost more than I could bear. At first,the huge human lose and suffering was so shocking and sad, I would cry everytime those that were missing loved ones would come on tv with a picture and description of the missing....so determined and sure they would be found.  This still brings me to tears recalling it. Seeing the events over and over on tv I felt as if the perpetrators had reduced us to the level of a violent video game (planes crashing into prominent buildings which were reduced to rubble). This was hurtful and demeaning as well as horrific. I also felt violated because this happened on our own soil. Now, I have an underlying feeling of fear about the future on many levels.  Living in Saudi Arabia, we have such a sense of uncertainty right now.  Our offices were blown up in \'95 by 4 young Saudis who had spent lots of time in Afganistan with the then freedom fighters. How many other like them are here now?  What will be the repucussions in the region, if US military strikes begin? That could go so many ways. My fears for home, in American, are that the terrorism will continue and escalate over a long period of time and take on many forms.  It is so difficult to say how all of this will go now.  However, I continue to place my trust in God, the only answer to getting through all of this mess. I pray that our leaders stay focused on that, too.   On a positive note, I am so proud and amazed at what a unifying effect this has had on our nation....and so immediately. It has been astounding.  My hope is that this will be sustained.  We have come to be a people of  instant gratification  and I hope America doesn\'t just get bored with this like yesterday\'s news.  This is not going away quickly.  Note to Jamie: thanks for the opportunity to write about this.  I just sat down and started writing...had no idea I\'d have so much to say. William may get a chance to respond, as well, on the weekend.      \"\"The attacks on our nation, the nation that I have forever been told that I am safe in, has taken me by shock.  Not just in the literal sense, but in every possible physical sense of the word.  I have many friends and realtives who work in or around the WTC and I have never spent a day glued to the TV/phone/computer trying to get in touch with so many people just to make sure tha they are OK.  This was something new to me and everyday I pray that they are surviving and trying to continue on with their lives.  The event changed my life forever, I now talk to more than 20 people a day, long distance just to tell them that I love them and I am thinking about them, and I make an effort to recognize how such a little action from me may change someone\'s feelings for the rest of the day.  I smile more, thank people more, and I tell myself that I must make the best of this day because we never know.  BUT, I DO NOT live in fear for I will not allow these terrorists to get their wish.\"\"Because fanatics see only their thoughts and beliefs and will not accept that there are others who do not agree with them and therefore must go about doing acts of hatred to try and prove to themselves that they are superior,....how ironic\"I can only go by what I have been told:  Terrorists groups led by Osama bin Laden0\"I fear the knee-jerk reaction of so many here, including our President, who say we should go fight, get even, or prove that  they can\'t get away with it.   The US is a very powerful nation.  If we substitute the image of the US as that of a big, strong, and influential person, one with powerful weapons and deeply held convictions, that person would be scary to almost everyone else, no matter how benevolent the person was.     The US needs to carefully evaluate the affect of its actions and attitudes on the economies, the governments, and the people of other nations. We may not be completely innocent, we may not be the benevolent force for only good that we would like to be.  We may sometimes take the side of another nation even when they are not being just to others.  We take resources from other nations to support our extravagent lifestyles, and we encourage other nations to allow our capitalistic endeavors to invade their lands.  We allow our businesses to introduce cigarettes and other unhealthy goods. And we build up our borders to keep people out.  Much of our rescource use is unsustainable, and our practices are not sound or healthy for those nations and peoples.    This is not to excuse the terrorists or the act.  Certainly whomever is responsible must be prevented from doing anything more, and other terrorists must be prevented from targeting us or any other nation or group.  I fear their use of chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons. This is not the way to solve conflicts, whether they are political, social, religious, or ideological. But as the most powerful nation, the US has a special responsiblity to make sure that our actions do not either unintentionally or carelessly harm others.  Escalating the violence, especially without careful consideration, and an evaluaton of our own culpability, is also not the way to solve conflicts.    I do see some good coming from this. People are banding together more and seeking internal harmony.  At least our internal racial, political, ideological, and some religious and cultural differences seem to be becoming less of an obstacle to finding solutions.\"\"Directly, probably Osama bin Laden; indirectly, many people and organizations, perhaps even to a certain extent, ourselves.\"\"I feel more pride in the US and its people, and more fear of unknown people of middle-eastern cultures.  I fear the end to our society\'s (and my own) carefree, consumerist lifestyle and freedom.  I fear a long, painful war. \"\"Combination of any of fear, resentment, envy, fanaticism, sense of helplessness.\"I am not completely sure--though probably Bin Laden and his associates.\"Anger, fear, sick retaliation.\"This has been a horrible event.  I feel very sad for all of the people involved--especially those that lost people or loved ones.  I simply cannot imagine how these people must be feeling as I didn\'t personally lose anyone.  I do wish there were something I could do to help the people who are suffering the most.I am watching the news and listening to NPR constantly.\"My perspective on Sep 11th has been in retrospect threefold: I had been watching TV news and saw the twin towers attack as it happened through the media. First, the absolute horror that the unthinkable had happened, that  a deliberate and major attack on a centre of the civilized and apparently invulnerable/peacable part of the world had taken place and the accompanying horrors of people still alive knowing they had nil chance of escaping the building or plane.   Then secondly, in the wake of this came a dawning awareness that people who did this must feel very strongly indeed about their ideals and that maybe we in the affluent West need to reassess what is going on in a REAL sense in other less fortunate areas of the world.  It is a very difficult thing to try and empathise with people who live in another different culture and situation but perhaps this is the silver lining on the black cloud of the Sep 11 event. Thirdly, and further down the time track, I realised that in the greater scheme of things this was not such an outstanding event - that in terms of human life many more people died over the centuries from wars, famine or disease.  The shock of this Sep 11 must come mainly, thus, from the dissonance between the symbols of technology and human advancement and the ease with which it can be destroyed.  The horrors of Sep 11 will fade, as did those of WW1 trench warfare, as did all those other horrific events in world history. Philosophically we have to come to realise that things like this will always happen, society will always be vulnerable to extreme idealists unless it becomes completely over controlled, and so we must live with this.  What we should take home is the second reaction above:  that we need to share the world\'s resources more fairly.  The flame of fanatical religious idealism is basically fanned by inequity, cruel ignorance by the world\'s wealthy ( especially the deliberate ignoring by those who are very well off and think they are so entitled) and come to some realisation that for our own sakes as well as others we must work actively towards a fairer, more reasonable world.\"A mistaken belief in the righteousness of their action\"More wary when flying on planes, more aware of people who fall into the category of potential terrorists but not in any way acting on such awareness Less complacent about the way people in the West live \"Religious fanaticsBecause they have been brainwashed to hate AmericansTaliban (Ben Lauden)\"I have become more religious, more patriotic, and wanting to become more giving to those in need\"\"September 11th marks a great day of sadness in America.  Not only did it affect those families who lost their loved ones, but it also affected almost all Americans.  We are so thankful to be alive and yet scared at what might happen next.  Some of us are denying the fact that anything is going to happen and others of us are praying to God each night to protect us from harm\'s way.  I can\'t begin to describe the deep sorrow I feel when I hear the family stories about their loved ones or about the brave people who stormed the cockpit and said before they defende their plane and country  lets role!   I hope that we as Americans as well as the world can stand against terroisim and can hopefully one day work out all our differences.\"\"It\'s hard to say, I want to fly and still live the way I used to, but this hits very close to home. The thought of this occuring so close to my backyard makes me wary to visit public buildings, so I think I will stay away from high profile targets for a while. \"\"I am deeply shocked, I watched it on tv like millions of others and am incensed that this could happen in the most powerful Country in the world. I know that America is such a high profile target, however I was under the mistaken impression that we had the ability to protect ourselves. What good is having the best military and law enforcement in the world when we do not utilize it\'s effectivness? Now I am mad, everyday when our government does nothing increases my anger, I know we are going to act but yesterday is not soon enough. Our government parades itself into everyone\'s business, not just the people of this Country, by constantly telling other Countries how to run more effeceintly, while it doesn\'t exercise it\'s own teachings. We use words like caution and restraint yet do not show the same prudence in situations like Waco, why do we employ them now. I don\'t want Osama bin Laden to give himself up, these sneak attacks on civilian personnel will not stop. What purpose would a trial serve? Phrases such as  two wrongs don\'t make a right  don\'t apply here, this is not a shoving match on the playground, and I for one am not concerned if they consider retaliation war. I was in the military and will go again if needed, this is why we spent so many hours training. When I leave my house and see American flags everywhere I know many people feel the way I do, the time to act or react is now. \"\"He who supports terrorism and has vowed to kill all Americans, Osama bin Laden.\"\"His mistaken religious beliefs, his disregard for human life, or his personal vow to kill women and children, perhaps all three. \"\"I was shocked and saddened by the event.  I felt tremendous sadness about the loss of life.  I also felt angry the tensions between our nations have culminated to such catastrophic proportions, as I believe dipolmatic interventions and alliance building by the US could have prevented such a tragedy.  In other words, if we were more ammenable to relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and even European nations, a united effort could have prevented Bin Ladden\'s rise in power and esteem by disaffected Muslims.\"\"Bin Ladden, but I also think that he was able to come to power because so many are angered by US foriegn policy.  Still it is a heinous deplorable act, and he is responsible.\"\"A fascistic vision of a utopia, ability to villify and dehumanize US citizens, vengence, narcissism, power\"\"I spend more time thinking about the relationships, freedoms and and privileges I often take for granted.  i am more circumspect about the future.I am often numb or very sad.\"00I think it is terrible but fear what is going to happen next0',4,-5,0,2,5,0,3.53,0,0,0,0,0,2.12,0.71,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,0.71,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,3.89,1.41,0,0.71,3.17,0.71,0,0,6.35,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,1.06,0,37.77,0,4.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.85,4.23,0,3.17,0,0.71,0,0,0,1.42,0,0.71,0,0.71,0,10.6,13.08,4.23,0.71,0,1.41,4.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,1.06,Female
'00It was horrifying and I hate who did it. They were all innocent people. I do not think real Muslims can do such a thing. Who did these horrible attacks must be found and punished. USA HERSELFAl Qua\'daOut of lifelong frustration that has turned into hate. \"I have been restless since. I am a western woman originally from Holland, with western values. I feel on one hand my values are being threatened by fundamentalists who want me to sit at home and wear a veil. This is because since I was 15, I have noticed muslim men treat me differently than western men. In Holland they bothered me and my friends often and that has only gotten worse. In certain parts of town I was afraid to wear a short skirt because of them. So they have been taking some part of my freedom for some time already. What will happen now? I worry for my daughter who is 2.5 years old now. Will she know enough freedom? Holland is full of moslims now. The imams in Holland are saying they think homosexuals should get the death penalty. I have homosexual friends and family. I am also afraid for the war, the anthrax. Will it spread all over the world? Is the world still safe for my children? I can not say these things to my husband, he thinks I am exaggerating. I do have some (female) friends who share my fears. I also have a muslim female friend. I respect her religion and I know she is very afraid herself, and she condemns the attacks. But I also see how her husband treats her, what life for a muslim woman is like. It is hard and she admits it. These events have made me think more negatively about the Islam. Even if Muslims condemn the attacks, they do want the United States to sit back and do nothing about it just because the country hosting the terrorists is Muslim. That does not seem right to me.\"I follow the news a lot more. I look at my mail twice before I open it. I tend to watch planes as they fly over. When my husband is flying I check on the internet how his flight is progressing.\"American foreign policy has been bad for Afganistan, and they want to make as much of a mess in the US as there is in their home, so we know the consequences of US policies.\"\"I have been interested in the propoganda that is surrounding the planned retalitory attacks.  It seems to me that the US needs to strike back against the terrorist organizations responsible and perhaps against terrorist organizations in general, in order to maintain their quality of life.  At present, people don\'t feel safe on planes or at large gatherings, for example, and steps need to be taken to make everyday life safer.  Therefore the government is planning military and political actions to retaliate. To gain popular support for these retalitory actions, the government and media are spreading a lot of propoganda about the terrorist organization(s) that are believed responsible.  This information is at best incomplete, and is often inaccurate.  For example, I understand that Bin Ladin (sp?) is claimed to be a millionaire, but that in fact his fiances were shut down about 6 months ago, so that he doesn\'t have much money at all right now, and his organization is working on a shoe-string budget.  As well, few people seems to be wondering why that organization is angry with the US in particular, or to question current and previous foreign policy that has lead to this. What interests me about the propoganda is that it seems to be quite effective, but also seems to be almost entirely irrelevant.  The war cry seems to be  God bless America , which - at least on the surface - says nothing about who is the enemy or why.   God bless America  appears to be a battle cry that suggests we should bomb someone.  This is - to me - and odd and irrelevant battle cry.  The success of the propoganda seems to be unrelated to its reasonableness. On another note, the events of Sept 11 were horrible.  I\'m disappointed that no one seems to take this as a suggestion that the US re-examine it\'s foreign policy.\"Bin Ladin (sp?) and his organizationI have avoided travelling at certain times of the day when there is extra traffic congestion because of extra security checks.only that I talk about it more.  not really.\"if I had to say, I\'d say Teleban, but I am no expert and I only think that cos what I\'ve been told from the experts (via the media admittedly!)\"\"I wonder- that is my biggest question to myself! I can only think of it being due to immense anger to capitalism. and may be US has supported the wrong people in the past. I can undersand their anger, but I really dont understand how any anger can lead to doing what they (whoever that is!) did. \"\"My first reaction was horror- how can anyone even think of doing that kind of thing- and killing themselves. its kind of unreal, and I have to make myself think that anyone (people) could do that to so many people. I also think about how the individuals in the plane and in the towers must have felt- knowing they were going to die. But I cant really imagine it at all. the thought that you know you are going to die is just horrific and it was all done intentionally. I guess my main reaction (as I just cant imagine how I woudl have felt being in the towers) is to think of the people that set it all up and did it- how can humans behave like that? I try to think of any benefits we may get out of it (less than the loss I have no doubt, but there has to be something good in all of this- eventually). Capitalism is nasty, and may be we are not as innocent as we like to believe (although that is no justification for what happened). I dont like the city world and it\'d be nice if people actually discussed things like that now. US claimed it was an attack on democracy- I dont see that at all and I am sure they dont really- it was an attack on capitalism and I do think we can all feel guilty for the way we live when so many other people are suffering through lack of finances (food, shelter, freedom). we are so lucky and other people arent and we should remember that. I wish we woudl all think of it more rather than saying everyone else is wrong and we (capitalism) is right. the other main thing that goes through my mind is what will happen next- i.e. retaliation. I kind of deny to myself that anything coudl happen. Could bush really want more innocent (and really innocent this time) people to suffer. Afghanistanis have enough problems. our reaction shodul be to rescue them from their terrible world, not to attack all that they have left. \"I canceled an internation flight.  I watch the news more.\"To show the world that they can do it, first of all.  And secondly to show disapproval of U.S. ethnocentric global policies and actions.\"Osama bin Laden\"I am deeply saddened by the events of last week.  I feel sympathy for those who have lost loved ones in the tragedy.  I also feel uneasy about the amount of financial damage that has resulted -- layoffs, small businesses around the WTC that are being hurt, etc.  I\'m not afraid to fly, but did cancel a trip to Berlin next week that I will reschedule when the State Dept. makes international travel seem safe again.  I feel the need to seek some sort of action against the perpetrator, but I also think it is important to evaluate the U.S. and to understand what we did to make others so angry with us.  Finally, my last feeling is of patriotism.  For the first time in years, I really feel part of a greater U.S.\"0\"from what i understand so far i know it was an terrorist attack, but further than that, i cant conclude who the exact person is.\"to destroy the way we live\"That morning, i was driving to school, had the radio on and it was a special report they jsut said that an airplane had crashed in to the WorldTrade Center.  At first it didnt come to me, I thought it was a joke or somthing.  and then in class everyone starts talking aobut how they heard the same, and then another one into the Pentagon.  I come home and see on tv how it actually happened,i could not believe my eyes i didnt know what to say.  I felt this pain inside me and at the same time angry.  it just hurt seeing the many people running, i was scared thinking what was going to happen to our country.  Hearing how everyone afterwards was pitching in, helping others, our country uniting as one to get thourgh this devestaing incident, tears came to my eyes agian, I was proud to be an American.  This is my country and i love it, i love living here.  \"\"They are jealous, and they want something that they cannot get.\"\"I am more careful and I think before I speak to certain people.  Also, I fear my safety in places.  I do not take anything for granted either.\"I think the leader of the countries that the US has pissed off in the recent years.\"The tradgedy that occured on September 11th was too much for America to handle all at once. I felt sadness when I first got the news.  My heart went to all the families and loved ones.  I thought to myself, who would do something like this.  First I thought the people who did this were going to go straight to hell no questions asked.  But I realized after watching the news and then hearing everyones stories, that these terrorists that did this were the true definition of evil.  Why would and individual do this?  As an AMerican my first reaction was kill them all, and do not have any regrets.  I believe that is what we should do not take everyone down that was in this and make them suffer as much as the victims did.\"\"I really haven\'t changed in any ways, people might of thought I would of  maybe denied my faith, but I don\'t I grew stong to it. And the change I have seen in the United States of right now is that people are uniting, and are becoming more open and understanding to things that may be different then what they are usually seeing or believing!\"\" As of right now, people believe Osama Bin Laden did it, and he probably did, but who knows there are a lot of people behind these attacks and I think they are Insane, because I don\'t believe anyone in the right mind would do such trecturous acts, and even if they are sane, they  really don\'t believe in God, they probably are following the Devil. That\'s my opinion!\"\"The day of September 11th I trully was moritfied, with everything that was happening within the first couple of hours, after the two planes had crashed into the twin towers. There were so many things that rushed to my mind.  First of all I thought Oh great they are going to blame it on the Muslims, like they did for the Oklahoma Bombings.(Which me, myself is Muslim-American!) There was so much hate going around, which my friends and I couldn\'t help, but be scared for I knew some people would want to hurt us no matter if we were innocent or not.  At First when media and people started to blame Mulsims I was just hoping that it wasn\'t Muslims, because in our culture it is a major sin to kill others and commit suicide.  Our Lord would never ask of us to do a treturous act to others. I trully am sorry for all thoses who got hurt and died in this unspeakable act. And I really like to pay all my condolences to thoses who last loved ones, and not only that I wish there was more I(personally)could do. But for as of this moment I just hope and pray everyone is doing fine and will find in their hearts to move on and remember what the brave people did to stop and help of what has been done to the United States. As people are now saying more often, United We Stand, Seperated We Fall!\"\"People who are insane to do and terrorist attacks, myself I would not prefer to point fingers.

There is no rational reason why anyone would commit such an atrocity.  Ultimately, the terrorists got the world\'s attention and so in that particular way, they most likely accomplished one of their goals.  In some ways, Bin Ladin\'s ability to manipulate people into hate and giving themselves up for a cause seems dangerously analogous to Hitler...\"I appreciate the world in a different way.  I am not concerned for my personal safety but I worry if the world my future kids grow up in will be less  free  than what I have enjoyed. I hope that I will remain more sensitive to other people\'s needs...\"I am greatly troubled by last Tuesday\'s events.  At first I could not believe it... It was like watching a video on TV--it did not seem real, no matter how often I saw it.  The twin towers are the best symbol of New York and represent American commerce.   My boyfriend saw the 2nd plane hit the WTC from atop a building in Newark and saw the buildings crumble later on...  He is very deeply disturbed in a way that I have never seen in him before and only now is he beginning to talk about what he experienced with friends.  I truly hope that such an atrocity will never happen to anyone in the world ever again (though I recognize that is more hopeful than realistic.) I have always thought that Americans in the U.S. were safe from attack.  The calculated orchestration of the attack (and the fact that the terrorists had lived here for months/years truly worries me.)  I am also troubled by the prospect of entering into a war, but I agree that the U.S. needs to take a  stand  of some kind to enforce that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated.  However, I am heartened by the great show of support among all Americans during this time of crisis.    I hope that all Americans will come out of this better people as well as better citizens.  Life (and our freedoms) are a gift which we usually take for granted.  I hope that years from now, people will still remember these gifts and be kinder, and less self-absorbed.  We have some wonderful and valuable lessons to learn from this disaster--so long as we allow them to permeate our being (and not just to affect us for a few weeks as with most new year\'s resolutions).

A little while later I got a phone call from my older brother who lives in Florida.  He had been flying between Florida and California on business and was stuck in Houston.  He caught a bus to Austin and we spent several days together before he was able to get a flight home.  That really brought home the impact of the plane crashes. Wednesday I also found out that several co-workers were stranded in New York, Chicago and California where they had been travelling on business.

I also feel for the mother\'s that lost sons who were the terriorists!!  Their hearts must be breaking - how could their sons do this! It is so wonderful to see American\'s once again taking pride in their country!!!  We lost that pride somewhere during the conflice in Vietnam.  And it is so wonderful to see American\'s being neighbors again and really really caring for one another.  If anything good can come from a tragedy - this will be two of them. Being so far removed from NY it is hard to comprehend what has really happened.  It is sort of like watching the evening news and hearing about things like this in the Middle East.  If one could see it first hand, I am sure that this would have a greater impact on one\'s life.\"\"I\'m staying home more, shop only for necessities (a spending spree feels disrespectful, somehow).  \"They must be thoroughly poisoned by hate. \"I am still feeling numb--it still hasn\'t sunk in for me.  I understand logically the magnitude of the attack and its consequences, but my feelings haven\'t caught up yet.  Some of my friends talk about their sadness and fear.  I only feel that the events are real for an instant or two, then it slips away again.   My thoughts are ranging from wondering about what the future will be like--how will the economy change, how hard will it be to travel?  Will we lose our freedoms and civil rights?  Then I feel anger that we can hold our own lives so precious that we\'ll go to war or whatever when 10,000 of us die.  Yet 30,000 civilians died in Nicaragua, in terrorist/guerilla attacks by the CIA-funded contras, and we don\'t think anything about that.  I worry that the changes that we ourselves will make out of fear and revenge will make us worse than anything an enemy could do to us.\"Terrorists.

I have trouble sleeping\"Overwhelming saddness!  Not only for the loss in human life, but also for the loss of innocense for our youth. There also is fear, though this emotion has lost its intensity as time passes and life in my small world returns to normal.  There is also dread, as I know the killing will continue.  We will retaliate because it seems that violence is the universal language that everyone understands.  I don\'t mean to sound unpatriotic, I just wish there was some other way.  Surprisingly, what I\'m not feeling is anger! I expect that as the saddness lifts, however anger will replace that space.    \"I have become more aware of the islomic and mulsim cultre.Because the are hateful ugly people.I really don\'t know. Who really does?\" What really  gets to me is how any one that looks of arb decent are being single outed and sterotyped as being terrorist and hating america. Just because a few men,who were obviously sick in the head,took such and evil action, it doesn\'t mean that all arbs are like that. These men claimed religious belifs were the cause of  their actions but no religion of any kind would encourage the death of thousand of people. We should stop hating and realize who the true enemy is.\"\"When I first saw the news of what had happened, I was shocked, appalled, outraged. I had CNN on all afternoon, and some of the comments that some of the callers were making were just ridiculous. I understand that  we  were attacked, but that does not call for some of the comments that many of these people were saying. People were automatically assuming it was people from the Middle East. I think the thing that bothers me the most about the entire incident is that, although more than 3,000 people died, we have to remember all of the people who were saved and the people who saved them. I am a firm believer that killing a large group of people will not make right the deaths that occurred here. Another issue that I still think about is the kind of message that this incident must send out to other countries. We are supposed to be the super power of the World and look at us. I can\'t even imagine how many people must be laughing when they see the news and here of yet another person who managed to get past all of this new security that we have at the airports and everywhere. If a person has their mind set on doing something, they will find a way to do it, no matter what the obstacles are. Right now, I think our goal needs not to be to Osama Bin Laden, but to concentrate on the much larger issues that we have at home. I am going to be a teacher and it really frustrates me to see hear that the government cannot afford more than 2\% of its annual budget for education, but it can spend billions of dollars hunting down a man who, for all they know, is in another country right now. I am outraged at the Al Queda for what they have done to our country, but at the same time, I am outraged with our country for the hypocrisy it has created.\"\"My behaviors really have not changed at all, I\'m just much more aware of the way things really are in the world- not just the way our parents or the media, etc. want us to see them.\"I think someone might do something like this because they would want to do something to punish us for the pain and anguish that we have caused them.\"Only because of the video tapes, the Al Queda and Osama Bin Laden.\"BECAUSE THEY HATE THE USA AND WHAT WE STAND FOR\"I am shocked that something like this could happen in the usa.  I thought we were so prepared to avoid something like this.  But after thinking about it this past week, I\'m surprised it has not happened sooner.  Our airport security is very lax.  The last time I flew, I did the e-ticket, was met just inside the door with a rep holding a palm computer and was given a boarding pass without showing any ID.  A friend and her husband flew into Boston not long ago and remembers how lax things were there.  After getting lost they asked for assistance and were told to take a stairwell which they did and they ended up in a secured area. The flip side of this is 27 years ago, soming home from Germany with a newborn, I had a go thru many check points and walk the final leg of the concourse alone since my husband could not pass a certain point.  They even looked in the diaper bag I was carrying.  As shocked as I was at the time, it was done and I am not convinced that it is over.  I won\'t be flying any time too soon.  I am ready for the usa to take some action against these terrorists and also against anyone who is here illegally.  I am glad that the government is taking there time though and that they didn\'t just strike out quickly without thinking.  I realize that some innocent lives will be lost  ( as they were 9/11 ) but by waitng and preparing for this strike it may give the innocents time to leave.  I just hope we are not giving the terrorists the same opportunity.  It is hard for me to understand why after the incidents with the USS COLE and the ambassies and the last bombing of the US Trade Center that 1) we weren\'t more prepared and 2) we had not already done somthing about these terrorists being in our country.  They are here not working, but paying their bills, being educated and someone is paying the bills, and given freedom to move about no questions asked.  Maybe we need to be asking questions of Janet Reno and the last administration.\"I won\'t be flying  home to visit my mother and family any time too soon.

'\"i personally believe that the events that took place on sept. 11 were very tragic and dreadful. I personally believed that satan came to this country and caused all the chaos and destruction in this country. Also personally i think that even though Bin laden and his members are blamed for this, i dont think we should blame the views of islam on this. Being a Hindu and having a lot of friends that chose that religion, i understand where they are coming from. I think that religion is always used as a scapegoat for almost everything that happens in this world. I think that we should stop using religion and try using our brains for once and see where the true evil lies. Bin laden being muslim doenst me that all muslims are evil too. Actually most of my friends are angry at bin laden himself for using the name of islam and proving his point. They are all sorry for what has happened in this country and it\'s citzens. In the end i just want to say that we should open our minds to all religions and try to learn the truth about everything before judgking anyone based on their religion.\"Anyone and everyone that supports terrorism not only bin laden and his alliesThey haven\'t changed dramatically but i have opened my heart and mind to other religions and i am trying to learn as much as possible about them.To prove to others that evil can win over good but that is not true.Ideology\"It was a criminal act...murder, and should be treated as such.

At first I thought this was an Israel based thing, but increasingly I\'m thinking that it is an issue, potentially, at least of culture conflict...these people basically want to destroy the west as it presently exists for ideological reasons. I read evolutionary psychology and am aware of the literature on the psychological bases of war, etc etc;  but I\'m afraid that our evolved psychologies are directed toward physical attack, not the kind of  twilight  war that is required here....while the other side can go ahead and do its physical attack thing far more readily.

Of course, our media ties into this by loading Americans with this false sense that we, Americans, are a  good  nation. Do most Americans know what happened to Panamanian rebels after America withdrew? How many Americans know that Pres. Bush promised those rebels support? How many Americans know that Pres. Bush did that same thing in Saudi? It makes me sick to hear people say how we were wrongly attacked and that this is a terrible thing. Please! America has induced WAY MORE terror onto others. This payback was small as far as I\'m concerned. I expected nuclear attacks.\"I\'ve become considerably less optimistic about my future.The people who committed them.A number of factors: a desire to end the domineering global presence of the United States; a need to benefit from religious repression in the Arab countries; a desire to satisfy the ambition and lust for power on the part of the terrorists; and hatred in general.  \"Firstly, like any other rational person, I think, I am overwhlemed with emotions of shock, disbelief, horror, terror, grief, and sadness, at the senselessness of this enormous tragedy. There, having sounded like a politician, let me try to sound like myself: this was senseless and completely unforgivable, but it was *not* the act of madmen who didn\'t know what they were doing; and it pains me to say this, but the United States population has been acting as if we did nothing or said nothing to provoke other countries and their populations into hating us, or resenting us, and that\'s simply a lie. For at least fifty years, the intelligence community of our government has engaged in practices abroad that make the Mafia seem like principled, trustworthy characters by comparison: assassinating foreign leaders,  destabilizing  governments, rigging elections (a practice recently tried to great effect in our own national election last year), and so forth. There\'s no doubt we are a superb country, but we\'re not the only country, and though it may shock people to hear this, our way of life is not the only valid one, and millions of people have a right not to be exactly like us if that is their choice. The Bay of Pigs, the assassination of the Diem (sp?) brothers in Vietnam, the Iran-Contra scheme, and so forth: these are not isolated incidents: they speak to a conscious pattern of U.S government-sponsored interference with and damage to the sovereign affairs of foreign powers. Newton\'s Third Law of Human Behavior states that for every human action there is an equal and sometimes far from opposite reaction: you get back what you put out. If you keep on bullying other people, eventually one of them is going to want to try to hit you back. Nature abhors a vacuum; so, I think what happened is that these evil terrorists, be they Osama bin Laden and his confederates or not, swept into position to put forth their own murderous, despicable agendas, by way of  answering  what they perceived to be a  call  from their countrymen and women to defy this global bully, the United States. As for this shock and disbelief that we, of all peoples, could be harmed by terrorists, we as Americans need to grow up and accept the fact that we live in the same world as a lot of people who disagree with us, and that we should get over our feeling of being special, untouchable,  God\'s chosen country  or whatever. We\'re no better than anybody else, and the sooner we incorporate that into our behavior, the better citizens of this planet we\'ll make. We should absolutely put bin laden and his comrades out of business, permanently and in such a violent way as to take the fun out of terrorism for others who would practice it for all time, but as for going to war with Afghanistan, a country that sent both Britain and the USSR packing and bloodied, I think we\'d better tiptoe along the edges ofthat. The war in Iraq failed to achieve its unstated goals, of unseating Saddam Hussein, and probably created such anger and hatred towards the USA that it may have planted the seeds of this new conflict in the minds ofpeople like bin Laden and others. I\'m afraid of the children of people who are going to be killed in this conflict, growing up to nurse long-standing hatred towards us for this, and wanting to outdo bin Laden by hurting us even more the next time it happens, and I worry that there will be a next time. We seem to think we are removed from the cares of the world, as if America were Mount Olympus and its citizens were gods who could push the rest of the world around, and that just ain\'t so. I condemn wholeheartedly and without reservation the evil deeds committed in the name of a faith and a people who did not want this done to us; I have known many Muslims in my life, not a single one of them a vioolent or dangerous person, and while I am not a MUslim myself, and have no interest in becoming one, I do think we white European Christian types could improve ourselves and our relationships with others by learning about Islam and what it really stands for, and I already know it doesn\'t stand for killing thousands of people in a cowardly and barbaric fashion, so these terrorists don\'t fool me with their talk of jihad. Nor should we be fooled by President Bush\'s talk of a never-ending war on terrorism; this could well be used as an excuse to spend what little money our government has left, now that he\'s given away the Clinton surplus as a feel-good tax cut to the nation, to wage war not only on foreign terrorists but on the civil rtights and civil liberties of decent, law-abiding Americans who may happen to disagree with this government and its juvenile fascination with the military and gunplay, as if they were all little boys in a schoolyard woh think nonviolent discussion and resolution of real problems is a sissy answer. We\'re not little kids, we\'re adults, and we should all---the U.S., the Afghans, the Israelis and the Arabs, the Chinese andRussians and Brits, everybody else---start being adult and looking ast a modern, nonviolent, twenty-first century solution to this terrible mess we\'re all in. Our grandparents and parents got the world into this mess; we should push aside their failed strategies and find something that works better, for our time and our generation. I am, again, neither Arab nor Muslim, but I do not hate Arabs or Muslims; I am neither Jewish nor Christian, but I dot not hate them either; in fact, it\'s safe to say I don\'t hate anybody, but I do hate this tragedy and the deep, dark holw it\'s plunged the world into, and I want us all to make our way out of it and make things right, and there aren\'t enough cruise missiles in the world to bring back one single person who died on September 11. We need a better way to solve this problem.  Long live New York, and America. \"I feel it is a turning point in our country that might signal a new begginning or pride in America and of all Americans that has not been seen for decades. I also worry about what will happen next and how far this war will go. We need to go after these terrorists and should have gone after them a long time ago. Israel has finally been proven right in how to deal with terrorists and we should enlisttheir aid and let them use whatever force they must to stop terroism in their area. We cannot surpress them anymore though I fear President Bush will not allow them to do what is needed. Sept. 11 was a tragedy and a horrible wake up call. We will never be the same. While everyone says we need to get back  to normal  I have to wonder what is normal now ? I don\'t know if we can ever get back to the way things once were and think that  normal  is a term that still needs to be defined in this new age we are now living in.Terrorist networks originating in the Middle East .

I remembered the first WTC bombing and the plot to blow up the tunnels.  Every time I would go into the city I think about these events and wonder when the next time will be.  The WTC attack was a probability to me.  I was in traffic and tuned in to get the traffic report.  The traffic reporter interupted his report on what it looked like on the GWB to state that he had seen what looked to be a plane strike the WTC.  I immediately considered a purposeful act as the weather was perfect.  I knew. As things unfolded I was drawn to go down to the Ocean Parkway as I knew that the towers were visible on clear days.  I saw the plume of smoke, phoned my fiance and next, my parents in Kentucky (originally from New York).  On the way back I saw a pick-up with a big flag flying off the back and thought to myself that we will see flags all over the place ala Desert Storm. For the candle light vigil during which radio stations encouraged people to gather in front of their houses in a show of solidarity, my fiance sat in front of the colonial American flag which flies every day from our porch.  Leaning up against the bench upon which we sat were two assault rifles, a show of defiance.  We prayed and went inside. We visited ground zero two nights ago.  I will never forget the smell.  The feeling of being in a place where so many people perished reminded me of a visit I made to Dachau concentration camp.  The most powerful part was seeing cars covered with dust and debris several blocks away, obviously having belonged to victims. I am angry.\"I am taking advantage of cheaper airfare.

'\"Men who value power, and their arrogance once they\'ve achieved it (on both sides).  These type of men have  been causing death using others\' willingness to kill  and die since history began.  \"\"A small group of men filled with hate decided to kill as many people as possible in the most spectacular way possible, but to what end I am not sure.  It is not clear what they expected to happen as a result. By result I don\'t mean the death and destruction as a direct result of the terrorist acts, but the reciprocal retaliations that will occur into the forseeable future. This is the point at which I am unable to reason further.  I can  understand the hate, the frustration, the religious zeal.  I can\'t understand the desire to see any of the consequences likely to follow. The men were filled with hate for some good reasons.  The United States and its corporations have been exploiting the middle east since taking over from the British after WWII.  These men have seen the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people taken or ruined as the direct result of US policy and actions.  They have also seen the enrichment of the very types of people least deserving or reward, those who are  willing to sell out their brothers for money.  They also feel impotent  to do anything about it.   The mixture of hate, frustration, and a vengeful god who  rewards warriors makes for potent motivation. Having said that, it does not provide us with any bleeker outlook for mankind than has past history which is filled with one horrible event after another.  I don\'t expect to ever see peace on earth.  My deepest thought, that human life is devoid of meaning outside of ourselves,  we are driven by selfish desires mitigated by the need for companionship. All told, that does not pave the road to Nirvana.\"\"Hate, and an assurance that something greater than  themselves makes it righteous.  That can\'t be the whole story, because obvious reprisals and the  spector of cvilian casualties from a long series  of reciprical attacks, makes that reason impotent.

I suspect a Muslim fundamentalist group, backed by one or two foreign states, was responsible.\"\"A deep sadness coupled with a focused angered, tempered by the fear that many of our individual liberities will be needlessly diminished by laws enacted in haste in order to meet the public demand to  do something  about it.  Rather than focus our energies and efforts on taking the fight to our enemies, we will focus on security at home.  It is indeed ironic that the anti-freedom terrorists will have helped diminish freedom in the USA as we start unleash the government to conduct domestic spying on members of the public.  Remember Vietnam when those Americans who opposed the war were viewed as agents of foreign powers and infiltrated by the FBI?  The security organs and restrictions on liberites erected in haste will stay in place long after the threat from terrorism has been eliminated.  I am also appalled by the attacks on Americans of Asian heritage or Americans who follow Islam.  The lessons of the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during the Second World War have been forgotten by a lot of people.  I don\'t want you to get the idea that I am some kind of squishy liberal!  I support revoke the executive order against assassinating foreign enemies!  I support massive military strikes on those states which harbor or fund terrorists.  I believe in taking the battle to our enemies; not imprisoning ourselves in the name of security.  I feel as if the entire nation became one family on September 11th.  I have wept repeatedly every day since then.  Although I didn\'t personnally lose any friends or family in the cataclysm (came close), my feelngs right now are the same as if I were mourning the loss of a close friend or family member.

But people still speed, drink and drive, and use their cell phones while driving.  What about the thousands of people that will die due to smoking or obesity related illnesses?  Should we carpet bomb Phillip Morris or McDonalds with the same righteous fury that we pursue bin Landen?  The political reaction to 9/11 is inappropriate.

When if first happened i couldnt believe it. i was in class and my teacher had not arrived, but one of my friends came in and started telling me and our other friends that a plane had just crashed into the twin towers. No one wanted to believe him. About half an hour passed and out teacher never came so we went out of the classroom and found out she had not gotten there because of the incident. Then we all went to the caffeteria and started listening to the news on the radio and then actually believed what had happened. We Heard from others that classes were canceled for the day, so we left the campus only to find out that no trains or busses were running and that the bridges were being closed off. By now i was feeling some kind of fear. I was living in 162nd Sreet in Manhattan and i had to go home walking. I moved to yonkers about a week ago. Me and 2 of my friends crossed the bridge walking and from there we could see the smoke from the twin towers. Everyone was going CRAZY!. It felt like a bad dream. When i got to 207 i called my mother from a pay phone to make sure she was home and safe. when i called her she informed me that a woman we knew was in one of the towers and no one knew if she was alive. That womans husband works with my father and he(her husband) Left work as soon as this happened and left his car lost in the bronx and walked from there because no vehicles were being let through the bridge. He was also going crazy. Well after all this i got home and started watching the news all day. everything i saw was very shocking to me, especially to see people jumping out of windows on the very high floors, and seeing the towers collapse. It seemed unreal like a movie or something. in couldnt believe it. i also found out that another man i knew was in one of the towers too.    Although i wasn\'t close to these 2 people, i was saddened by their deaths...till this day of september 25th, they have not been found, and i feel fery sorry for their families. Overall i think this was an extremely cruel act on behalf of those terrorists, and i think that this incident unified the country. At the present moment i fear my life because those terrorists dont care about themselves or any one, and the latest news i heard was that they were threatning to infect the city with some kind of virus or gas that will kill off many people. This is a situation i would never want to face. I\'m praying to God it doesn\'t occur because im too young to die and i have alot of goals i want to achieve. I also would not like to see anything happen to my loved ones. Thats about all i have to say about this.\"They haventHatred and EnvyOsama\"My first perspective on the events of 9/11/01 was one of disbelief, it then shifted to anger, then numness and has now shifted to logic.

'\"On the 11th, I was shocked, horrified and alarmed.  The event awakened the grief of the recent death of my mother.  I also had, and still have, a premonition that there a number of additional \'sleeper\' agents planted throughout the world who would be willing to continue this carnage and that their fanatical dedication would be difficult to eradicate. Today I recognize that this attack has ignited an endless series of tit-for-tat retaliatory raids that will last of decades.  To some degree we will have been drawn in to a middle east situation that will last for years.  I suspect that it will take at least 5000 military/investigative personnel to eliminate each terrorist.  Terrible odds for a country that has the attention span of a sitcom.\"Apparently a result of fantatical religious beliefs.\"Not much, I have a slight lingering sense of concern for my children and grandchildren.

Will the people who planned and executed the deeds of Sept. 11 wish they had not?  In the end, I think they will. I\'m smart enough to know I\'m studpid, that is, I don\'t understand the rationale, be it personal, political, religious or nationalistic, that drives someone to mastermind the fall of the World Trade Center buildings.  I can imagine the terrorists saying to themselves,  We\'ll attack the World Trade Center (and some other places) and then the Americans will _______.   The probelm is, those people had the hubris to fill in the blank.  Many a would-be hero has been brought down by his own arrogance.\"A hateful person.I\'m sadder.Dont know\"The WTC and Pentagon attack was shocking, particularly when I heard about it happening when the rocket attack was occuring in Kabul. With the initial information indicating simultaneous trouble at such distant places it seemed like a global conflict had started. Maybe it will lead to global conflict, but I praise the US for waiting and considering its response, rather than a knee-jerk PR strike. I think its important not to attack civilians in Afghanistan or other countries in an attempt to get \'justice\' for the victims of this attack. I think the world has changed since the attacks, many attitudes and expectations are now different. If the follow-on conflict creates more hatred against the US and the west, then the terrorists will have won no matter what happens to any specific terrorist group. Lets be carefull what seeds are sown. The 6000+ victims are an enormous loss. I wish their families and friends may bear the grief and achieve some peace and acceptance of their loss. I think the media has devoted far too much air-time replaying the images of the impact and endless side issues in the first couple of days. This 24-hour coverage added to the world-wide stress without adding much extra information.\"Dont knowMonitor news much more frquentlyNo major changes.

I do not cosider myself a pessimist, but I feel that our country might have brought this upon its citizens.  It was a horrible, horrible tradegy that could have been avoided.  I think Americans have no clue how other countries see us.  What would we expect when we make up 5 percent of the worlds population and consume 50\% of its goods.  Even through all of that, I still get caught up in being manipulated by the media with feelings of patriotism because I simplydo not know all I want to about what has happened.\"Not yet.Unbelievable. Cruel. Trajedy. Drama...Revenge.\"It seems that everyone thinks Bin Laden is responsible, and that evidence is growing against him. If this really is hard evidence, then I can do no else than agree. However, what would you leave behind as evidence/tracks etc. when you would commit such an attack ?

How can you believe so much in a cause, even a misguided one?  What is sticking with me most is grief.  So many innocents killed - so many children orphaned.  And horror over the people who were trying to climb down dozens of flights of stairs and knowing they wouldn\'t make it.  I\'m worried that we will lash out as a nation and kill more innocents, and make violence spiral even more.  I\'m angry at my fellow Americans who would use this as an excuse for racism and a corrosive nationalism (as opposed to a healthy patriotism).  I\'m even, a week after, now a little hopeful that this will pull the nation together and make people realize that we need to work together for common goods.\"I honestly don\'t know.  I find it hard to reconcile religious fanaticism with the fact that some of the terrorists are reported to have gone out drinking.\"Osama bin Laden provided the inspiration, but many misguided people participated.

The event signaled a rough and uncertain road ahead that will undermine the quality of live for people everywhere.  Everyone who wants to be happy and live their lives in peace must confront the fact that life will not be as enjoyable and satisfying in the months and years ahead as the world deals with the threat of terrorism.  Although I also felt angry, unlike many people, I didn\'t feel a desire for revenge or retribution.  We must take strong military actions against terrorism, but for behavioral control rather than revenge.  \"I am afraid that people will hold many stigmas against middle eastern people thus creating a lot of hate crimes and contempt for americans of middle eastern descent000\"I feel that although the events that occured on September 11 were undoubtedly well planned, they were an act of desperation.  Yes, they have achieved the desired effect of driving fear into the hearts of the citizens of the United States, but our retaliation surely must have been foreseen.  I understand that the United States may not have the absolute best military in the world, but we are far better trained and more numerous than any army a terrorist group could attempt to throw together.  As for the fact that terrorists are attempting to use guerilla-style tactics to defeat our army, they seem to have neglected the fact that the US military has a wide variety of organizations within the Special Operations community that are trained for just such tactics.  Maybe they thought that they could recreate a vietnam-type situation.  Perhaps they didn\'t count on the overwhelming willingness of this country to go to war.\"\"Desperation, pure and simple.  These people were desperate to strike fear into the hearts of our countrymen, yet they had to realize that we would not just sit back and be afraid.\"\"I feel that Osama bin Laden is behind the attacks, but hardly working alone.  Although he may be independantly wealthy, that does not account for having highly-trained commandos to pilot these flights.  That indicates to me a very signifigant amount of government backing, and from what I\'ve learned, the Taliban seems to be the most likely culprit.  However, I do not discount the possibility that there are other major players involved.  Perhaps he was backed by the very same people who are now claiming to be on our side in the war against terrorism.\"\"None whatsoever.

Second, I think that is a call from the rest of the world saying stop telling what to do.

I believe it is the United States government\'s responsibility to destroy the network of terrorists responsible for this hideous act of violence. I believe that attempts to deal with the  underlying cause  however well intentioned, are basically a waste of time. As one commentator put it, bin Laden wants to live in the 14th century, and he wants to murder you if you don\'t want to join him. And as Martin Perez put it, we\'re all Israeli\'s now.\"\"factions of fundamentalist Islamic groups see the Western, and particularly US presence in many parts of their lives--movies, clothing, games; style and entertainment in general. the values of materialism and  pleasures of the flesh  are at odds with muslim ideals, in their view, and they feel unable to stem the tide in any way except by committing horrible violent attacks on the united states. because of lack of education, they are unable to the irrationality in their response, and the degree to which it runs counter to their core religious beliefs--an instance of religious brainwashing not unlike the james jones incident and many others in the history of religion. \"\"Islamic fundamentalist terrorist groups, financed by asama bin laden. perhaps iraq. maybe afganistan. \"hesitant about business air travel\"because they can..and they don\'t care about anything, or anybody, if they are outside the box in which they live.\"Bin Ladenno change\"It was never a question of  if  but of when, having served over 20 years in the U.S. Air Force, along with being stationed in Saudia Arabia during the 1996 attack at Dahuran AB, I can not help but remember that we all thought we were a target then, and that not enough was been done to prevent an attack, we as a country have this abilily to get over things, to move on as if the last bad thing to happen, will be the last bad thing... so we move on get back to our lives, our normal lives where things are as they should be, where all the really bad things happen to other people in other places, not us, not here, besides we are the  good guys .

Certainly makes the grokking of the whole affair possible. It could be that from some perspectives, such acts are seen as the only way to further a socio/economic/political agenda. Of course, without an explanation from those  responsible  it makes all of this purely hypothetical. We have nothing really to frame the discussion.  Its a reaction to this or that.   Could be we are dealing with the minds of a few people interpreting the rhetoric of the currently popular bogeymen. Maybe Bin Laden said,  go hurt america!  and so some folks took some cash from some group and put togehter a plan. Just because people are poor, or extremely angry doesn\'t cancel out their intelligence. What they did demonstrates a lucid understanding of how to operate domestically against this country.  Maybe we are dealing with some diabolical mind ala James Bond. Who knows, point is we the people don\'t. Perhaps someone in the intelligence world has a better picture. However, John and Jane Q. Public will make up their minds in the information vacuum and build their opinion based on the bullshit floating around on the airwaves. I really dislike T.V.\"\"I have not fully processed the events of last week, as I doubt many have. I was in the process of getting wrung out from the flu when the sh-t hit the fan. So last week while everyone talked about the import of what happened and watched news and thought, I was barely able to think, lying around with a fever and a horrible cough. I don\'t think, however, that I will miss any opportunities to discuss what is going on. Since I am not (to my knowledge) intimately involved with the death it is perhaps easier for me to step back and wonder about how this nation will react in the months to come. In fact I feel removed from the anger and fear, as the fallout from this act has barely rippled the fabric of my community here in Montana in any tangible way. Sure, there is discussion but life largely goes on undisturbed. Unlike what my parents in Seattle see and hear, with missle frigates in Puget Sound and figher planes messing up everyone\'s sleep, screaming about the night sky.  What I do fear, however, is that our  leadership  will take a more bombastic (and bombing) approach to dealing with the Nation\'s turmoil than I would like. While I do not deny people\'s desire (and perhaps my own, though not well developed) for a tangible revenge, I truly hope that any use of force is thoroughly thought out. All this call for blood and for  relaxing  our view on  collateral damage  scares me. It\'s  patriot talk  for wanting the American people to allow the occasional indiscriminant killing of innocent bystanders to be done in our name. We know the bad guy is in room 17c so lets blow up the whole building and call it good. The hawks point the finger and shout that Bin Laden doesn\'t care about killing the innocent and if we don\'t adopt his manners then we will never be able to effectively combat him and his followers. May be. However, if we follow his path will we be vigilant enough to be able to discern, down the road, the difference between  us  and  them . At what point will our use of those tactics blend with their use? What will make us more right? Won\'t our rhetoric and their rhetoric mirror each other? It already does in some ways.  I worry that fundamental introspection will not occur. That an in depth look at the reasons why people are so angry with America won\'t take place. More Americans need to think about why so many dislike our political state, our economic might. We have potentially huge paradigmatic shifts ahead of us - how we face them will tell a lot about the character of our nation.  Pain, rage, horror, deep sadness, fear, exhilaration, bonding - all potent catalysts. Maybe in our healing we can look at other wounds and societal illnesses that have been swept under the carpet of our national conscience. We would be fools to think that our own Nation\'s ills do not reverberate through the global politic and influence the way our country is viewed and treated by other nationalities.  \"\"Define responsible. Hard question. Various intellectual and emotional leaders from various regions around the world have guided various people to commit horrible acts. Vague yes, but pointing only to one man seems tragically myopic - as if killing Bin Laden or Hussein will end the trouble. It could be said that the predominant economic paradigm of resource consumption and  free  market capitalism played a role, helping to keep a vast majority of the world\'s population in a state of deprivation. A group of people who are hungry, poor, and live daily with the fear that some state organization will bust down their door and bust open their head is a prime petri dish for breeding minds that feel disenfranchised in total. What have they got to lose by stapping semtex to their bodies? \"\"It has reinforced my dislike for television.

It was quite a surprise. The funny thing is that it didn\'t immediatley affect me, but after a several days. Now, as I see the innocent Muslims, Arabs, and Sikhs being harassed, I feel even more anger towards the cowardly acts of the terrorist.

As an Army Veteran and Military Historian, I find it dumb-founding how this country can continually let down its guard.  I can\'t understand how we can be so duped into believing that our immigration laws, rules and regulations have been effective.  When are we going to start to close the flood gates of humanity coming to America?  We can\'t care for the entire world; we can\'t even care for those who are already here in the country!  Do we keep letting people in until there is standing room only?  We made ourself vulnerable because of our devil may care attitudes about bringing in  the poor and huddeled masses.   I\'m angry because we set ourselves up for this.  Every human being comingintothe U.S. needs to be closely scrutinized; thorough background checks on these wanting to imigrate and much tighter visitor visas.  No other nation on Earth, save for maybe the Canadians, are more vulnerable to outside attacks ... from the INSIDE!   If we are to make this nation a safer place for our children and families, we have to take a number of measures right away: 1)  No more carry on luggage--period. 2)  Titanium walls and kevlar coverings to all airliner cockpits. 3)  All FBI and ATF agents, police officers, deputy sherriffs, court authorities and other legally armed indivudals be required to wear their side arms during domestic flights. 4)  Increase spending for the CIA and FBI; hire many more agents and establish entire units specialized in domestic anti-terrorim. 5)  Provide more authority and grant more trust to the military to act independently to strike targets of opportunity where terrorim is  breeding  or being trained. 6)  Revoke all current visas in this country and bring every one in from Middle Eastern, African, Eastern Europe and Asian countries for questioning. 7)  DO Not grant any new visas until after the war on terrorism is well under way; even then, closely scrutinize every single person wanting admission into the U.S. 8)  Tighten our borders with Mexico and Canada, and increase Coast Guard patrols with more ships and sailors. 9)  Close Reagan National airport permanently.  On that spot, build an anti-aircraft, anti-missle complex and leave the field for use by military jets on ready/stand-by alert. 10)  Close the airspace out to all civilian traffic out ten miles around Washington, D.C.  Shot down any unauthorized air traffic. 11)  Repeal the 1976 act stating that we can not asassinate the heads of foriegn states or nations. 12)  Bring the Russians in as full partners with NATO to erradicate terrorism worldwide.  Working in close assocaition with the Russians, we must reward them for their efforts and involvement. 13)  Stop all tax rebates and increase our income tax by 2\% to pay for the war effort. 14)  Issue war bonds for Americans and our friends to invest. 15)  Bring the war on drugs in on this war on terrorism; illegal drugs are a form of terrorism of our population.

God Bless America and her legal citizens.\"\"it did not change, but I am staying 4000 miles east of Ney York City.\"\"Usama Bin Laden or related people, or US militias (e.g. guys like Timothy Veigh who bombed the government building in Oklahoma)\"\"I was completly shocked at that day, and I could not work (it was 3 a.m. local time).  Yesterday I taped a tv documentary with all the pics of the planes hitting WTC. Sometimes I still think I am just in a movie, but not in the real world.  I am deeply concerned what will happen next. Violoence/war is neither an appropriate answer nor will it solve any problems with terrorism. Also  President  (was he really elected) Bush must take much more care in international affairs. Isolationism will result in a world wide chaos.  The values of the western society (which is also shared by the vast majorites of muslims, too) require that the US do not longer support states or activities of states which do not meet democratic standards. In the past the US choosed allies which were against the common enemy (the Soviet Union), but not for democratic values.  The impact of the events will be that the next air travels will be much more time consuming, but I think it is necessary. In May I was in the US, and I was really astonished about what they call controls at the airport. In Europe the controls are much stricter. Maybe I am disorganised, but I think these terror acts will determine US national and international politics for a long time. Hopefully terrorism will vanish, but in Germany that lasted 20 years (the RAF, they wanted a revolution in Germany using violocende, killing representatives of the states and eceonomic leaders)   \"hate and fanatism\"I don\'t know, out of pure hatred I guess\"Ohsama Bin Lahden\"I was actually pulling into the parking lot of the college where I am attending when I first heard the news about the planes striking the World Trade Center towers, and at first thought I didn\'t give any attention to it because I assumed that it was due to some weather condition such as fog. But later after my first class that day I began hearing reports of other planes being hijacked and crashing into other areas of the U.S. Soon after that the school decided to post tv\'s around the various halls and, study rooms, and lounges in order for students to know what was going on. The first feeling I guess I had was fear, because no one new exactly what was going on and how many planes had been hijacked. The entire event reminds me that we live in a society where we are vulnerable to attack, that we\'re not invincable like so many of us believe we are. I don\'t believe that I ever felt revenge because the events never effected me personaly. My heart went out to those who lost loved ones, and my heart continues to go out to those families and people. I did feel a deeper sense of patriotism, and found it really encouraging that the country seemed to find that feeling also. But I am discouraged at the fact that it took a tragedy like this to ignite our sense of patriotism. I have a very deep respect now for the men and women in our police departments and fire departments who put their lives on the line daily to serve and protect. I feel that we have done an excellent job as a people and a  country of continuing on and triumphing through this tragedy. I think that it shows how the will to survive and thrive through circumstances and trials is a trait that all people share. I was upset at the outbreak of racism towards the people of Middle Eastern ethnicity living here in the U.S., and towards those who practiced Islam. I think there was no reason for any racism, and I was extremely upset at the media for showing video of children in Middle Eastern countries dancing and celebrating the tragedy. That in itself did not help race realtions one bit, and could have been left out of the media. Overall I feel a lot more vulnerable than I did before Sept. 11, which I guess is a feeing that I\'m going to need to learn to deal with because the world is not as safe as it once was, even on American soil.   \"\"Not much has changed, I have spent a lot more time in pray for the president and for those in charge.\"I understand from the media that Islamic terrorists are behind themIgnoranceNo change really ... just sadnessHaving been in the US on a number of occasions and having been in the Trade Centre and enjoyed the wonderful hospitality of Americans - my initial response was one of shock and disbelief - which gave way to immense saddnes and sense of horror at what people had experienced and were still experiencing as we watched. Deepest thoughts and feelings? How lost people who do such things are.  How \'care-less\' for people and order and freedom.  A profound sense of saddness which remained.  As a minister of a Presbyterian Church in NZ I held a special service the Sunday evening following where people came for the first time - some of them - and lit a candle and prayed and cried.  On the Wednesday morning - when we heard it in NZ - we hold a small communion service.  This morning those who came - including myself - wept as we saw in the symbols of broken bread and poured out wine - the sensless killing of the innocents in NY and Wash. (Hmmm - where is page 2?)none0Hadred of the USA and our foreign policies in the Middle East/Islamic WorldTerrorists in sympathy with the ideology of bin LadenOsama bin Laden\'s network of terrorists\"The United States dropped the ball.  The old CIA should have taken Osama bin Laden out, years ago.  Sure, that would make the U.S. the terrorists and/or murderers, however, one  extremist  life compared to whatever the total of lives lost turns out to be.  You do the math.  Not to mention the livelyhoods of all the people who have or will lose their jobs over all of this  activity.   It just makes me sick.  Is it not the job of the federal government to protect the lives and interest of the people of the United States?   Taking out  that nut and all his followers was and is the job of the U.S. federal government.  \"\"Just angry that someone could do ALL of this to OUR country.  Kill ALL of those people, have ALL of those people lose their jobs and do ALL the things that has been done to OUR already struggling economy. \"Greed\"At base, we all are.  The immediate perpetrators, the guys that commited suicide are clearly responsible, but we can\'t punish them.  They were encouraged by others, who were ultimately responding in the best way that they know how, to correct, (or at least point out) wrongs (terrorism?) that we have commited.\"\"My first response was astonishment and disbelief.  I didn\'t belief the buildings could fall until they did.  As events unfolded, I suspected that the fourth plane was stopped by some heroic action, although I thought it was heroic action by the crew.  I was relieved and deeply moved when it became clear that that hijacking was foiled by the passengers. I have been expecting something like this for a long time, so the actual events were not that much of a surprise.   Earth Changes  have long been predicted by the indiginous people of North America, and, from their perspective, it was inevitable.  I had accepted that (unwillingly) a long time ago.  Although, I admit, I had expected it to be precipitated by a natural calamity (earthquake, tidal wave, or some such) rather than a man-made event. At no time have I felt any anger toward the perpetrators nor their supporters.  I feel that they think they had something important to say, and  we  weren\'t listening, so they did something to make us realize that they really meant it. My sense is that it has to do with  fairness , but I haven\'t heard anyone in the media use that term. I find the choice of targets interesting.  They attacked the symbols of world trade and military organization.  They did not attack the population at large or attempt to destroy the infrastructure (eg. poisoning the water supply or destroying electricity production.)  Their argument is with the forces of international trade (globalization) and the military (use of force to impose will). There have been protests against these institutions in the past.  (Protests in Seattle, peace marches around the Pentagon.)  And nothing came of it.  It is only natural for the protesters to increase the volume of their protests until they are heard. What scares me the most is the apparent  unified  response to this.  Statements made by the U. S. President that claim to be speaking for all Americans certainly do not speak for me.  Answering violence with violence can only lead to more violence. The only answer that will work is to recognize that the violence we just experienced is a direct result of our own violence (Grenada, Gulf War, etc.) and we must atone for the terrorism we have commited.  We must honor our own dark side, because these acts of terrorism against us are simply a reflection of our own attitudes toward the rest of the world. When we can honor our own evil side, we can sit down and talk to those who condone this sort of terrorism, and say,  OK.  What\'s your grievance?  How can we work together and share this world fairly.   We must recognize the value of different cultures and different value systems. In fact, it is irresponsible not to celebrate diversity.  Different cultures have different values, and it is exactly that difference that greases the wheels of cultural and economic exchange. All this talk about a  War on Terrorism  frightens me way more than the thought of another plane falling on innocent people.  This war is going to affect us all. The longer this war proceeds, the greater the Terrorists victory.  We can stop it by simply not starting it.  But I\'m afraid we won\'t.\"\"To make a statement.  To point out the inequities of the system.  To show how angry they are.  To say  If the world continues like this, life isn\'t worth living.  \"\"Somewhat.  I cancelled an airplane trip on Sept 18.  I\'m praying a lot more than I have in the past.  I\'m writing letters to my political representatives.  I\'m reading a lot about the events, mainly about the root causes and motivations of this event.\"\"None, really. Watch a lot of CNN.\"\"I\'m trying to focus on the underlying reasons of why this happened. Obviously, one feels tremendous sorrow for the victims, and anger directed at what appear (to Western culture) to be irrational acts by lunatics.  The real issue for me is how did we get to the point that people were determined to commit such acts? Is it the US involvement in the Palestinian question? (Some have interpreted even mentioning this possibility as being anti-semetic, which is not the case here). Is it the presence of Americans in Saudi Arabia? Or perhaps both of these issues are at play along with other issues. I simply don\'t know. I do know, however, that until we get at why this happened, we will not  solve  the problem. We will not  win  (however that is defined). In their socially constructed reality, the terrorists do not see themselves as irrational. I find the commentary by people who have actually lived in Afganistan or similar cultures most useful in trying to understand what do do. I hope our elected officals do the same. Even they admit the situation is much more complex than anything miltary action alone can accomplish. Only in that way can we avoid more grief and  the cycle of destruction. \"Direct responsibility is presumably with the radical groups that everyone suspects. I suspect Osama is the money source behind this. I still suspect some government might be involved at some level.See my inital answer. I have guesses and that\'s about it.\"This is the most important question.  I believe that there is fertile ground for extremism always in poverty.  And the people of the Middle East are desperately poor even when their corrupt and undemocratic governments are rich.  So charismatic leaders with destructive and inhumane messages, like bin Laden and his colleagues, have a ready army of poor, easily swayed youth to enlist in their overblown and egotistical cause.  Because extremist individuals will always exist, it is important for our government to  pursue just policies that do not fan the flames of extremism.  If bin Laden were an isolated evil genius, the towers would still be standing and your Web site would not exist.  It is the unjust and miserable conditions that the US has exacerbated that allowed his message to take root.  To name a few: our suport for a shameful monarchy in Saudi Arabia, our insistence on propping up Israel and embarrassing even moderate Palestinian leaders , and our ten-year cmpign of bombing and sanctions in Iraq which has taken so many innocent lives and turned the Arab world -- no lovers of Saddam Hussein -- against us. Looking rte other way when Pervez Musharraf seized power in Pakistan didn\'t exactly help our image in that coubtry, either.\"\"My wife and I and our neighbors watched the twin towers burn and crumble from the roof of our apartment building across town.  It was the most beautiful day, so incongruous, because I could turn my head slightly and everything was as perfect as the world could be, and then I would turn back and the implications of what was happening would flood my mind.  So many of the tangle of thoughts -- many of them seemingly contradictory -- that I was having as we watched the towers fall, I still have.  They have developed, fleshed out or whatever, but the basic thoughts are the same.  My personal process has been not to try too hard to process.  I have wanted to try and just sit with the feelings, the conflicting tendencies in my analysis, the range of emotions.  I believe that all that death will be in vain if I as an individual, we as a community, and we as a nation collectively cannot learn and grow from these deaths and what they have brought into our lives.  My experiences have taught me that I will not learn and grow if I do not absolutely GO THROUGH the experience, the raw, painful, weirdness of it all. So I find myself bouncing around.  Some of the different things that rush through me: Absolute sadness and grief at the magnitude of the lives lost, of the senselessness of each one of the deaths.   Anger at the US Government for pursuing policies that boil down to greed, for so long; throughout the middle East and the world at large, my government has for too long made alliances of convenience and self-interest rather than alliances of principle, ethical and lasting alliances, and we have burned through the natural good will of many people and peoples, and so we are left with what bad leaders have always been left with -- the need to use force and deception to hold back a rising tide of legitimate distrust and anger from the world\'s poor and oppressed.  A feeling of resignation that there is a kind of karma at work here, but also total anger that when the karma flies, it\'s innocent people who have to duck, innocent people who are blown out into the sky and whose bodies are vaporized, just like it\'s innocent women and children who have died in the hundreds of thousands in Iraq for 10 years, innocent Palestinian families who get caught in the crossfire on the West Bank, innocent Israeli schoolkids who get hardened and twisted to the life of the occupier, the never-safe, innocents everywhere flying out of exploding windows and getting burned in bomb blasts and strafed by artillery or starving and diseased from the effects of war.  I\'m so fucking sick of the slaughter of the innocents by the designs of the leaders of the world, who do their grim fucking business of detah, who go on their big fucking adventures and leave the rest of us at risk, leave postal workers dying of anthrax and everyone scared. Total violent rage at extremists who would claim that their religion not only justifies but demands the slaughter of innocents, the instillation of fear and pain in the hearts of their fellow human beings.  Despite all the humanist and leftist sentiment expressed above (and I am a humanist lefty by definition), I nonetheless will find myself wishing for the easy satsfaction of the total annihilation of the Taliban, the hunting down of bin Laden and his best and brightest generals, the torching of the schools where the narrowest and most violent interpretations of Islam take root -- in short, I find myself wanting war, wanting my country to kick ass. An extreme and almost painful tender-heartedness for everything in this sad world. Fear, total debilitating fear.   The desire to defiantly stay here in NYC, to cast my lot with my city for better or worse because if there\'s one thing I feel pride of place for, it\'s this remarkable, beautiful mosaic of people and the archaeological layers of human history here, yet the urge to leave, to run way, head for the hills of Northern Canada or Vermont or the Blue Ridge Mountains -- away from the targets.  The strong desire to take my wife and just go off somewhere we could have a garden and animals and kids and not live in the fucked-up world we know. I have spent a lot of time and energy trying to have good conversations with the Arab-Americans I meet, to try and counter the potential perceptions of mistrust between us, yet I sometimes find my mind wandering to the possibility that the nice Palestinians who run my local deli are really al Quaeda operatives just waiting for their cell to be activated and that one day I\'ll find my kindness repaid by a poisonous coffee!  So ridiculous, yet my mind wanders there, it\'s embarrassing even to admit to myself.  But these are the kinds of times we have to deal with. I\'ve also experienced something like joy at the way we New Yorkers have reacted, like a big family all grieving together, all trying to make it right, it just touches me so much when I think of how all of us were on the streets on Sept. 12, 13, 14, and beyond, doing whatever we could to pitch in, and how even now our civic encounters are markedly more polite, considerate, kind, careful, and filled with an implicit appreciation that we are all still here alive.  I cry just thinking about it. The memorials.  The candles and flowers that sprung up all over the streets and the parks and the doorsteps and the businesses and the firehouses and police precincts and everywhere.  It\'s like when someone you know dies, it\'s hard to maintain the kinds of daily illusions we have about the relative importance of things.  Like, ok, our jobs or the ball game or the next hollywood movie or that little spat with your friend or your partner -- like, who cares?  When you are faced with death, your priorities become clear -- and we are all so similar at our roots when these priorities are revealed.  That\'s what it\'s been like here.  And I don\'t want that to fade.  I don\'t want us to  get back to normal.   I don\'t care if the Yankees win the world series or if I make a lot of money.  I just want to feel like we are all appreciative of how fragile our existence is on this earth, and how much we and others can do to fuck it up, to take it for granted, or to just blow it altogether. My father turned 90 years old the weekend that the US started bombing Afghanistan.  He cried.  I thought, how heartbreaking, to live 90 years and feel like the only thing to change is the weapons.  He was an FDR man, he had high ideals and hopes for his country and his world.  He believed in the power of liberalism to change people\'s lives for the better.  He thought his government could be principled, thought his world could be peaceful and safe AND just.  We all believe in something when we\'re young, and thenw atch it betray us, I guess. I told the Palestinian guy at my local deli about my dad crying, and he looked sad too.  He said he hoped that when he and I were 90 years old, we  lived in a world with no guns, no weapons at all.   I think the biggest thing has been the smell.  We live close enough to  Ground Zero  that everytime they uncover a new smoking beam, or move the rubble around, we\'re liable to get hit with the smoke and stench.  And after a few weeks it really took its toll.  You realize that you are breathing in dangerous stuff, for one, no matter what officials say.  But more deeply, you feel stress and sadness and depression because on a biological level you are walking around doing this very important work of CLEANING THE AIR, taking the smoldering smoky electrical fire-tinged air into your lungs and breathing out something cleaner and new.  We are all of us doing this all the time, procesing the air to make everything ok again.  And it is very emotionally exhausting.  And deeper still, we are of course breathing in the ashes of the dead.  We ARE their vessels, their memorials, we are taking their ashes and their spirits into our bodies and carrying them around with us, literally metabolizing them, they are in some way becoming part of us.  It is abstract to think that way, but it\'s also physically true, and that is a profound thing that effects all of us whether we realize it or not.  I\'ve actually started going to church -- I\'ve been an atheist for the most part all my life, but church is the only place publicly where anyone is saying exactly what I feel like needs to be said.  It feels good to go there and cry and sing and hear people express the human dimensions of all this tragedy. I guess the last thing I am left with is this: when I have read about bombings and wars and collateral damage and civilian casualties over the years, I have of course been concerned on some level, but I have found it easy to go ahead and turn the page, turn off the TV, and go back to my life unchanged.  That\'s the key word, unchanged.  I mean, how much did Oklahoma City really effect me?  Or the latest round of conflict in the West Bank?  Or even the schoolkids in Northern Ireland getting shot on their way to class?  Honestly, not as much as they should have.  I think back and I don\'t think I even shed a single tear for Oklahoma City.  But having stood on my roof on that cloudless, blue, sunny day and watched the towers collapse, having heard my wife cry  Oh no, oh, no, oh no  in real time as the towers fell, having watched the clouds of smoke rise up from the streets and cover the whole city, having known people who were touched directly and indirectly by deaths too numerous to mention, having seen this in my own city and my own life for the first time, I guess I want to change, I want to admit that it has changed me forever, and I don\'t ever want it to be ok anywhere or anytime or any way it happens.  \"\"I don\'t take the subway if I can avoid it.  I am fearful of anthrax.  I am filled with conflicting emotions and analyses.  I try to be patient with myself and others in ways I might not have before.  I cry a lot more.  I say  I love you,  and  Be safe  a lot more to people, especially my wife.  I am drawn more and more to cats and dogs.  I am a musician, and I find myself playing and writing more ngry and loud music, less mellow stuff.  My self-promotional activities feel relly stupid and I have a hard time doing them.  I have a hard time concentrating at work.  I have weird dreams and a hard time sleeping.  While I don\'t feel patriotic about my country, I do feel incredibly proud of my city.  I\'ve started attending church regularly, which I have never done before in my life.\"\"I think there is plenty of blame to go around in a larger sense, but I ultimately believe that an act like this is unacceptable and the individuals who plan and perpetrate it must take final responsibility -- so I believe that radical fundamentalist Muslims planned and perpetrated the hijackings and are guilty of mass murder.\"',4,-5,0,2,5,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,2.98,0,9.33,0.4,0,0,0,0,0.4,0.6,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,4.57,2.18,0,0.4,1.19,0.4,0,0,2.19,0,0,0,1.19,0.4,0,0.6,0,25.03,0,2.38,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,34.17,3.57,0,1.19,0,0.4,0,0.79,0,0.4,0.6,0,0,0,0,9.53,9.14,1.59,0.6,0,0,1.19,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.99,0.4,0,0.99,Male
'\" For me it was a feeling of finally the other shoe had dropped. The terrible possibilities that I have felt were up in the air had become a concrete reality experienced by all. No longer did I feel the dissonance of having the world around me blythely going along the most trivial tangents avoiding any hint of realization of how dangerous our world had become and how precarious our expected mainstays actually were. History teaches that the first calendar year of a century sees the eruption of a new and terrible war which is the birth of that new century. Now that it has happened it can be dealt with. Quickly it has become clear the opposing forces of this new war are all forms of inflexible fundamentalism vs. freedom or flexibility of symbolic idealism. Falwell and those involved in anti-middle easters hate crimes have made clear that Christian and American  fundamentalism is as much of an enemy as the political and business interests represented by Ben Laden and Hamas.   In the \'60\'s we spoke of the confrontaiton of those who love life and those in charge of the machinery of death. Like the \'Age of Aquarius\' such notions referred to things that can only make sense to the general public now in this new century/millennium. Unlike the \'60\'s when we attempted to simply say these things or write them in slogans on protest placards or express them in our fashions and lifestyle; now it is clear this must be explained in simple concrete terms understandable to those of conservative and fundamentalist perspectives here and around the world.     In terms of the casualties, which includes parts at least psychic and mental of all of us, I grieve them in general as a human reaction to the awareness of human pain and loss. Beyond that, they are war casualties and in a war perspective, such tragedy is cause for quick grief and lasting resolve, eyes on the prize of future battle and victory and hopefully a realization of the human tragedy of war and that the campaigns be wage with a minimum of causualties on all sides.\"To promote their personal interests and advantageFundamentalists and political interests of the Arab nations who mistakenly think it is only a matter of one good defeat to get the US to run away and leave them to expand their empire.Being more polite from a greater compassion for those who can not understand what is going on or why things are now so different than they expect.\"The events of 9/11/2001 were the most cruel attacks that the U.S. has ever sustained and could be the most cruel attacks that this world has ever seen.  It was not just the lives taken in the 3 different areas, but the lives that will be lost due to the retaliation efforts by the U.S. and its allies. The terrorists\' attacks were essence a \'natural catastrophy\'.  The damage caused to lower Manhatten was worse than what a 7.8 earthquake did to Los Angeles in the \'90s.  No hurricane has ever taken so many lives nor has a tornado or flooding.  It makes me sick everytime I think about the passengers on the planes that crashed into the WTC and Pentagon--what could have they been thinking when they were flying over NYC. But through this horrible time in US history heroes have emerged and that will have a more lasting effect on the US than the attcks.  Who will ever forget the brave passengers on the flight that crashed in Pennsylvania?  That was truly heroic and will go down as one of the most heroic actions this country will or has ever seen.\"We as the US are not invincible to attack.  We can be hurt and we can be threatened.

Since no recognized or otherwise legitimate government declared war in conjunction with that act, it cannot be considered an act of war.  One of the differences between organized crime and urban guerrilla warfare is the ideology of the participants.  Only ideology that supports the liberation or creation of a State can be rightfully called a doctrine of military intent.  Such military strategy is usually called guerrilla warfare.  All other forms of terrorism, including religious or criminal terrorism are not military in nature; thus, we cannot declare war on it (other than metaphorically).  A more accurate description of this type of activity is institutional corruption. One of the dangers of using the metaphor of war is that it can easily be used to mask the corruption it was supposed to eradicate. Some examples in American history are: The War on Crime:  Crime has us surrounded.  The Ministry of Peace says we are making progress every year.   Status: The STATE is fighting urban guerrilla warfare to free itself from the evil Crime empire.   The War on Drugs:  Drugs already won this war (see 18th(declaration) and 21st(unconditional surrender) amendments).  The Ministry of Truth says we can win.   Status: The STATE is fighting  saboteur style  guerrilla warfare to continue a war it already lost.   The War on Poverty:  Poverty is still firmly entrenched on all sides.  Depending on the accounting method being employed by the Ministry of Truth, the poor are making more and living better than ever before, and the rich are getting richer.   Status:  The STATE is fighting WWI style trench warfare, where progress is measured in yards. Our new war: The War on Terrorism:  Too new for description.  The Ministry of Truth says this war can be won.  The Ministry of Peace commented that they prefer to war with uniformed opponents. Status:  The STATE is considering upgrading its powers to POLICE STATE.  It should be noted; however, that in WWII, when the a STATE upgraded even beyond POLICE STATE to TOTALITARIAN POLICE STATE, it still had problems with internal security from terrorists using  saboteur style   guerrilla warfare tactics. \"\"If we apply the  War  metaphor, we have to posit that it was either a preemptive strike or a punitive strike for something the US was about to do or had already done.  \"don\'t knowNot in any meaningful way.0\" I am disturbed that there are humans that would kill thousands of innocent lives, screw up an economy, and scare thousands of people. I have traveled before, been to Washington, and I am around the World Trade Center frequently so I am also mad that these events struck close so close to my home. I had a relative who worked in the World Trade Center and even though she made it out, I was horrified. I cannot look at the New York skyline without thinking of the attack, which makes me think of the thousands of innocent victims, and I am horrified. I think we need to find who did this by any means neccesary except for killing innocent civilians.\"I am more patriotic.0not at allNo other choicesIn the long run the USA\"The terrorist attacks were upsetting and distressing but also showed how small man is against the forces of nature. Compared to what an earthquake of some magnitude might have done (and has done in Turkey, China etc.), or the floods in Bangladesh, the loss of life was quite small.  Also I think about what happens when people are painted into a corner, when they are confronted with a superpower that appears to have all of the odds on their side and behaves in a manner that affects their outcomes. They think of ingenious ways of seeking revenge. \"\"I don\'t think my behaviors have changed.

It is unfortunate that Americans, or our government will not use this event as an opportunity for reflection and self-analysis. Rather than evaluating our role in world affairs it appears that our reaction will be no different than what we have become accustomed to; military action. I fail to see how state sanctioned violence combats the violence of others. It is a perpetuating cycle that will not end unless someone or group puts themself on the line politically and  fights  for another solution. I agree that those responsible for this action (who are not already dead) need to be dealt with, but not militarily. Do we lack that much faith in diplomacy and the world court. Justice does not equal violence!\"Retaliation for many instances of actions and sanctions against other countries and peoples.I feel they did this to get back at America.

No religion should condone mass indiscriminate slaughter.  For the terrorists to wrap themselves in the veil of religion is disgusting. The loss of life is terrible and disheartening.  Words can\'t describe the collective shock. To those who say  everything has changed,  particulary about their personal safety, I say  what planet have they been living on?  Nothing has changed.   We are no more or less safe than before 9-11.  To those who lived through the apocalyptic imminent nuclear incineration possible during the cuban missle crisis this is much less fear inducing.  Anyone who lived through the Cold War and potential mutual assured destruction phase of foreign policy is deluded or uninformed if they think anything is different now in terms of personal safety.  This is a failure of American education or a case of mass cultural blinders. I hope I\'m wrong, but I fear our leaders are also blind to the abyss they have entered in starting a hot war in Afganistan.  Throughout history that region of Central Asia has swallowed attackers.  Worse, it has resulted in the defeated invaders returning home to see their civilization self destruct in its aftermath.  Britain and Russia\'s spheres of influence policies in Central Asia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to their rabid hate for each other up to during and after WWI and WWII and directly influenced the creation of the Middle East we know today and the Cold War.  It was the failure of those policies that led to the current statelessness in Muslim countries.  With no nation with which to identify, Muslims identified first as Muslims, and their poverty, powerlessness and inability to better themselves led to radical fundamentalism.  Does anyone in our Government have any sense of history. America wins big, total wars.  We have lost every guerilla war we ever entered.  What makes anyone think this will be different.  All we are doing is guaranteeing that the state of life in Israel (terror, bombings, etc) will be the state of life here now. Sept 11 shows the spnelessness and failure of our energy policy.  Instead of pursuing alternative energy self sufficiency to allow us to be independent of oil in Asia and the Middle East we have created an addiction governing or collective behavior as insidious as the heroin from that region. The towers should be rebuilt, perhaps even bigger as an defiant response. The reflexive response of abundant display of flags and wrapping ourselves in the symbols of America is nauseating and meaningless.  Taking refuge in the flag, or group religion, is deluding ourselves and arrogant and elitist.  Militaristic bravado is what Japan had before WWII.

There is also a fear that, what little remained of true freedom in western societies is doomed.  We can abolish the right to privacy, the right to innocence until guilt is proven, the right to feel secure in our own homes because we want a level of security that is not possible to achieve.

I\'m not so much afraid to walk out of my door with my safety in jeopardy, but the safety of my family members- particuarly my sisters and my mom. Being a muslim, it is very common to see a muslim girl wear the traditional head dress, and because wearing a head dress isn\'t exactly a big fashion statement, it\'s easy to point who can be a target for a vicious backlash. I\'m the oldest of all my bothers, and second oldest among all my siblings, and worry everyday if someone will try to induce harm onto the women in my family. Especially my youngest sister, who attends a muslim school, where she is required to wear the traditional head dress everyday. I fear her safety more then I fear for my life because she is petitte, very shy and wouldn\'t be able to defend herself if someone tried to attack her. Even in my household the talk of what happened brings us to a dead silence, wondering if someone wants vengence. The day of the attack, a person who lives across the street from my house came outside his basement apartment and started to post signs saying,  No to PLO  and  Go Home Arabs , he then became boisterous and not before long engaged in a vicious verbal shouting match with my mother who tried to explain that because my family and I are arab-americans does not mean we condone what was done nor any arab american. I admit, had I seen him yelling at my mother the way she told me he was, I don\'t think I would have tried to resolve it by talking to him, but by other means.

I feel very deeply for everyone who was affected by these events, but only when I am confronted with their faces and voices directly; I don\'t dwell on the pain when I am not immediately encountering pain. I believe that we are all here to co-create our existence together--the good, the bad, and the ugly. U.S. policies throughout the world has created resentment and anger directed toward us; there is no doubt of that in my mind. Now a relatively small group of people have created anguish and outrage in the U.S. and with our allies. How very interesting. Those terrorists had as much right to create terror as we did to create beneficial economic and military policies in other countries, and we have every right to retaliate against their actions, as well. However, I guess I am in the 10\% minority of people who do not approve of the way George W. Bush has handled the situation. I agree that the U.S. cannot let such actions go unpunished, but when he got up in front of Congress and said that the reason they hate us is because they hate  freedom  and  American values , he was either lying, or just too dumb for words. If they hated freedom, why don\'t they bomb the Red-Light district in Holland, where people are much freer and heathenistic than we are? If they hate affluence, then why don\'t they bomb Switzerland, where they enjoy a higher standard of living than we do here? Why doesn\'t Osama bin Laden say,  We will kill every American, Jew, and Canadian we find ? Because that\'s ridiculous. Bin Laden and his kin have expressed their legitimate greivances to the world in a way that finally cannot be ignored by anyone, but he was forced to do it in a way that will ultimately lead to his own destruction. Once that\'s accomplished, I hope we\'ll get a president who understands that we live in a community of nations that expects to be heard when they speak to us. In the end, however, nations come and go, empires rise and fall, and the U.S. will not prove to be any different.

These moments deliniate the times before from the times after, and I am certain that times will never be the same. I regret that this is the world my children will know. Simpler times are something that we all long for - the days of  Father Knows Best  and  Andy Griffith  Simpler times and innocence are lost. We know now that we will never be safe in the same way that we know we will pay taxes. I am also angry at the perpetrators of this cowardly act of violence. While I don\'t advocate war or violence, I know that we must ensure that this will not happen again. Let those that are responsible know that these acts are not the best means to their ends.

Enough already. I can see the point of showing film or video when illustrating a point of helping people understand what happened but to use that same film of the second plane striking tower 2 over and over in the background for every new interview or new piece of information was over the top in the worst sense.  I believed it a ploy by someone to inflame the American public as much as possible. I read the special Newsweek edition today about the tragedy and cried through most of it.  Its all so terribly sad and I feel such loss as a person of this country.  To know how many thousands of moments of love have been wrenched from the lives of so many people, makes me shake my head at the willingness of men to die for such an atrocity.  Whatever their reasons none of them can justify it to me. It was hatred of America and Americans and our way of life; that is the bottom line.  These men held religious motives as the basis for their actions. So did the Nazis and every other group whose has perpretrated such horrors on humanity. They are not different.  They are just a crazy as the next bunch that allows religiosity to justify any thing no matter how horrible or how inhuman.  I have been very religious most of my life and from a personal stand point most of the worst decisions I have made came from that source; religiosity not religion.  I believe the same about these men and those who lead such men and those people who follow such leaders.  We stand at a crossroads as a nation whether to surrender our freedoms in order to be safe or whether to have freedom and all the dangers it entails.

It is a tragedy that this matter had to be brought up on the expense of 7,000 innocent people and their families that have to live with it.  \"\"I am distraught that anyone could cause such damage without our intelligence organizations being aware.  I am deeply saddened for the families of the victims, and I am angry that the incident has taken place.

Although I think those responsible have a right to be angry, what they did is pure evil.\"A network of terrorists justifiably angered by U.S. foreign policies0\"I was horrified by the attacks.  I felt profound shock and fear.  My fear was enhanced by my growing conviction that in a society such as ours, there really is no way to prevent attacks of this nature.  The risk for such tragedies comes along with a free and open society. I feel that our government\'s response so far has been simplistic, to put it mildly.  In no way will a military campaign against Afghanistan address the root causes of these actions.  On the contrary, such a campaign will fan the flames of hatred toward the U.S. and make terror in this county more likely in the future. And the planned action is one that cannot possibly achieve its objects.  Veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are screaming at us,  don\'t do it! you cannot win!   And yet still we forge ahead.\"\"My name is Bjoern and I`m studying Socialmanagement. I find this international study very interesting and important. The terrorist attacks of Sep.11.2001 are an event that will have a great effect on the whole world. A lot of people in Germany have friends and relatives in the US and visited the States for a several times. I myself have relatives in your country. My father lives in Texas, my sister in Virginia. My sister wanted to come over to Germany again after two years last week but she stayed at home because she had to fly from Washington D.C. and would have had bad feelings sitting in an airplane only five days after the attacks. I deeply hope that the United States and the other NATO members (Germany as well) will not start a war which will leed to more terror attacks all over the Western World. You cannot answer terror with terror! The best example is the conflict between Isreal and the Palestinians. These fundamentalists have such a great ideology that you cannot defeat with violence. You can compare their goals with the goals of Hitler-Germany. But the big differences are, a) that there is not only one country, and b) there are no military aims, to fight against. In Germany the government is changing a number of laws to have greater oppertunities to get controll over some extreme islamistic groups in our country. Our constitution is based on, just like in the US, personal and religious freedom, which is good. A great fear although is that some islamistic groups unify each other under the protection of our constitution to support Osama Bin Laden and other terrorists with financial help. There is a big discution in our parliament how far these law changes can go without dicriminating moslem groups. I do not have an answer for all these questions or appropriate alternatives to the upcoming strikes against Afghanistan and other possible  enimies . But I do hope that we all are not standing infront of a new great war. We had enough wars in the last 100 years!

Why must the US plead with them to cooperate with our efforts to apprehend and punish only the truly guilty? They won\'t because, in truth, the  overwhelming majority  of the followers of Islam are giddy with delight that the USA has finally been slapped; for our support of Israel, for the Gulf War, for the globalization of our decadence.. Here is the sad truth about our future. We are at war. Not with simply the terrorists willing to die to kill Americans but with the networks of the tens of millions of Muslims who support them in any way...and I mean even those that  support them with only their prayers. This is a war against an enemy whose religion would approve  SLICING OPEN THE THROATS OF INNOCENT WOMEN WITH BOX CUTTERS.

When I was wathing the news, I saw the terrorist countrey celebrating over the even. This made me extreamly mad. I couldn\'t believe people would celebrate over deaths, regardless of what countrey it happened in, I just hope that this situation does not get worse, I don\'t want to see war, and i don\'t want to see anymore deaths...\"I think I have become more aware of my surroundings in way that bad things can happen no matter where you are.I think other countries want to try and weaken the US. Islamics\"This is very tough, but I feel I may have something important to say here.  Let me say right up front that I do not condone what happened on 9/11.  It was a truely horrible event and a complete tragedy.  I say this up front because it worries me that people will misunderstand the rest of what I have to say, thinking that I condone the attacks on New York and Washington.  That could not be further from the case. After the initial shock wore off, I found myself asking the question,  Why did this happen?   Why do the middle eastern people hate us so badly that they would do such a thing, and that in certain places there was dancing in the streets afterwords?  To say that it is because we are the defenders of freedom, or that it is because they are jealous of our affluence, or that it is because their religion tells them to hate our way of life, is a gross oversimplification and perhaps even completely wrong. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because we funded the Jewish take over of the area formerly known as Palestine (now known as Isreal).  Palestinians had been living there for 2,000 years after the Jews originally left of their own volition.  It was/is an area Muslims consider sacred.  How many Palestinians have died over the last ten years as they fight to keep what is rightfully theirs?  More than the 5,000 Americans that died last week for sure. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because American oil companies took amazing advantage Middle Eastern countries until they wized up, kicked us out and formed OPEC. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because first we created Iraq\'s military to fight Iran, and then later bombed the shit out of that very same military. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because as comedian George Karlin puts it,  We seem to think it\'s okay to bomb brown people.  One phrase keeps going through my mind,  The chickens have come home to roost.   We trained bin Laden how to be a terrorist to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.  How ironinc he now use those skills against us. We as Americans don\'t know what it\'s like to not be American.  I suspect it sucks to be on the other side of that equation.  I believe it is time for Americans to take a good strong look in the mirror.

Could be bin Laden, but government may just be searching for a fall guy.\"noneSee my lengthy comments on the first page adressing exactly this.\"first attacker, second us government\"i am who i have been00Dont knowMartyrdom. The beleif that god is on their side.\"At first I couldn\'t believe what had happened. I had just flown back from visiting a friend in france (1 hour flight), and after collecting my luggage I bought a drink from a shop in the airport, one shop assistant was telling the other about a plane crash that had brought down the twin towers. I thought it was just \'airport talk\', whilst waiting for a connecting bus I heard some other folks chatting about it, and began to realise that something big had happened. My immediate reaction was that of personal mourning, though I couldn\'t explain why, as I have no personal connection to any folks there. Because I was on my own at the time I had nothing to distract me from thinking about it, once on the bus the radio went on and the we all listened to the news. Soon though people began to chat with each other and the news effectively became background music. At the time this frustrated me cause I thought that the least people could do is listen, out of courtesy. But when my family met me at the other end of my bus journey, I became aware that there is nothing that I could do to change what has happened, and listening to the news does not change anything. Thus I just had to move on, carry on as normal and not act any different. It was just so hard to know what to feel at that time. I met with my friend soon after getting home, the first thing she said was \'fucking pakis man, I told you they are fucked up do you believe me now\' she is an Indian girl who has always had a bad opinion of muslims. It just made me realise how hard it is to hold an independent thought about such events, everyone has their own interpretation, and yet all that really exists is rhetoric. I have tried see what postives can be learned, but a neccessary part of this is to empathise with both the attacker and the attacked, and of course it is taboo not to instantly condem everything the \'other side\' did. All you can do is think global, act local.  I don\'t live in fear, and the events have not caused me excessive anxiety. life is too short.             \"\"None.

Fervent hope that there will  not be a spike in irrational acts of reprisal toward anyone in this  country who  appears  to have Arabic nationality or any other ethnic identity that ignorant goons would use to  justify  their own violence.

'0osama bin ladennonefor attentionIslamic fundamentalistsThey believe they are doing the work of GodNotice potential for peril more in daily life\"One thought I have had recently is that Americans are now forced to root for the Big Guy. In many movies, TV shows, novels, etc. the hero is often a loner who is misunderstood by authority (Dirty Harry, Die Hard) or at the very least, outmanned and forced to improvise and use his wits (James Bond, MacGuyver).  We root for that person, knowing the odds are against him but he will somehow triumph.  In sports, too, some of our most cherished national stories and mythology are about David beating Goliath (US defeat of Russian hockey team, Miracle Mets). We are now faced with being unable to play that role.  Who as children wanted to be the Japs or the Nazis?   We all wanted to be the brave guys trapped in The Bulge or the few holding out in the Philippines.  It is only fun being the Big Guy if you get to be the cavalry coming to the rescue.  Was it really enjoyable to watch the US crush the rest of the world in Olympic basketball? Our new role as Goliath, faced with a David  we would applaud under other circumstances for his grit, determination, preparation, resourcefulness and bravery, leaves us with cold comfort.\"noneterroristshatredMy immediate response was shock and disbelief.  My lingering response is sadness for the loss of life and regret that the feeling of security of US citizens has been fundamentally changed.\"Well, I\'ve been living in the United States for only 2 months, and the attack happened one month ago.  When I heard of the attack I felt shocked,  I knew about it because my parents called me that morning.  I was really afraid of what may happen after that.  I\'ve never seen before a war so close to me.  And I\'ve noticed that american people know how to manage this kind of situations.  I\'m really thinking about going back to MExico, i don\' want to be involved in situations like this, being an exchange student is by itself difficult, now being an exchange student in a country that it\'s in a war it\'s even more difficult.  I had a nightmare the other night related to this issue, and that really makes me think about the stress that a lot of american people must be suffering.\"\"I might have changed, but I really can\'t tell.

Where I am from, we were taught a lot about pride. In sports especially we were taught to lay it all out in the name of our school, town, and for the good of our teammates. Voting rates are low, ghettos have been formed to distinguish different types of people, and there are less and less rally\'s evident, fighting for what is right. It seems to me that this country as a whole has lost the pride that has made it so strong. People are constantly complaining about things that are wrong, whether it be nation wide or as small scale as on this campus. Never, however, have I seen anything done about it. The closest thing I have seen that resembled any kind of activist movement was a certain Rev. starving himself to stop an unjust military operation. Why have we stopped wanting to improve this country?  The founders of our country developed certain documents, outlining the way that life should be lead in the country they bid their lives to win. IN their genius, though, they did not neglect to realize that things must change with the passage of time and formation of changing societies. In this way, the left the actual designing of morals, and standards by which we live up to each passing generation. What happens when we stop caring about the country and the changes that need to be made? We are rudely awaken by foreign evils.  Perhaps this was the right thing to happen to this country at a time in our world that we are so bored and unmotivate, that trials of celebrities end marriages, and ships and islands full of horny men and women become top priorities. Perhaps we have been brought to realize that we have been neglecting the glory of this country, and that it is time to be proud again. Thousands of men and women have died to produce and protect the freedom that we are handed to us at birth. It is our responsiblity to keep this jewel we are given well protected and polished. That should be our norm.  To answer the question  Should we go back to be Normal?  I think if we look back to the way things once were in this country; so full of pride, we would realize that in fact we are already there. This country has a tradition of Pride, and of love between the fellow men as outlined in the words of our forefathers.  Go back to being normal!?  We are already there.  \"I don\'t know and will not assumeNot at all.\"It was obviously incredibly shocking when it happened last Tuesday, but to me, the emotion and reality of it was almost overpowered by the world\'s, and the authorities\', rushed reaction to it. No sooner than those men flew into the WTC, their names were up on the screen for the world to see, their names made known even before many of the innocent victims of their actions. Since they gave their own lives for this evil act, I felt that revealing their names was giving them the only thing that they had to gain from doing this thing: notoreity. The media were quick to assemble their repeat logos and footage of the crash which they showed around the clock - not as a reminder, more as a jingle. The president spread fear - harmless fear among the rest of the world, but dangerous fear to those countries neighbouring Afghanistan. He foolishly threatened to kill more innocents, and, astonishingly, people (the polls say) were eventually swung to agree with him (probably by the media). Though I am as saddened as anybody, and shocked more than any time in my life, by what happened on 9/11, the emotion I feel most about not just the day itself but its continuing aftermath, is despair in mankind. Many times in the last 7 days, I\'ve felt incredibly ashamed to be human.\"The World - anyone pointing the finger anywhere else is being as single-minded as whoever they think they\'re pointing at.Even more despaired.It unfortunately happens.\"My intial reaction to the events of 9/11 was one of denial and disbelief.  This quickly gave way to anger and a feeling of personal violation.  As I have inspected myself and watched the rhetoric of the politics involved I now find myself wondering what the eventual outcome of this will be, and feeling that our  new war  may well lead us into an atmosphere of fear and anxiety about the future, which was exactly the desired psychological affect of the terrorists in the first place. There also remains a residual feeling of violation and anger although I am able to deal with this much more effectively as time passes.\"The only behavior that I am aware of is that I think that I am processing more of my feelings about people in general and this has translated into more outward display of emotion such as anger and discussion of feeling about the event.\"See above.  Basically because they have somehow convinced themselves that theirs is the morally superior path and that they have rationalized their actions, through this belief.\"\"Although the intial evidence points to Bin Laden, et.al. I think the real responsibility is with all of us.  Due to media coverage and desensitization to war, we, as a nation, and to some degree, the world,  have become apathetic to what really goes on around us in terms of international events and focus.  Perhaps it all boils down to a lack of personal responsibility and our concepts of whether Evil really exists as an entity in the world. \"\"The attack changed life in the US forever and has shattered the illusion that we have held for many years that we were immune to terrorist atrocities in our country. I don\'t believe that this is an isolated incident and we will see more in the weeks/months/years to come. The terrorists proved that sophisticated weapons are not necessary to cause mass destruction in our open and vulnerable society. There have already been outcries that our civil liberties are at risk, but I, for one, am willing to put up with substantial security measures if they will help to combat terrorism here. While it will be impossible to protect against all future terrorist attacks, it is important for our government to do whatever can be done to provide a measure of safety for its citizens. I believe that the evnts of 9/11 will have a lasting and negative effect on the USA.  \"Anger over US policy in the mideast. Anger over the president\'s recent foreign policy decisions.

'\"The terrorists themselves are directly responsible, but those who indoctrinated them into a violent form of Islam are even more responsible. The U.S. government is more distally responsible due to its meddling in the affairs of other countries.\"\"My initial reaction on the day this happened was shock, disbelief, and confusion. I just could not believe that this could happen. I felt some anger towards the perpetrators,  but not nearly the amount of anger expressed by people around me, who were demanding  that we begin retaliation immediately. I felt some sympathy and sadness for those who  lost family and friends and for people who worked or lived in Manhatten and felt so  violated. Over the next week or so, I kept trying to figure out why this would happen  and how we might best respond to prevent things like this from happening again. I spent  hours on the Internet, reading what others were saying about the causes of the tragedy  and what we should do in response. I continued to feel confused and numb, not knowing  what to do. The only thing I thought I knew was something we shouldn\'t do, which would  be to immediately launch a counter-attack that could escalate into a war. I offered a  few posts of my own on message boards, suggesting it might be wise to use restraint.  Nobody responded. I noticed that people were really caught up in trying to demonstrate  that they had the best analysis of the situation and the best solutions. Some people were  beginning to attack each other\'s ideas as stupid or immoral. I began feeling more hopeless  and depressed. I finally posted a message on a board, basically stating that even if  someone on the discussion list presented the absolutely best analysis and solution for  this problem, what would be the point, because the White House did not subscribe to this  discussion list. That essentially stopped the discussion, which soon turned back to the  topics the list was supposed to discuss. But one last comment made me really sad. It came  from a woman from California who said she wondered whether her 4-year daughter would live  to adulthood, and said that an anonymous stalker was sending her threatening emails in  response to a previous post she wrote, suggesting that U.S. foreign policy is partly to  blame for the attacks. More feelings of hopelessness. I thought about my oldest son in  college, who is in the age group that would be drafted first if it came to that. I thought  about my second son, in his senior year in high school, who would become eligible for  the draft next year. I thought about my draft number, 157, just high enough to keep me  out of the stinking Viet Nam war. I heard President Bush say that this battle could go  on and on for years. Just like Viet Nam. If this goes on that long, I thought, my 12- and 14-year-old sons could become draft eligible before this is over. At that point, almost  two weeks after 9-11, I cried for the first time. I felt sad for the people of New York  when the WTC was destroyed, but I feel dread and horror about another Viet Nam-type conflict  that could be even worse because of continued terrorist reprisals. \"\"I watch the news on TV as soon as I wake up, at 6:30, and before I go to bed. For years prior to this I have only read newspapers for the news.\"The terrorists themselves saw this as a fulfillment of a high calling to preserve their religion and culture. The leaders behind this are motivated by a need for power and a hatred for those who have tried to Westernize the eastern world.\"I have become a news junkie, and started to share my mad theories about 3rd world war, which now can become true. Remember that  I foresaid it!\"\"Because they value most their ideals than their life. If someone doesn\'t respect his own life, who would he  think about other\'s life. Specially if he despises them?\"\"I believe that islamic terrorism acts won\'t stop at that. Radical  islamists*, have a new weapon we have no defence against. We have no means to stop someone who is ready to kill himself to achieve his goal. I always believed that if there was ever gonna be a third world war it would be ironic, because it would really be a war between the 3rd  and the 1st world, led by emergent muslim nations. Their military power is  far behind that of the western world, but they have devised a cheap and  deadly weapon. And they really want to expand their territory, they have  already started in Serbia and former URSS republics. And this is  unstoppable, because it\'s not a decision of some islamic government, it\'s their people\'s will. At the start of the imminent conflict, most muslim  governments that are supporting US, would find themselves in a state of  near civil war, and if they cease their support to the US and give some economic or military support to Afghanistan, for example, to stop  the onset of a civil war US would fight them mercilessly. So they are in  a  cul de sac . I really think that a war would rage across the world as a consequence  of the attack on NY. American attitude won\'t help to calm things down. I think you are more hurt in your pride than for the horrible life loss. Watching the news, I sometimes think that you\'d be more angry if the White  House was destroyed instead of the WTC, despite the fact that there would  be much less people killed. Sorry about this, but it\'s the impression you give.   On the other hand, I think Israel would try to make profit of this, and  that can mean their end and another reason for the historical hatred against jews. In any case, I always believed that Sharon would bring war across the middle east one way or the other. In fact, the current crisis is more a result of US support to Israel than a result of its global politics And this war would be different to all we\'ve known before. Islamic nations would use their poor armies to defend themselves against the conventional attacks form the US. As the war gets stuck, US would start to use nuclear weapons, but we might never know this. In Europe and America, war would be different, it would be a terrorism war. Many muslims in our countries would sacrifice themselves for the Jihad, even if they don\'t belong to Al Qaeda or such organizations, just for being heroes and for the promise of going to Heaven. The situation is even worse in Europe, because we have muslim nations that  all around and it will be very easy for the terrorist cells to get into EU, just consider Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia inside Europe, not to say Northern  Africa. In Spain we have a great flood of immigants from Morocco that  come in little boats called  pateras  across the Gibraltar strait.  Apart from smuggling all these illegal immigrants and loads of  cannabis, what else can bring these  pateras ? Russia will also suffer a lot. In fact, it seems they\'ve been  suffering for a long time in Chechnya.  *(in fact, from our point of view, we could consider the  beliefs of every muslim as radical. Their culture is much more  ethnocentric and their concepts of justice and religion are far more  drastic than those of the western culture)  \"Radical Islamism did it. Israel and the US have some  responsability themselves.\"i worry about more attacks. i sleep worse, have more nightmares about living through a war on US soil. i am even more rabid about responding to racist remarks and attributions for guilt that are unfounded and racist. i feel less patriotic (is that possible?) in someways (i cringe to see all these american flags everywhere), but feel more american than i have in a long time (this is how i am perceived by other nationals who don\'t know my critical stance on america). i haven\'t felt this american since i lived overseas... i think twice before drinking water from the tap. and i wait anxiously for the next bit of bad news...\"\"sad to admit, but i think much is attributable to America\'s global economic and political actions and attitudes\"because they see it as an affront to the American system (political and economic) and the ways we live our lives\"i mourn the loss of human lives, i mourn the (false?) sense of security i had in my own country. at the same time, i know that our nation\'s economic and political policies have made us a target for a long time now, and i am not surprised it happened. for a long time, i suspected a conspiracy somewhere within our government, as someway of unifying the very split population and putting them behind a president that many did not have faith in... i still wonder if/where the conspiracy lies... i am very sad this happened, but can\'t help but thinking that we had something this horrendous coming to us... we\'ve not been the models of democracy that we tout ourselves to be; i was hoping this would help illuminate our hypocrisy in many domains, but instead the media and much of the population seems to be even more riled up under the flag, painting us as the land of The Good and The Free, when so many don\'t want to realize that we\'ve been neither good nor free since our nation\'s inception. i deeply fear that this will take over partisan politics, which were already ignoring the needs of a huge percentage of our nations citizens and residents. i mourn the violent repercussions we\'re taking on countless innocent civilians in Afganistan... countless because the repercussions will continue long after we (attempt to?) obliterate who we perceive to be our enemy. i fear the way this has changed geopolitics for the next 20 years, and the future beyond that. i am frightened that this could cause more complications to a world full of racism and classism... these are just a few snapshots from my perspective...\"I haven\'t a clue.

My second thought was sadness and horror. Now, I am afraid that events will escalate. I hope that the response of the united states will be based on the democratic and justice princibles that I believe in. One is innocent until proven guilty and not the other way around. I also hope that Bush will not lower himself to the standard of those who committed the crime.

I am more proud to wear the badge of honor of being an American. \"Terrorists with the monetary and strategic help of Osama bin Laden - with tacit (and perhpas financial) support from States with sympathies for bin Laden.\"Those who did this have, no doubt, grown up in dire poverty - and have developed pathological inferiority complexes. Though they have been funded in their exercise, they still know the pains of privation from early childhood - and are convinced from day 1 that the USA is responsible for not only their lot in life, but the pains of their friends and loved ones This blind rage developed in childhood, coupled with \'convenient\' misinterpreataion of the Koran, have served to promote their \'mission\'. This people are on the fringes of religious zealots, but they main problem is a deeply-rooted pyschological disturbance. \"\"This is nothing more than mass murder of innocent people.  There are no demands, reasonable or otherwise, by the perpetrators; there is not even a claim of responsibility so far. The atrocities are not politically-motiviated, only hatred-motivated. In response, the USA and its supporters must keep a cool head to seek out only those who are directly/indirectly responsibile, and must maintain the \'moral highground\' in the way they respond, lest they be criticized by other nations who already feel the perpetrators had a legitimate beef with US foreign policy. An unmeasured response would play right into their hands, and feed the anti-American frenzy. It annoys me how overplayed the \'hatred of America\' angle has been played - esp. as living in the UK has exposed me to many points of view that Americans aren\'t hearing as much. I am not as \'angry\' as I am \'depressed\' and sickened that so many innocent people have lost their lives. Whether their deaths are avenged with a successful response is immaterial. They are dead - and in a way, the perpetrators have had a victory already. The entire episode has made me very homesick - and made me love and respect my fellow Americans all the more. \"Islamic fundamentalists with the backing of anti-Western groups including possibly fascist and other totalitarian organizations throughout the world. See response on first page.\"America and the  Western World,  the free market system that they propagate and the corporate entities that they  harbor  continue to do battle with the other economic systems and societies of the world.  Because of advances in applied technologies over the past 30 years, the West\'s  terrorists  (the Global 2000) have sufficiently penetrated the economies and civilizations of Islam (and other non-Western societies) with Coca-Cola, Marlboro cigarettes and Mickey Mouse.  On September 11th, we experienced the initial attack, in surely what will be a series of retributions against the Western marketing system for its assault on fundamental Islam (and other non-Western societies.)  The same technology that has enabled the rapid dissemination of this way of life on these societies is being used by these societies (through fringe, militant terrorist organizations) to turn the free market on itself.      The role of government in a free market is to preserve the marketplace, which is precisely what the governments of the US, NATO countries and its allies must do.   But, we have reached a crossroads in western civilization.  Rather than succumbing to these terrorist threats, the US and its allies must take the moral high ground.  We cannot fall victim to these attacks by losing our personal freedoms in the process; creating an overtly controlled society is tantamount to tyranny.  Nor, can we respond in a knee-jerk show of military mite.  If we did either, the terrorists could declare victory now.   To sit by idly would be equally reprehensible.  The only sensible course of action will be either to isolate the Western world from other societies (difficult with our dependence on their raw materials and emerging markets) or begin a vigilant attack on the basic ideologies espoused by these fringe groups.  I believe this course of action enables the preservation of our marketplace, while systematically, if slowly, disassembling this anti-free world movement.    This war will have many battlefields, from Internet chat rooms and spin doctors\' laptops, to the Swiss bank accounts of the wealthy backers of this terrorism, not to mention the treacherous landscapes of Afghanistan and neighboring anarchies.  These battles will be fought at a high cost to both sides.   The loss of humanity, opportunity and capital will be great, but not as great as these costs will be if we fail to act, or act imprudently. Unlike most wars, this one has no beginning or end.  It has been fought for thousands of years.  Humans are competitive - greed is an innate human condition:  Greed for power, for money, for love and for life.  In the end, I believe that our Western civilization is the worst socio-economic system on earth, except for all others.  Until someone betters our system, it will win over would-be fascist, communist or this latest totalitarian form of rule championed by these Islamic fundamentalists, but secretly supported by many others as well.   I am proud to be an American - God bless the USA.                  \"\"I believe changing one\'s personal behavior because of these attacks is admitting defeat by the terrorists.  I have already traveled by commercial aircraft since September 11th.  However, I am running my business in a very cautious manner, given the future economic uncertainties. \"I feel a great deal of hate for the actions that took place on September 11th 2001.  I believe that is was also bound to happen when you are on top like the United States is people are always trying to better you and take you down that is obviously what these terrorists intended to do but they did not succeed it takes alot more to ruin a country as strong as the U.S.  I feel that we should go to war and make everybody who was involved in this suffer greatly we can\'t hold back we do it to often.  I personally would go to war in a second and would have no second thoughts.

He was one of 50-some children and his father died when he was 10. For some it is probably a release of sexual frustration, living in such a repressive society.  Also, some plain old ENVY of America and the need to have a scapegoat to blame for one\'s own dismal existence.  That\'s my profound psychological analysis. \"Probably Bin Laden and other similar organizations working together.I lock my car door while driving around Riyadh. I choose my airlines more carefully now.  I am paying more attention to how Saudis are reacting to me as an American in their presence.\"It is very scary in its efficiency. From a personal point of view, it is certainly a travesty of human life.  Not to sound sick, but I teach art and from an artistic, visual point of view, the demolition of the two towers was almost  beautiful  and poetic in its graceful demise. That of course is greatly overshadowed by the horrendous thought that innocent women and children were used as missiles against ourselves.   I think much of the world has tried to have it both ways for too long -- reaping the benefits of the US while heaping abuse upon it.  The US can rightly be blamed for turning a blind eye to Israel\'s excesses (the no.1 cause of all this hatred against us), but much of the Muslim world has a double standard about the definition of terrorism.  Palestine seems to be the darling of the world these days (by Muslims and non-Muslims alike) but their terrorist activities are equal to that of Israel. As for America, the  new world disorder  makes the 90\'s look like the 50\'s used to look.  The 50\'s nowadays seem almost utopian in retrospect.  The only good that has come of this event is that it has allowed us to glimpse the future, and like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, we have a chance to change it. \"',4,-5,0,2,5,1.8,3,0,0,0,0,0.6,1.8,1.2,0,1.2,0,12.61,0.6,0,0,0,0,1.2,1.2,0,0.6,0,0,0.6,0,5.4,2.4,0,1.8,2.4,0.6,0,0.3,6.6,0,0,0,1.2,0.6,0,1.2,0,41.42,0,1.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,49.52,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,15.01,8.1,1.2,1.2,0,0,6.01,0,0.6,0.6,0,0,0,0,0.6,0.6,0,0.6,Male

It became very real to me - and embodied as fear and shock - though the effects were not felt until a few days later.  I had a major gastric upset, which stopped me sleeping. I was majorly worried that someone as apparently stupid as Bush would over-react in a macho aggressive way.  I was impressed that he did not - at leat until now.  Blair\'s positioning is something I\'m not sure how I feel about. I find the cynical attempt at humanitarian aid a distasteful gesture. But I\'m worried also what will happen afterwards.  The tribes seem to behave in utterly atrocious ways.  The treatment of women is obscene. It\'s amazing seeing panic in people too.  It\'s odd how contacgious it can seem - I\'m glad that I\'m aware of that. \"\"My initial reaction was thrill at such wonderful explosions and grudging respect for the audacity with which the attacks were carried out, followed by horror and sickness at the destruction and loss of life, with a considerable measure of accompanying guilt. Since then I have become more and more withdrawn from the jingoism and totalitarianism that have permeated the media and public life.  It seems that every gathering becomes a rally; every conversation or e-mail exchange an exhortation.  Emotions are raw too.  I\'ve hear and read many confessionals lately and here I am participating in one! As to the patriotic breast-beating, sure I\'m a loyal American, but I believe in keeping it in my heart, not wearing it on my sleeve.  As I have for many years (and wars) I will support our government when it\'s right and oppose it when it isn\'t. This time has brought out both the best and worst of this country; our cooperativeness and generosity on the one hand, the deeply ingrained racism ( as American as apple pie ) and militarism on the other.

It may wake the Unites States out of its smug complacency, sense of invulnerability, and feelings of superiority. I personally was not touched in that no one I  knew died, but I still felt glum and depressed for about 2 weeks. These feelings were broken by brief periods of anger and shame at how some Americans were reacting with  statements like \'nuke the arabs\' or even calling the terrorist\'s acts the most evil act done.  This pales to the Holocaust. My feelings for Americans have become more negative because they still don\'t get it-- that much of the rest of the world does hate us, and that we deserve to be hated by some people. But I also feel increased prejudice towards Arabs who believe crazy ideas like the  Jews did it. I knew there were fanatics in Arab lands, but I was surprised at how educated Arabs could hold such views. I still have a hard time imagining what it must be like at ground zero. Despite the media coverage (which was graphic, scarey, and vivid), people who have been there  say it doesn\'t really capture the magnitude of the event. Americans have been traumatized, and I fear we will react in the wrong way and not learn from the incident.\"Because it is the only way they can effect the changes they want and because they hate AmericansI watch the news more.

The upside I see is the tremendous good that has come from this tragedy .  The profound degree of heroism, unity, and outpouring of love not only around the country, but the world, is striking.  It saddens me that it takes this level of disaster to spur this level of benevolence into the world sometimes!   More than anything I am now most concerned with our country\'s response.  I very much hope that it is done with responsibility and intelligence...not reactive anger.  This is not the time to be impulsive in our quest for a scapegoat to explain away the unexplainable!

And terrorist used our own planes.  But I really felt sorry for all the People that lost their live from this.  As the day went on, I learned more on how things went and the video tape that the news showed. It still shocked me and surprise on how long the building where standing. As George W. Bush gave his speach I felt better, that we(as a country) would take this lightly. If Gore was pers. I don\'t want to know what he would do. At the end of the day, I still could believe the news, but there it was.... But I thank God that most of the people made it out alive. I first thought that 20,000 at least would have deid in those buildings.  Then to find out that less than 6,000 died. Made me feel better. When they had people on the new telling people that they lost a Husband/wife. That is not what made almost cry; it was what they did.  They called their loved one to say good bye, that did. That day I had all mixed emotions: Mad, Hate, sad, shocked. I dont feel that we need more security in the airports, just better people watching out for someone that look like they going to do something that will kill a lot of people.

My other profounf feeling is that I feel the latent racism that is arising in the society.

In the same way, I have been greatly saddened and frightened by the reactions of our government in response to the attacks.  I fear that innocent people around the world will become victims of the US war machine, like so many others in the past.

I just cannot believe that it\'s all real.  I can\'t believe that in the matter of minutes, thousands of people lost their lives to a tragic end!  My mom has been ill with Cancer almost all of my life, so I\'ve never had the luxury of taking her for granted, like most people do.  These events have made it even more apparent for me just how easily and how fast our loved ones can be taken away from us.  One minute they can be here, then next minute they\'re gone!  More than ever, I just want to be with my family (my mom) right now.  I just want my mom to hold me and let me know that everything\'s going to be alright.  Unfortunately, at the moment it\'s not possible.  Because of this, I\'ve been depressed the past week.  I go to college away from home, so I can\'t be with my family or loved ones.  I even called my ex-boyfriend, who\'s working in Japan, and I cried to him, telling him how much I miss him and my family, and how lonely I feel for them!  It was kind of an unexpected moment, but letting it out helped me.  He\'s always been good at that.  For Thanksgiving, I was planning on flying home to see my mom, but now she wants me to drive instead, but the drive\'s almost 15 hours!  I still plan on flying.  I\'m not going to let this terrible tragedy keep me from a normal life, even flying home to see my family! If anything, it\'s made me feel more proud to be an American.  In other countries, when things like this happen, riots and more violence follow, but here in the US it seems like we just bonded together and are now doing whatever is possible to console those who lost their loved ones.  Like I said, every time I see the ruins of the attack, or even if I see a US flag, I get choked up, and a tear escapes.  It\'s an unbelievable thing that\'s happened, and from what I hear, it\'s not nearly over.  I keep hearing rumors of a third world war and it scares the hell out of me, but we have to seek justice.  One thing that really pisses me off are those US religious  leaders  who are pointing fingers at certain groups within our country, blaming them for what happened last Tuesday.  In a time when we need desperately to band together and help each other out, those blasphemous bastards are wedging their way in and trying to take political advantage of the situation.  For them to say that God let this happen because we deserved it just appalls me!  It makes me ashamed to be associated with them.  They\'re the antithesis of what Christian leaders should be!  No country deserves what happened to us, and God would not let this happen.  This was a horrible act by horrible people in an attempt to deface us, but I believe it won\'t work.  We can\'t let them think they knocked us down.  We\'ll have to be like one of those heroes in the action movie:  wipe the blood from our mouth, smile at our opponent, then kick his ass!  \"\"I was completely shocked by the scale and method of the attacks on New york and Washington. I have every sympathy with the families of those killed or injured in the attacks. I am concerned that the inevitable military response from the USA will potentially make future attacks more likely if they are not part of a measured approach. While a world wide campaign targetted against terrorism is to be applauded, the political leaders of the USA have to realise that their policies of the past have contributed to their demonisation in certain quarters of the World community. \"Islamic extremists00\"I actually don\'t have too much in the way of thoughts on the events of 9/11.  Although I have not isolated myself from the incident and it\'s reporting, I try not to get too caught up in all of what is happening and what is being reported about it.  I feel that the more I focus on the issue, the larger it becomes in my personal reality and that is something I wish to avoid.  I don\'t feel I know the answers around the situation, and feel in the end, the ultimate reality, it is all part of a great evolutionary process and will proceed as it does with or without my particpation.\"Not much.Mankind.Everytbody does what they think is right given the circmstances of their situation.Religious fanatics.\"hate, need for revenge, religious teachings\"\"It is a disaster caused by some deranged religious nuts.

'they are determined to send a message about the evils of capitalism and the USAI have prayed for our leaders more and have kept more informed of world events.  It makes me cherish the life I have more and it\'s brevity.\"a terrorist group, possibly Osamma bin Laden\"\"The events that unfolded on Tuesday, September llth were truly horrific.  I still can\'t fathom the images on the TV screen as being real images from our very own New York.  I am still not sure the whole magnitude of the situation has sunk in.  I am pround of myself though.  I have not become scared or angry like many people have.  I don\'t hate Arabs.  I am not afraid of Muslims.  I don\'t want to go over to Afganistan and  kill all the towel-heads.   All I want is justice for those responsible.  We should find those responsible and lock them away from humanity.  I don\'t believe in the death penalty.  I believe God will punish them in His perfect time.  I don\'t want to go to war.  We should find the most peaceful solution we can.  I believe that God let this whole event happen to give us a wake up call.  I believe God is in control, and he did let this happen instead of totally stopping it.  But, it is important to understand that God did not cause this to happen.  God does not cause evil.  God gives humans the ability to make choices, both good and evil.  This event is a choice of evil.  But, I believe God has used this event powerfully.  Never before have I seen people draw together so strongly.  The way people banded together to help with financial aid, blood drives, and volunteer service has been awe inspiring.  And the way God has drawn his people into prayer and community has been momentous.  I pray that it wouldn\'t take another event such as this to make people realize that we should be  one nation under God  with all due respect and making Him the senter of our lives.\"Bin Laden and his terriost network\"hatred, jealousy, and fear\"have not really changed\"Well, what happen on September eleventh was truly the worst attack on american ever.  I felt sorry like every other American.  But I didn\'t let the terrible attack get the best of me.  Many life will forever be changed.     \"\"Some have become more prejudice, others freightened for their lives, I have just become more aware of my surroundings\"\"I couldn\'t really say...if taken from a  not keeping up with this  T.V. news  perspective, it could be an international incident or it could be someone here.\"\"What makes a human being?  Well I feel that trust, respect, choice, rights as an individual, caring, compassion, understanding are just some of the aspects as to why life as a human being exists.          When I heard about the news last Thursday that planes were crashed into various important buildings...it was hearsay and that is all I knew at that point.  Soon I began to see people cluttering around televisions and rushing for newspapers all over campus, so I did the same. As soon as I heard about this tragedy I asked why just as many have.  A few of the inquiries that came to mind: Why is this a means to an end?   Why must higher powers always take innocent lives for granted for personal gain?  Why would anyone that decides to terrorize a country be considered a human being?  I could go on but the list is just too long and I don\'t have the time to write it all out.  I am sure that the public does not  need a reason to think about the pain any longer.        I find this world to be quite amazing in how beautiful it is, how unique it is, in what has been created.  That is only part of the good side,  however there also can be a lengthy bad side.  Our world has much misunderstanding and prejudice, we take for granted what we have in how we choose to live our lives, we destroy the earth, we are built on money and power, we have weapons that most cannot even begin to imagine.  What does this tell you  about how this world goes around?  Does this mean that humankind was a cruel joke played on the earth by god? No, of course not but our right to choice (which is not at all  bad do not get me wrong) just makes it so much harder to find the reason and meaning behind life.  We will never really find out why we are on this planet and that is why I feel there is a good and a bad.        The bad in life has been witnessed by all last week when thousands of INNOCENT lives were taken in an act of terrorism.  The good came along when we did not let this tragedy bring us down, we only came closer together and helped each other out.  Yet again there is another bad side, why not fight fire with fire and   declare war on terrorism  as the president says and risk more innocent lives.  The good side again is that we are a strong country and we will make it through this, yet  the bad side to that is that fighting in some way or another is the only way to settle the tension of a hostile country or group whichever.  It just goes to show that  with the good always comes the bad...we were a mighty country with a mighty army that kept peace on our native soil, but then international terrorism on a large scale  came through the barrier in a fit of rage, but we came together and pulled through this faster than our enemies thought we would.  The next decision could be war that may end in peace or it may not.  Lives will end and suffer and countries could end in ruin.  This is where I choose to stop talking about the incident because it makes me sick!        What is the point of all this?  Why is this a means to an end?  Must more innocent lives end in order to declare peace?  This is the problem, right here, in the  beginning of this paragraph....too many questions, not even close to enough answers. I cannot go on with my perspective as the pain is all too consuming. One last thing though:      -It is in our nature to kill ourselves, and we certainly live off of instinct.     \"\"Why is the question, and in reference to my previous perspective, I have no idea why\"Al QuaedaMy behaviors have not really changed.\"September 11th began like any other Tuesday morning; the sun came up, I was headed to class, but something was different. I first heard about the planes hitting the WTC towers on my way to my first class, then in the middle of that class we were informed that classes would be cancelled for the rest of the day. We had a campus meeting afterwards, and I had more than a few people cry on my shoulder. I was one of the people least affected by this attack, as I did not lose anyone I knew in the attack. I was also one of the people who had been saying for years that it was just a metter of time before the U.S. was hit by someone. I just had no idea that when the attack came it would be anything as big as the events of Sept. 11th. My initial reaction was one of intense fury that anyone would dare stoop to such levels to kill my fellow citizens. I wanted the people responsible hunted down and punished. Looks like I got my wish. I support the actions our president has taken thus far, but my heart goes out to the Afghani people who, through no fault of their own have been thrust between a rock and a hard place. If they try to leave the Taliban will shoot them. If they stay, American bombs will be exploding all around them. In the end I guess I feel like war on terrorists is a good thing, especially after the events of Sept. 11th, and I feel a sense of satisfaction that we are tracking down and smoking out the perpetrators of this attack. \"To instill terror and disrupt everyday life.to feel that they are strong in there countryI feel very bad about what happened. I believe these cowards should be caught and be put into jail. Some people feel that they should be killed and sometimes I feel the same way too but there are other ways to solve these problems. I feel bad about the families that were involved in this AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THROUGH THIS. Everyone should unite together so that we can have peace and can get through everything that is going on in the whole United States of America. The U.S. should take actions real fast and have more tighter security in the airports and all parts of the country. The day these terrorists attacks occured I thought of my father who works in Wall Street and near the World Trade Center. But I called him and he was alright and I was so happy to hear from him.  Not only was New York attacked but so was the Washington area in the Pentagon. Another plane was crashed into the Pentagon at the same time other lives were being destroyed.  I really do not know how these people got into these planes with the knives as they said that they had so easily without nobody noticing that they had these weapons. This was terrible and many inocent lives were taken away. My last opinion about all this would be to arrest the criminals and make them face the death penalty.  there are many that are involved I believeI have been afraid a littlenone\"I still find myself somewhat agitated when I see pictures of the event, or read stories, and I am still watching the news regularly.

I think it should forgive its enemies and seek to understand them. At the same time, the government should work diligently to bring to justice those guilty of criminal violations associated with last Tuesday\'s massacres. The justice in question should be mediated by the United Nations. Finally, the U.S. should put restrictions on the civil liberties of non-U.S. citizens staying in the country temporarily; we need measures that would allow the government to much more closely monitor their activities while they are in the U.S. This solution would bring into fruitful union humankind\'s oft-expressed  love-your-enemey  ethic (see http://service-net.org/ws/theme145.cfm) and good old American pragmatism. It also recognizes, implicitly, that we as a nation must accept much of the blame for what happened on September 11, 2001. Our terrorism and aviation security experts have been warning us for years that this tragedy was waiting to happen. Our leaders rejected the experts\' recommendations because the measures to prevent last Tuesday\'s events would have meant spending more money and imposing some inconveniences on the traveling public.   Religious fanaticism such as that driving the terrorists of last Tuesday should be considered a severe form of mental illness, and, thus, a destructive force of nature. As with earthquakes and hurricanes, we should want to study, understand, and control the risks as much as we can reasonably afford to, while taking whatever protective measures are necessary to guard against and mitigate potentialities whose eradication is beyond the reach of praticable solutions.   \"\"I think grave, philosophical thoughts more often and express them at the slightest provocation.\"\"These share the blame: 1. fanatic followers of extremist Islamic leaders who hate the U.S. 2. 50 years of U.S. policy in the Middle East that has alienated Islamic nations in order to protect Israel and access to oil 3. insanely rational Islamic fanatics who detest Western values and especially U.S. cultural imperialism 4. penny-pinching, short-sighted U.S. leaders who for years have ignored or only paid lip service to the advice of terrorism and aviation security experts  5. an insanely liberal policy of letting nationals from Islamic nations into the country to do what they want with little or no government monitoring or interference \"\"To win a shocking, demoralizing victory over a powerful enemy, using cunning and unimaginable cruelty\"Because they ARE Muslim TerroristsI\'m more aware of my surroundings when I flyBin Laden and Muslim TerroristsSad very sad.\"Fundamentally different beliefs, values and perceptions of reality and what must necessarily be done to ensure their version of  justice .\"On 11 September I witnessed proof of my long-standing belief that the world is not the safe or peaceful place that many others insisted it to be.\"As yet unidentified terrorist conspirators are DIRECTLY responsible for the attacks.

Yes, I was in NYC on the day of the attack.  I felt like I was in a movie, because the experience was so alien.  But, even from the outrageous imagination of Hollywood directors there has never been a movie as horrific as this reality!  The sophistication and  effectiveness  of the entire operation is mind-boggling.  Of course, the U.S. aims to preserve individual freedoms, which makes it somewhat easier for these things to happen. We are, in fact, often indignant when anyone encroaches on our personal freedom the slightest manner.  In airports, passengers routinely get hostile and aggressive because they are asked to go through a metal detector twice.  Things will be different now--in many ways.   On the day of the attack I was approaching NYC by commuter train.  As the train approached the city, a woman sitting across from me received a call on her cell phone.  She was talking very loud and annoying everyone around her.  When she got off of the phone, she announced that her husband called from downtown to tell her a plane had flown into the WTC.  My first reaction was that this was a terrible accident.  About 15 minutes later the train conductor announced that two(!) planes had crashed into the towers.  I immediately knew that this was no accident.  We all looked out the window from the train and witnessed the horrific scene.   When I got to NYC, I went to a scheduled meeting with colleagues mid-town NY, near Grand Central Station.  The reality and hugeness of this event had not yet set in psychologically I still felt compelled to go to a meeting and I did not feel uncomfortable being in Grand Central, even though it is an obvious target for terrorism.  On my way to my appointment, I was watching for reactions on the street and listening to my Walkman radio for news, but there was little information being provided.  Time seemed to stand still and to stretch into infinity.  The time span from 8:50 to 9:30 seemed like an entire day.   When I got with my colleagues, everyone was confused about exactly what to do.  Some people actually wanted to continue with the meeting as if nothing had happened.  (Denial is easy when the reality is so unbelievable!)  Others, including me, tried to get news to our family and friends to let them know we were safe and to find out whether they are safe.  This act was instinctual.  However, all cellular phones were not working and all other phone lines were jammed.  Amazingly, the Internet was still working and we were able to email some people.   My good colleague and friend, Tracey Revenson, lives in NYC, and her 6-year-old daughter, Molly, was at school 30 something blocks south of us and closer to  ground zero.   Tracey was naturally concerned and nervous, so we left to get her daughter.  It would be a long walk.  All subways were stopped and many of the streets were being closed down to allow emergency vehicles to get through.  The streets also became increasingly congested with pedestrians as business after business closed down, making it more difficult to get to our destination.  On this surreal walk in the direction of the disaster, we heard snippets of news from passersby on the street--a plane had struck the Pentagon, 8 hijacked planes were heading to various cities, like San Francisco and Chicago, etc.  Of course, some of this information turned out to be false, thank God.  On our way to Molly s school, we had intended to stop at the CUNY Graduate Center, to see if my class on  Urban Health  was canceled.  By the time we got the Graduate Center reality had set in deep enough for me to realize that there would be no classes that day, and if there were, I would not be teaching one.   The Graduate Center is across the street from the Empire State Building on Fifth Avenue.  I was relieved to see the Empire was evacuated, because my sister-in-law works there.  The streets were getting increasingly crowded.  As Tracey and I looked down the Fifth Ave, there was suddenly a large poof of black smoke and everyone gasped the second tower had collapsed!  Incomprehensible.  Indescribable.  Unbelievable.  A chill ran through us all.  Tears flowed.  Many people just hugged one another.   Something about the towers actually collapsing made the full horror of the events set in.   With increasing urgency, we pushed through the crowds to get to the school.  On the way, we stopped at the building that houses the Disney Corporation, because Tracey s sister works there and we wanted to try to use a phone again.  I was still unable to reach my wife or parents.  Being in the Disney offices made the day even more surreal, because everywhere we looked there were hyper-happy characters Mickey, Minnie, Pluto beaming at us from posters and display cases.   To terrorists these characters probably symbolize American capitalism and oppression, but to me they symbolize comfort and joy, a flashback to the innocence and simple pleasures of early childhood an experience that I enjoyed and want my 3-year-old daughter Brianna to enjoy.  Being at Disney Corp flooded my mind with thoughts of Brianna, who was in pre-school in CT, some 40 miles away.  [I later learned that my daughter s pre-school, which is in the Jewish Community Center, was closed and armed guards were brought in because of fears of terrorist attacks.  Thankfully, nothing bad happened, but my wife was contacted and told that the school was closing.  She, of course, was in a terrible state her husband was in NYC, her father had flown to Washington DC on business that morning, her daughter s school was closing because of concerns of terrorism.]  We finally got to the school and retrieved Molly, who was physically ok.  However, Molly and her friends had all witnessed the events out of the window of their school.  Like all parents, Tracey began to wonder how she would explain all of this to her child in a way that she would still feel safe.  We then found Tracey s husband Ed on the streets, and their family was whole.  By then, it was only 11:30 am, but seemed much later.  I felt a strong need to get with my family.  Finally, I reached my wife Stefanie by phone.  She informed me that my parents were all right.  They had flown out of Logan that morning on a westbound flight United flight.  They were now on their way to Canada.  I was relieved to hear this, but also surprised because I thought they had flown out the day before.   I now needed to get to my home in Connecticut, but did not know how to get out of NY.  The City had been sealed, so nobody could enter.   A growing number of streets were closed and subway service was still halted.  There was limited train service at Grand Central Station, which could get me home, but it was not clear that the station was safe at that time.   I also needed to reach my sister-in-law, Meri, who lives on E. 26th Street.  Ordinarily it would take 20 mins to walk the mile to her house, but on this day it took an hour because there were so many people walking.  The streets had now taken on a very eerie feeling: the sky was perfectly blue and clear, except for the billowing smoke from the towers, thousands of people were walking, and the National Guard was out; normal street din was replaced with the sonic boom of bomber planes overhead and the scream of sirens from emergency vehicles heading every which way.  I reach Meri and felt great relief to embrace a family member.  After a couple of hours, it was time to go to Grand Central Station, where I had started my day, and make my way home to CT.   Fairfield stop next  never sounded so good.  I was home. Of course, the horror continues as we learn about effects of this disaster on family, friends, and strangers.  At the same time, we are seeing a surge of heroism, volunteerism and national pride.  I was in a store yesterday and felt an urge to buy a flag.  I have never been a flag-waver, but cannot control this feeling.  What is happening?  Extreme nationalism, like religious zeal, is dangerous, as these terrorist acts have shown.  But this urge to bond and unite with neighbors and countrymen is almost reflexive, like the urge to go to and gather together one s family and friends during crisis, the tendency to affiliate, even with strangers on the street.  The created sense of being part of a greater, larger social entity brings some comfort and meaning to life during crisis.  My heart goes out to those who have lost their loved ones and we must honor and respect the hundreds of men and women who have sacrificed their life in efforts to rescue others.  We are also seeing in America a pervasive spirit of giving and kindness toward others that has not been witnessed before, at least not in my lifetime.  Similarly, we are hearing more and more about acts of corporate and global goodwill.  Hopefully this will not all be a temporary change. It is a new America.  It is a new world.  Hopefully some day we will be able to say the result is a better world, but it is difficult to envision that today.

I had an irrational desire to hunt down and kill all arabs and muslims in the world. I\'ve had fantasies of seeing nuclear bombs going off in Mecca and Medina during Ramadan. I\'ve dreamt of being on the hijacked planes and subduing the hijackers, then torturing them before the plane landed. I would castrate them, carve  muslim pig  on their foreheads, blind them in an eye, and smear them with pig fat or pig byproducts. I\'ve searched the Web to find pictures of muslims who have died horribly, and have had some enjoyment seeing te pictures. I still think that while there are good muslims, they have allowed their religion to be hijacked by evil people.I strongly believe that islam is an evil, hateful and primitive religion, and we will eventually have to have a global war against them.

My mother woke us up with a phone call at 6:15am our time on the 11th saying that two planes had hit the WTC.  We immediately watched the rest of the day\'s events live on TV, the bulletins coming in about the Pentagon and the other plane crash in PA.  We saw first the south tower and then the north tower collapse.  It was shocking to see live because the tv commentators did not seem to know it was happening, there was no narrator or voice saying it was happening, they were talking about something else.  So my wife and I were in shock at what we thought we saw and in horror as enough dust blew away to confirm that one tower was missing, then the horror of seeing the second one collapse.  My wife was physically sick, we were both holding each other and sobbing.  I remember having to drive somewhere that morning and being angry at the people here who didn\'t seem to care, out playing golf, nothing closed, as if hey it is just New York not  us.  We were in shock pretty much the rest of the day.  We kept waiting, worried that more things were going to happen.  When the buildings came down we were sobbing knowing how many people had just died.  Living there we knew that about 50000 people worked in those buildings.  Phones were out so we used email to frantically see how our colleagues and friends back home were doing, thank god they were all accounted for though there were two close calls.  One colleague had just landed at JFK from California an hour before the attack and said he had had a great view of the WTC while flying over it.  Just 2 hours later both towers were gone.  Our view out our apt was of Wall street; it is going to be so strange to look at that view when we get back to New York.  We wished we had been there and had not been far away, unable to help or be with friends and support other New Yorkers.  \"\"Watching more News TV (almost nonstop during working days - I have TV in office for monitoring local news as part of my job as municipal  public information officer )  Arriving earlier at airport for air travle that has continued despite events and threats every weekend since 9/11 attack for side business and family gathering  Reaching out more to Afganni woman in our office, discssing Afgani politics and history and social patterns of people there and Afganis in USA.

I am concerned that a simplistic retaliatory response will play directly to the terrorists\' strengths (unity, belief in their moral superiority, etc).  Such retaliation may be precisely what Bin Laden et al are hoping for.      We must isolate our response to them from our response to Islam (even \'radical\' Islam) in general.  We must distinguish mass murder from understandable criticism of U.S. (and European) policies toward the mid-east.  In doing so, we may ultimately undermine the support the terrorists receive from other Islamic people.    I am afraid that our current executive branch is comprised of exactly the wrong people for such a textured, thoughtful approach.  They are  black and white  cold warriors.

I have realized for years that being around large crowds and/or  high-value  locations does increase ones exposure to a potential terrorist attack, but in general, this realization does not normally alter my behavior to a large degree. I am dismayed by the reactions of many people who seem to be willing to trade any level of freedom in order to feel  safe . One can never truly be  safe . People need to learn to deal with that reality.\"I feel very bad about what happened. I believe these cowards should be caught and be put into jail. Some people feel that they should be killed and sometimes I feel the same way too but there are other ways to solve these problems. I feel bad about the families that were involved in this AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THROUGH THIS. Everyone should unite together so that we can have peace and can get through everything that is going on in the whole United States of America. The U.S. should take actions real fast and have more tighter security in the airports and all parts of the country. The day these terrorists attacks occured I thought of my father who works in Wall Street and near the World Trade Center. But I called him and he was alright and I was so happy to hear from him.  Not only was New York attacked but so was the Washington area in the Pentagon. Another plane was crashed into the Pentagon at the same time other lives were being destroyed.  I really do not know how these people got into these planes with the knives as they said that they had so easily without nobody noticing that they had these weapons. This was terrible and many inocent lives were taken away. My last opinion about all this would be to arrest the criminals and make them face the death penalty.  To destroy lives and see them suffer and to show how strong they are.I really do not know but I belive there are many that are involved in the attacks.Ive been afraid a little.all of us\"It was a terrible event which shocked me a lot, because nobody has the right to proceed in this way. Obviuosly, when I saw the towers collpasing, I felt impotent, angry, and with a feeling of defenseless. I Think that there is no justification, but there is some explanation, because the U.S. is a belligerant country and the philosophy of war is always present in their daily life relations. That is all for the moment.  \"\"adopting a personal protection, some kind of paranoic behaviors\"personal revenge\"I am saddened by both the loss of life and by the permanent change to the New York skyline. At first I was shocked that the United States was so vulnerable to an attack on this scale, but I also realize that for many people around the world, vulnerability to terror and war are a routine part of life. While I in no way condone the attacks of the 11th, I believe the United States has an obligation to understand the circumstances that created this level of hatred and resentment toward the United States. I am profoundly disturbed to hear our president say that  they hate us because we are free,  or  I have no idea why anyone would want to do this America because Americans are so good.  I don\'t believe that this level of simple-minded \'us versus them  rhetoric will be very effective in ending terrorism here or throughout the world.  \"bin LadenResentment toward the United States for policies that are in the US\'s best interest without regard for the suffering of others unless it is convenient.I watch far more news and read more newspapers.',3,-5,0,2,5,0,4.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,1.08,0,7.53,0,0,0,0,3.23,0,1.08,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,1.62,0,0,1.61,6.99,1.08,0,0,4.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.19,0,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.35,3.23,0,8.07,0,0,0,1.08,0,3.23,0,0,0,0,0,22.06,5.93,3.23,0.54,0,0,12.37,0,0,0,0,3.23,0,0,2.16,0,0,3.23,Male
'\"The attacks on the innocent people in the different buildings on September 11, 2001 were acts of religious zealots that have been brainwashed into thinking that these acts will make them martyrs.  In actuallity, they are nothing more than misguided fanatics that are murders of innocent men, women, and children. From what I understand, nowhere in the Islamic religion is type of murderous act condoned or promoted.  The leaders of these fanatics can be likened unto Jim Jones, who in the name of religion, killed American officials and then convinced some 900 people to kill themselves.Then there was the  Outer Space  madman in California who also had his followers kill themselves.In addition, we are now hearing that this type of religious fanaticism is being taught to  school chidren at early ages, thereby insuring more generations of zealots. The unique thing about this attack is that it might have done more for world peace than anyone could have imagined. The majority of all countries in the world have formed a coalition to fight terrorism and if the coalition stays together, eventually these people will have nowhere to go. This is probably the first time in history that this many countries have joined together in a common goal, and I hope and pray that it is the dawn of a new ara of unparalled peace on earth. \"Brainwashed to believe that God/Allah will bless them.NoneReligious fanatics more than likely loyal to Osama bin Laden.the attack on the usa was done by a cowerd on they have not taken  any of our freedom because freedom is in our heartswho do you thinkmore aware of whats going ondumb assThe same reason we are bombing mud hut and caves.Foreign policyNone at all except maybe a little nicer to foreigners.I do not think it would have happened if the US had made at least six small changes in its foreign policy since the Gulf War.  1) The US should have taken all US troops out of Saudi Arabia as soon as Iraq surrendered. 2) The US should have demanded that all Jewish settlers leave the West bank. 3) Allowed free trade with Iraq after the surrender. 4) Secured a homeland for the Kurds and.  5) Cleared Afghanistan of mines and provided a sort of Marshall Plan for that country. 6) Pressure Russia over more autonomy for Chyechnya (sp?). \"first it was disbelief, this is not happening, then it was wow almost exciting, i know that sounds sick, but it was a bit of an adrenalin kick , then after about an hour i thought fucking hell this is serious shit, then when i saw the people jumping out the windows i thought \'what would i do\' jump or fry, i would jump i told myself, then i thought of the families of those trapped and as a father i really was sad, i said a prayer later that night and was feeling angry, hit them and hit them hard i thought - the ones that did this and where they came from, but in reflexion i thought that the afgans are a people with very little, drought, poverty, war fear...should we add to that, so i hope that the mass people do not get hurt by any US reaction as i then thought of the afgan kids and how they might be fatherless as the new york victims  families are and i symathise with all, no one wins everyone looses and now i am sad for all , one thing though wich annoyed me is the americans saying god bless america...fuck that god bless everyone, if the american big boy of the world was a bit more sensitive to fellow mankind then this could might have been avoided and now they are sending war ships \"because america with their policies help cause poverty in certain countriesterrorists from the middle east and USA for being unsensitive about the middle eastern peopleno changemoney- dehumanizationGlobalizationpromote understanding in transcultural setting\"This a reaction of imposing transcultural thought.

It always breaks my heart when so many innocent people are killed, and my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims. Every day, many more people suffer and die at the hands of people who seem to have no respect for human life. I would hope that events such as this one will open the eyes of people everywhere and make them realise that hatred never does anyone any good, and that it will only lead to more hatred, which always results in the suffering of the innocent. the american people should realise that they are not alone in their sorrow and anger. but they should not act out of anger, but rather reach out to everyone who desires peace and is tired of all the mindless hatred that we humans seem to breed so readily. I think we might just be surprised at how many such people of all races, religions and cultures we would find. only together can we hope to rid the world of the powerhungry fanatics responsible for the many tragedies that occur on a regular basis.\"I do not know. But I do not believe that we can point the finger at a single individual.0\"Because they believe strongly in their principles, which the US (and free world) mostly represent an opposition to, and they are too poor and weak to fight for their beliefs through more conventional methods.\"\"I was shocked and saddened by the sight of real people in the US dying. The over-exploitation of the video and photo pictures by the news media also disgusted and hurt me. Many people around me are saying that the US should have expected something like this after their history with Afghanistan, Osama Bin Laden and the middle east. I believe that the US does not deserve these attacks because they uphold (mostly) the principles of freedom and human rights, on their own shores and, although sometimes wrongly, in other countries. I am worried that an ill-concieved or hasty retaliation by the US could have far reaching consequences that will eventually affect my life directly. I am worried that the Muslim - Christianity divide will be  more volatile than ever before. Hopefully, the conflict will be limited to the aggressors and not affect innocent civilians.\"\"The hijackers.

On the one hand, I feel sadness and grief for the victims and their families.  I am at least equally moved, however, by the many acts of heroism ranging from: (a) the NY firefighters trying to climb all those flights of stairs with very heavy equipment, if not certain that they were racing to their deaths, they must have realized that it was at least a good possibility, (b) the individuals aboard the flight that went down in Pennsylvania who must have overpowered the hijackers to make sure that others did not also lose their lives, to (c) the stories of individuals in the WTC who helped others in their firms to get out until it was too late to get out themselves or the fellow who stayed with and tried to help his quadripelegic friend and ended up dying with him rather than getting out himself, etc.  The fact that the terrorists could do such a horrible act only goes to show what awful things humans - and I do mean all of us - are capable of; to me, this merely serves to shed light on the nobility of the heroic acts - heroic acts are choices, we are not robots who are programmed only to do good, when we do good we do so as choices over more base impulses and urges. Am I fearul?  Will I stop flying?  No, I believe that most of us live life with the implicit illusion that tomorrow is guaranteed.  But tomorrow is not guaranteed, never was (not even before these horrible attacks) and never will be.  Life is a terminal illness and we take risk every day by getting out of bed.  No, to the contrary, I believe that events like these can serve as reminders that life is to be celebrated while we can and that we should make the most out of every moment so that we will not die with regrets whenever that might be.  I only wish that so many of us, myself included, did not need such sad and paniful events like these to remind us of this truth. One final word is that I know from your email you believe that views are changing over time but the views and feelings I expressed above are those that I have had pretty much from the outset (I have given interviews to this effect if you would like documentation).\"Islamic fundamentalists probably including Osamah bin Laden but undoubtedly many others as well',3,-5,0,2,5,1.61,4.28,0,0,0,0.54,0,1.07,0,0,1.07,0,14.47,0,1.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.5,2.68,0,1.07,3.21,0,0,0,5.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,46.6,0,6.43,0,1.07,0,0,0,0,56.78,5.36,0,4.28,0,0,0,2.68,0,1.07,0,0,0,0,0,19.82,10.18,1.07,1.07,0,0,4.28,0,0,1.61,0,0,0,0,2.68,0,0,0.54,Male
'no real changes. \"I don\'t really know. I guess the Bin Laden group, but who will bring them to a trial so that we get real proof?\"\"The whole story is scary.  This terrorist act killed thousands of innocents and it makes me feel very sad. But i feel very bad also to see that people gather so quickly around their flag. Those flags everywhere in the streets, on cars, on TV, on newspaper make me feel almost equally unhappy as the images of the towers falling. One thing is solidarity with the victims, another is the desire for revenge.I think that some other thousands of innocents are going to be killed somewhere.  This planet is not getting any better. \"someone who loose their mind out of some anger Anti-capitalists ?  3rd world freedom fighters ?  IRAQ ? Bush Adminisatration ? Oil Tycoons ? Some new cranky religous cult ? U.S. high school kids who became pilots instead of shooting their class mates ? International Terrorist group ?\"My first thought was,  hmmn, not so untouchable now eh?  Over the next few days I wondered who would do this, who stood to profit and found the speed at which the FBI gathered their \'evidence\' somewhat incredible. It took 4-6 years to work out what happened in the Lockerbie Air bombing. My actual feelings at this time were absolute fear of what America would do in response. Those fears have NOT diminshed greatly as the world sits on the brink of a crusade Vs a Jihad. I am afraid for the innocent  victims of greater suffering due to retaliation. I am afraid of being  sucked in to another world war. I am ultimatley afraid that the human  race may be passing up it\'s last chance to survive the ecological  runaway train we\'ve already set in motion. I believe the concept depicted by the Author Isac Asimov in his story  \'Foundation\' where our society goes through \'tidal flows\' of  civilisation and technology. I also believe there are only a finite  number of chances to \'get it right\' before our planet becomes part  of our sun. The tidal flow may also be as extreme as the planet being striped back to basic \'amoeba\' in another huge ice age where life  would have to evolve again before it could get to grips with science. I fear that some high ranking political group in America could have executed this plan in order to channel the American public in to a war frenzy which they can aim at anyone they like. Bush wasn\'t exactly a popular choice of leader before this was he ?  It reminds me of Hitler\'s \'leg up\' to power when he blamed the burning of the Reichstag on the communists, ousted them and united Germany in a surge of Nationalism.  Everybody in the League of Nations appeased Hitler to avoid war and  allowed him to re-unite most of the Austro-hungarian empire before finally declaring his re-patriotism of Poland an invasion. The world is scared and many people are prepared to do Americas biding because they agree that the attack on the WTC was atrocious and  despicable. They do not want to be seen to condone it. The same fear runs through the American public, as it did the German public in 1938. No one can speak out against the calls for \'Justice\'. I don\'t believe the CIA findings. The US are on a power trip that  they haven\'t been able to indulge in since Vietnam. 92\% of the U.S.  want war and they have a universally accepted excuse to point the finger at whoever they like, including any government they decide is harbouring a terrorist. This is a chance to tip the power balance of the world big time and most nations are prepared to \'appease\'  the U.S.  - I hope you guys listen to the rest of us when we say  \'enough\' and the world doesn\'t have to go to war with America ! I am saddened by the human loss and suffering of the attack, but I don\'t rate Americans above the rest of the world. People are dying and suffering in their millions because of political situations the U.S. government has had more than a small hand in.  Afghanistan is a mess - don\'t bomb it, help it. I want less stick, more carrot. I wish people could grow more empathy and understanding from the attack and use it to make a global peace and co-operation never before seen - not to hate everyone whose got half a reason to complain about what America has done in the past then go and kick shit out of them. Still, I\'ll be dead sometime in the next 40 years, most probably with no offspring - why should I care what the human race does ?

I have come to think that whilst nobody directly involved in the events in any way deserved to be affected (i.e. killed, bereaved, traumatised, etc.), the United States as a whole is not entirely blameless. The cause of this tragedy needs to be examined, even though this will further affect those most involved since they will possibly see dialogue between the attackers and the US government as insensitive.\"Not at all.Through a misunderstanding of the intention of US foreign policy.To coward and stupid to attempt to use rational means to straighten out differences\" As a 21 year old, I missed the harshest years of the cold war, and have lived in a  country that I feel has represented my ideals.

Israel has its rights, but so have the Palistinians. And now the Israelis have voted the Prime minester, a war criminal, who let the Falangistas murder refugees in closed champs. He should be facing the tribune in the Hauge, along with Milocevits.  \"000\"These questions are unanswerable, they assume a position of supporting the US - my answers would relate not to the attack on the US but the response of the US\"0\"America received retribution for the terrorist act it has committed with impunity around the world. America should have become humble and apologised for its behaviour, and attempted to talk with the people who do not like America. Instead, it demonstrates that it is as mad as the people who committed the acts by murdering innocent people in Afghanistan and elsewhere. I do feel for the people who died in the WTC and in the Pentagon, most were innocent people who just want to get on with their lives. But I also feel for the hundreds of thousands of innocents who have died in Iraq because of US terror, or the thousands of Palestinians who are dying partly through US support of Israel (the quintessential terrorist state).\"Some secret service like the mossad or a combination of them.To keep the opium flowing (the taliban are eradicating it) and / or to eliminate muslims in favour of the jews.\"Everything we hear is disinformation: I do not believe the attacks to be from terrorist but either from  the mossad to generate war agains the muslim world, or from a combination of special services to keep the opium drug trade and at the same time do something in favour of israel and the jews. In any case, everything we are told is fabricated and untrue for  the most part, and the world is going to suffer from all this and because of the stupidity and greed of a few. In any case, IF the attack has been made by real muslim terrorists as jihad, it is understandable that they are angra against the US,  which has been supporting the genocide of Palestinians and other  populations in the world, and which has been playing the cops of the whole world for enough time yet. But, again, i do not think it has to  do with Jihad.\"\"I belive even less in the news, especially CNN and all the jewis manipulated media\"\"Osama Bin Laden, maybe Saddam Hussein\"\"I believe this is the worst tragedy in our history-- Pearl Harbor only lost 2500 people--- not to take that lightly, but they were military---- not innocent men, women and children! This is the first time America has been attacked since the War of 1812-- when the British overran the White House, and James and Dolly Madison fled! That was 189 years ago! We waited too long--- 2 American facilities bombed 2 years ago, the USS Cole bombed last year-- we should have acted then! Should have acted as Reagan did against Libya and Moamar Kadafe-- that ended terrorism for many years! We have let these people run over us so long, that they no longer fear us!!!!!!!  I also think that the news media should stay out of the war. Wait until one of our covert operations blows up a bunker, thought to contain terrorists, and turns out to be civilians!!!! Then the news media will tell the whole world what happened. We know that in all wars, including WWII, there were civilians and our own soldiers killed by friendly fire. But we didn\'t need anybody there to report this!! There are casualties in any war! We don\'t need the news joining in our secret operations. I think they tell too much now, to the world, for our own good as Americans! Time to kick ass and take names!!! If they get away with this- we are through as a country. We will be completely overrun, by our enemies. Also, I would like to know how these idiot, pacifist college kids, think we should let this pass??? What is their solution? How do you deal with people who think that by killing themselves and thousands of others, they are doing a wonderful deed, and will be rewarded in the after life for such deeds? DUH??? I feel sure that WE will have no problem, with these people, at the negotiating table, coming to some good sound resolutions, based on good judgement and logic! Yeah? Right? After all, look at their own countries-- constantly torn apart and devastated by war among themselves. Their people are starving, homeless, no hope, no where to go! Living like animals in the desert! Millions of widows and orphans. This is their OWN people- not their enemies! Their own people are starving, yet they have enough time and money for WAR??? What\'s wrong with this picture? These people are warmongers- born and bred to fight- after all, they\'ve only been fighting for thousands of years. At best, with the desert-like condition of the areas they live in, it would hard to scratch up a living! They don\'t throw their money away foolishly, on things such as food, clothing, and shelter. Hell no, they buy important stuff, like missles, mortar rockets and ammo!!! Same with their time--- they don\'t waste their time with things like growing crops, building homes and planning a future for their children! Their time is too valuable- what, with all the killing, bombing and wreaking havoc on their neigbors going on- and living in the ground like rats, they just don\'t have time for foolish things in life! A very forward people too, I might add! Women not allowed education. They are kicked around like dogs! Men jailed for not having long enough beards. Limbs severed for simple crimes! Very progressive group- Why, they\'re moving right along! I figure in a couple hundred years, if they don\'t kill each other off, they\'ll be moving right up into the 1st century AD.

'\"I am distressed that I am in the middle--cognitively and morally--in some ways. The attack was unmitigated evil--period, period. And as an American I want to believe that we will prevail. But both liberal and conservative comments are short-sighted. 1. Radical Islam has more support than we want to believe--the Saudis  support it to save their own skins even if the top folks live lives  that are not compatible with it. 2. Our society has become the cultural opposite of the ideals of Islam  and the ideals of Christianity. Chuck Colson\'s comments to the  world religion conference in 1993 described the USA and western in  general beliefs in (a) goodness of humanity and denying evil in  ourselves (we are all victims, never villians), (b) human nature can be perfected by governments (not recognizing that 20th century governments have  killed more of their own citizens that have been killed in wars), (c) moral \\ values are relative (we are urged to tolerate, nay, affirm anything),  and (d) radical individualism and consumerism. These views corrode all faiths. The west has sought to cut the tie between our culture and Christian  faith--forgetting the our freedoms are possible only through internal restraint. Does our culture have the guts to confront radical Islam? I am apprehensive.\"They hate the western life style.Radical Muslims\"I am apprehensive of the future.

The following sunday I went to my church youth group, and when I came home I just started to cry.  I had this deep burden kind of feeling on my chest the entire week and I just broke down.  About a week after the event, I started to become angry at the ignorance my fellow Americans were showing by harrassing, vandalizing and persecuting people of Arab descent.  I am a firm believer in equal rights to all and these people who said they were doing it out of patriotism need to read our country\'s constitution.  I now feel as though it was just a dream and that it wasn\'t real when I look back on the tragic event\"Look at the bigger picture before looking at the smaller picture\"Before the disasterous September 11 morning my thoughts were directed towards my  college experience and my friends.  After the monumental day my perspective on life  changed the way i view others inside this country.  My views became narrowed on  seeing everyone who looked the same as the suspected terrorist of the events.  Then  after a couple of days of acting irrational i settled down and told myself, the acts  were of only one group of people just as those of the KKK.  After telling and reconciling myself i am trying to figure out why people act in ways to hurt others.   I don\'t think people who act in terrorist ways are rational when flying planes into  buildings or holding anti-american protests.  From an early age these people learn to hate by their guardians until the ideas of hate are burned into their minds.  So i feel sorry for everybody in the world for experiencing hate for it is not a rational state of mind.  \"Radical Americans mixed with sub-groups of outside terroristsIrrational thinkingThey are taught to hate instead of LoveI am afraid of what will happen next.

The events of Sept 11th have changed my world forever. When I saw the Trade towers coming down it was so unbelievable. How could this happen? There were people in those buildings and no one could do anything to help. It was hard to watch yet I was drawn to it. I felt like I was apart of it. Terrorism has crossed our borders and now it seems more real. What is the next step? Where do we go from here?they haven\'tOsama Bin Laden and his followers\"The September 11 attack on the United States was nothing more than a cowardly act of rage against the people of the United States.  It was not instigated by the U.S., nor was it brought upon the U.S. due to any kind of logical reason.  Osama Bin Laden, the likely culprit, and his followers apparently feel such hatred within their souls that they can somehow justify the taking of innocent, civilian life.  Apparently, just being an American citizen is, to Bin Laden and his followers, and act of complicity in what they consider to be an unjust system.        I suppose that efforts at peace-making and efforts at ending centuries old hatred offend Bin Laden.  I also suppose that he and his followers look at the United States culture as one where women are whores for exposing their hair and legs and one that allows too much freedom among its citizenry.      Well, that is too bad for Bin Laden.  Yes, the United States has sought peace and freedom for the people of the Middle East.  Yet this great nation has supported its many cultures, religious beliefs, and humane religious practices.  And, in nations that are ruled by a calice dictatrial regime, we have not placed blame on its civilians, nor have we considered them complicit.  Instead, we have been nothing less than a catalyst for freedom.        If it is freedom that Bin Laden despises, I have no sympathy.  Too many brave men have fought to ensure freedom to the people of the world, as well as the rest of the world.  Frankly, if Bin Laden hates the U.S. for that, I have no sympathy.  And, when he chooses to attack us on our native soil, he has gone too far.  In his attack of terror on the U.S., whether they be at the U.S.S. Cole, the World Trade Center, or the Pentagon, Bin Laden has gone one step too far.      He must be stopped.  He must be taken dead or alive.  He must not be allowed to take one more life.  He must be stopped in his genocidal activity.  The U.S. must take him. \"For one simple reason: hate\"a silly questions.  The chain of responsibility is long, with many links to history, ignorance, US foreign policy, etc.\"\"First feelings: Shocked and saddened but not surprised. Subsequent feelings: I wish Americans would be more aware of other cultures, of other histories and of the harm that so much of its self-centred American foreign policy does to much of the world.  The terrorist attacks were inexcusable.  But half of the motives for undertaking them are based on legtimate concerns about the effects of American foreign policy on local cultures.  The other half, of course are based on self-interest and on ignorance of the US that is as appalling as US ignorance of other cultures.  Two wrongs don\'t make a right.  While terrorists are being attacked, so too might the lack of understanding and respect that leads both sides to hate each other.\"0\"To get attention, to be feared when there no more hope of being respected.\"I have come to understand that a common view of some foriegn nations is that the US is arrogant and selfish.0terrorists\"There is no doubt in my mind that the tragic events of September 11th must be dealt with and have had a huge impact on our society as a whole.  My biggest fear, however, is that we will retaliate in such a manner that will be  an eye for an eye .  This is a method of retaliation that I strongly disagree with.  A simple exchange of killing innocent people is not an answer to our current problem, yet most people I talk to seem to think it is inevitable.\"Deep ConvictionI feel that the two elements struck  money and power  the  WTC\'s and the Pentagon  were selected because represent Americas oppression of small countries.  There is plenty of history of Amarica supporting a government for American $$ interests (an example is the African Congo)rather than Humanitarian interests.  I feel that Bush has rushed us into a war that is not going to help us.  It seems like the educated minds were still pondering the events of the 11th when the  Rush In  segement of America announced War!  My thought is this:  Would Christ or Buddha have bombed those who are believed to be responsible.  No way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How is it that this country claims to be Christian but doesn\'t follow Christ?  \"America- We killed 500,000 Iraq children with our trade embargo.

'I am deeply disturbed by the recent events.  Needless to say I feel violated.  I am a proponent for significant retaliation involving a much greater target than just those suspects.  I feel that countries knowingly in support of terrorists be punished.  I am concerned that the one-ups-manship of the WTC\'s may be small cities and beyond.Noneunknown\'holy war\' guidelines --no sanctity for human life\"My first feeling was complete shock and denial, followed closely by a feeling of sickness and light headedness. I was deflated for several days and had difficulty doing any work or taking any significant action. By Wednesday, I began to get really angry at those responsible for the attack (although I still don\'t know who they are). For the first time in my life, I felt a sense of patriotism so strong that I entertained thoughts of joining the military to assist in the hunt for the perpetrators and aid in the retaliation. I know that I will follow these events in the news and through friends in Washington DC more so than any other event that has occurred in my life. I feel deeply saddened for the victims, their families and friends, and angry at those who would support this type of attack. At the same time, I\'m angered at those AMericans who would aim their rage at those innocent individuals in our country and others who might be of the same race or religion as our attackers.\"\"Middle Eastern terrorists- maybe a group associated with Osama Bin Laden, but also maybe a group associated with Saddam Hussein\"Because they have felt that Americans have been attacking and injuring their innocent for yearsI spend a lot more time discussing current events The actual planners died in the act -- they were very likely sponsored and encouraged by the Al-Quaida network as charged.\"One thought during the event itself was that a historical perspective was of great comfort: realizing that the identical feelings of helpless outrage were felt by, among many, many others: The British during the Blitz as German bombers nightly destroyed buildings and lives; and citizens of Beirut in one decade, and of Sarajevo in another, as daily mortar fire reduced their beautiful cities to unlivable wreckage. Since the event I have felt strongly that if some of my fellow Americans had a bit more historical sense, they would not go quite so far overboard in their reactions. A second thought is that this has been a very valuable lesson in the power of fanaticism. We have not had to deal with true fanaticism since WWII when the Kamikaze pilots were giving their lives to attack our ships in the Pacific. The fanatic who is genuinely willing, even eager, to die in his (always his) cause is enormously effective and impossible to defend against. Hopefully we will realize as a nation that the only effective prevention is to reduce the conditions that foster fanaticism. A third thought in the aftermath is: what a wonderful education this has been for the Bush administration -- a group that seemed dead set on an isolationist course, abrogating treaties left and right, that suddenly has had to turn 180 degrees and become internationalists. It seems likely that this will carry over into other areas of foreign affairs. \"none\"To make a vivid public demonstration of their rage and to symbolically damage the source, as they saw it, of great evil.\"Misunderstanding of American involvement in the Arab nations.\"The members of the society that has attacked our great nation (whether they be Afghan, Arab, Muslim, or whatever) obviously wanted to upset us. Well, congradulations, it worked! They apparently have a great hatred against our country and I have absolutely no idea why. But the really depressing issue now is that I have now harbored hatred for THEM. I don\'t even know who they are and yet I HATE their very being. I hate their people, I hate their culture, I hate their religion, and I hate eveything. Becuase of their hellish onslaught on my homeland, they have created a new enemy. I was completely OK with Islam up until this terror strike. But they have willingly changed my opinion on every Muslim and Arab I see. Is that really what they wanted? They say they try so very hard to fight for their religion yet it appears all they are doing is making an enemy of the entire world. I do not know why they hate me, but unfortunately the feeling is now mutual. It is sad but true.\"I am planning on enlisting in the armed forces. I also have been watching much more television in order to stay informed.\"The entire Muslim society is at fault. It is said that Osama Bin Ladin is the perpetrator, but we must realize that he is only a representative of their religion.\"\" It made me aware that life is short, and that we must live our life to the fullest...\"\"I was channel surfing that tuesday night at around 10:00pm(Manila). When I tuned in to Fox news channel, I can\'t believe what I just saw! How on earth did it actually happen? In the US?! I have this perception that the US is sort of-untouchable, so to say. If this horrible thing happened there, what more to a developing country like ours!   I fof myself is terribly disturbed by what happened...   God bless America...\"They hate the USTerrorists\"I believe that the events are extremely historic in that they have officially brought our country\'s day to day life into the arena of personally experienced world terrorism.  In addition, they demonstrate that just as Great Britain was vulnerable to guerilla tactics in 1776, we, today\'s super-power, are vulnerable to the same types of attack. Psychologically, the attacks will probably reduce our belief that we are physically insulated from such acts and are relatively invulnerable to the threats that people of other countries face.  In a way, that is a good thing because it should cause us to commit ourselves more intensely to building world alliances to fight and defeat such terrorists.  In addition, it appears to be pulling our people together more intimately to stand up as a united nation to defend and profess our way of life and our values. As a believer in reincarnation and the unified fabric of life, eternal life as it were, I feel great sorrow for the families of the victims, but do not feel that humanity is truly threatened.  This is because I believe that all experiences, both joyful and terrible, are simply part of the continually unfolding journey of both individuals and humankind.  The important thing is for all people to recognize our common humanity and to keep trying to be what we are intended to be in the grand scheme of things.   Having said that, I also feel that it is important for our country to take strong and decisive action to find and hold accountable the people and organizations that are responsible for both executing and supporting these attacks on society.  In doing so, we need to reaffirm our position of world leadership and support of human values. Finally, on a more visceral note, we should kick ass as long as we find the right ass to kick! \"Intense psychological pathology and hatred based on cultural influencesOsama bin-LadenVery little; more overtly expressed patriotismBuilt up anger due to poor living conditions and oppression from the American Government.\"As stated before in my previouse answer, the US has picked too many fights with developing countries not taking in consideration the effects it will have on their people.  We have supported the rise of industry on an international bases in efforts to better serve the needs and wants of our people while killing and disturbing the lives of millions elsewhere.  We have sanctioned governments that were poor to begin with.  We made promises during the cold war that we would help rebuild afganistan if they would help us defeat Russia and never did.  They attacked Saudia Arabia the home of Osuma Bin Laden who was once our allie and then say the attaks as a smack to the face.  The US has lied, and manipulated the minds of its people.  \"\"When I see a plan I do not think of family vactions or its designation.  I see a weapon in the sky that could be aimed at my work place.  My attitudes have changed from offensive to defensive.  I try to fight for the rights of those here in the US that are being judged based on ther race, culture or ethnic background.\"\"The events that occured on the 11 have plagued my mind since it happened.  My feelings have been rather mixed and diferent.  I have been contemplatig the numerous deaths that have been taken.  This was not an attack on freedom, but an attack on huamnity.  Because of our evil government many families are sobing holding on to only memories of dear ones.  Our governemnt has not been upfront with its people.  It is an imperialistic monster that supports industry over its people.  Look at Nigeria and Shell, also look at ITT and the Copper fields in Chile under the fall of Allende.  The US has been single handedly picking fights  with developing countries and something as disasterous as 9-11-01 was bound to come.  I feel that we need to reevalute what our government is doing as well as speak our voices.  After all our so called elected officials are not.  Also I feel that our nation must becareful not to revert to nationalism.  We as a people must not judge individuals according to race, color, or ethnic background.  Nor should we consider the US as the best, because although our people maybe the best our government is far from that.  The last thing I will leave with James and Sherlock is that I felt heartbroken to see people die.  I was desturbed and unable to concentrate at work and in class.  As a student of minority backgrond I was in fear of others being hurt.  Not me in particular, but some of my friends.  Our people are good people, but sometimes we channel our energies not necessarily in the right places.    \"BIN LANDEN ORGANAZATIONWANTS WORLD POWERMOER PATRIOTIC THAN EVER \"My deepest thhought are there are no real reson to kill inosent peoble by revenge no matter what reson thay come up with.

I could hardly believe I was seeing the act on the TV.  After thinking about it, I know it represents the feelings of certain people in the international community based upon their perception of this country and its attempt to control other countries through brute force.  I know it is not correct, however, we should take a more even approach in international affairs, particularly in the mid-east.  There is no reason to favor one country over another.  I grieve for the people who were victims of the attack and hope the country helps their families financially.  This was an act against our country and not the victims.  We should do what we can to stablize the international opinion of our country.  We have reacted exactly like the terrorists expected by going balistic and letting these acts disrupt the entire nation.  We should stabilize the economic situation and then plan on how to avoid further acts.  In the case of terrorists, we should very carefully find the ones involved and do what we can to bring them to justice. We now have the international community in our corner and we should not take irresponsible attacks on countries and kill innocent people.  Like a surgeon, we should find the people involved, arrest them, then subject them to our judicial system.  If we do not, we will start a religious war that will not ever end.  Retribution will be the way of the future.  That is the reason we must be extremely careful in our action.\"Nothing except worry like hell over the investments I have in the stock market and be really concerned about the way the country has gone balistic over the events.\"I do not have a clue.

We, the USA (in combination with other 1st- and 2nd-world nations) must stand-up and let these tin-pot pseudo-dictators (like Bin Laden) know that civilized society is NOT going to tolerate this.

We, the USA go around the world helping disaster-stricken nations, help small countries being invaded and taken-over by other war mongering countries . . . yet, is anyone going to  be there  for us?

It is a shocking, disturbing tragedy to see so many people lose their lives during such a senseless act of violence.  Watching everything happen on television the way it did, so many times and so fast was horrible, and seemed unreal.  Never did I think that a landmark such as the World Trade Center would be destroyed, especially the way it happened.  Just imagining two of the tallest buildings in the world being demolished is enough, but seeing airplanes crash into the actual buildings is unbelievable.  It didn\'t even look that bad from the cameras because they were so far and the buildings were so high.  Just thinking about an airplane coming into my office while i\'m walking around boggles my mind.   Terrorism is terrible thing.  It makes you think about genocide and what this world will come to one day.  It\'s sad that it\'s takes an event like this for the city and the rest of the country to not think about themselves all the time for once.  It\'s also sad to see the government agencies on their toes again just because something happens.  The point of security is prevent negative events from occurring, not to find out all of the sources and evidence after it occurs.  If that\'s the case, it\'s senseless to have security in the first place.

I was asleep infront of the TV and as I woke up to go to bed around 1.00am Australian eastern time I watched live as the second plane hit the tower.

I was focused on the building ie a western ICON disappearing. I couldn\'t really believe it was happening. Even now, being so far away makes it seem dreamlike. There has been alot of coverage on Australian TV...the world is so small now.\"\"They haven\'t, its a long way away\"Don\'t knowOsama Bin Laden\"I believe that we as a nation have created tremendous resentment within a subset of the Muslim community.  This, in my opinion, is because of our policies towards Israel and because of our perceived  colonialism  through business and influence in the Middle East.   We now are reaping the consequences of these percieved wrongs.   In my opinion, we should hunt down and kill those responsible, but we should also ask ourselves what is more important to us as a nation, access to cheap petroleum fuel, the security of Israel and the Middle East, or the security of our own cities. Because of our open borders there are many among us that would harm the U.S. and undermine the freedoms that we hold dear.  Purging those from our communities will test us, and tear at the fabric of our liberty.  We must rise to this but in doing so we must not forget that as Americans, it is personal liberty and equality that make us great.  We cannot lose this in the quest for greater security. We also need to understand that brute force alone cannot defeat this type of enemy.  It can solve part of the problem, but as long as there are young men who believe, rightly or wrongly, that the weapons and funding that contributed to their displacement, or the deaths of their families and friends were supplied by the U.S., we will have this problem. What do we care about most? Oil? Peace in the Middle East and the security of Israel? Peace in our own cities? If it weren\'t for oil the Middle East would be another Balkans. \"Resentment towards the U.S. for its policies towards Israel and perceived colonial behavior that is an afront to the fundamentals of IslamI am more aware of my surroundings and suspicious of those who look Middle Eastern.I am less likely to fly anywhere. But that has more to do with airport delays than it does fear of terrorism.\"I am stunned and unable to grasp the magnitude and implications of what happened. Every question seems to lead to more questions about who, why, how . . . I think the bottom line is that we do notknow enough to effectively understand all this or put it in pespective. I think  war on terrorism ,  cowardice ,  evil  and the like are being bandied about as though they effectively summarize the nature of the events and the correct responses. This is oversimplification that will lead to the deaths of many more people. Will a war on terrorism become something futile like the war on drugs?\"I do not know. This is the toughest question I have pondered in the last few days. There is simply not enough information available to form a reasonable theory.\"I do not know. There is simply not enough information available yet, maybe ever.\"\"I am of course deeply horrified by the events of September 11.  That destruction and violence of this magnitude still exist in the world profoundly saddens me.  While I am now a California resident, I lived in New York City for seven years and even worked in the WTC as a temp for a few weeks.  Although I thought of those buildings at times as obnoxious symbols of our imperialistic capitalist tendencies, I also remember dancing on the Pier at Gay Pride events, looking up at the towers and feeling proud to be an American, proud to live in New York City.   In the wake of the crash, many of my friends breathed in smoke, suffered through the catastrophe.   While I do not in any way advocate the notion that America  got what we deserved , in thinking about the attacks I have tried to understand the reasoning behind the people who perpetrated these violent acts.  Of course, it could be argued that these fundamentalist anti-American terrorists are beyond reason.  But I think that the reason why Bin Laden was successful in organizing these attacks can be partly attributed to the fact that anti-American sentiments have been brewing and developing for years in Afghanistan, largely due to our irresponsible foreign policies.  To much of the rest of the world, we as Americans appear as a fat, rich, wasteful, spiritually-dead, greedy, loud people who talk rudely on cell phones in public places and drive our SUVs to work with only one passenger.  I think that many other countries in the world view us negatively because our leaders have not always represented us in a sympathetic light: for example, Bush\'s withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol can be seen as an example of the US\'s blatant disrespect for our position in the world community. That said, I am very proud to be an American.  I am proud of our land, and many of our values.  I am proud of our notions of freedom, justice, equality: although I do not think we live up to these ideals very often.  Our history is full of terrorism: from the slaughtering and terrorizing of American Indians by the early European settlers, including some of our founding fathers, to slavery, to the social inequities that exist in any American city today, you can see that ours in not a perfect, sometimes not even a compassionate, society.   However, I think that as a country, we have proven ourselves to be a strong, united people.  We are resiliant and innovative and creative bunch, we Americans.  Our history includes many developments and accomplishments in technology, the arts, sciences, and humanities that I feel blessed to benefit from.  I hate to see these aspects of our lives being threatened because of a few mad men.  I think that the Taliban is a terrible, evil regime that should be dismantled.  I think that terrorism in all forms is wrong, and that is why I have been glad to see our government acting with some restraint in our handling of this situation.   But I think that some of the lust for retaliation that I have seen among my fellow Americans is as evil as that which our government purports to fight.  Violence and terrorism are wrong, no matter who perpetuates it.  I am glad that our government is doing it\'s best to defend our country during this time, but I am also praying that in our actions overseas, we proceed with caution and respect for civilian life.  \"Human Beings.  I am more aware of my mortality.  \"Jealousy, Anger, Frustration, Insanity\"\"I was horrified by this.  I did not think something like this would ever happen in this world.  When I watched the news, I thought that I was watching a movie.  I did not think it was real.  I thought that soon I would see the newscasters say it was all a joke.  I was terrified that I had someone there that I would never see again.  \"Revenge.  HatredI am scared of planesTerrorists.

The same specie but born in different areas. Borders are just symbolic and political and that\'s all! Most of the countries around the world couldn\'t believe in what happened. It was something we had only seen in movies and would never imagine in real life.  I also think that nowadays TV makes things very normal and we see things as if they were not real, like a video game. What I want to say is that many people don\'t have the idea of how big and agressive it really was, specially if you live in NY. That is how you really have a sense of what happened. I was and I still am very shocked. That is how we see how fragile our lifes are and how many crazy people there are around the world. I was very emotional and couldn\'t stop thinking about it for days. It was an attack agains life and freedom. I think we will never forget what happened.

I hope that this study will help in dealing with the anger otherwise it may turn against individuals or groups that have nothing to do with the attacks.

They represent the start of a complex and intricate plan; they show the strength of the motivation of the people organising and undertaking them; while the loss of life in numerical terms is much lower than more frequent natural disasters, it is more international than any of these.  For many people of the Western world of my generation, it is the closest to war that we have been.  The responses, particularly of the US government, are initially emotional.  There appears little consideration of preventing repetitions through addressing the causes and motivations for the attacks.  Race and religion underly much of the feelings and justifications for the forthcoming retaliation(s) (unlikely to be justice - how many innocents will be killed in the process of  punishing  those involved?).  It should become apparent from the attacks that most people are good and nice most of the time (e.g. New Yorkers talking and relating to strangers in the street). Hopefully leaders will use the events to improve society, particularly to take advantage of the opportunities that only tragedies can offer e.g. everyone is connected and life can be improved by working together.\"\"A group of people - the people who planned it, organised it, funded it and undertook it.\"More sensitive to racist and religious bigotry.

'Perverted religous convictionsOsama Bin Laden\"I feel that we were caught unprepared.  The US was fully aware of the global and national threat of terrorism.  However, the attacks were allowed to occur.  I also feel a sense of strength instead of despair or fear because of the events of Sept. 11th.  The US and some sort of unified international military force will overcome terrorism and the groups and individuals responsible for the attacks on NY and DC will be punished accordingly.  We are a peolple of many differences, but when we are threatened we don\'t scatter and run, we come together and fight with a resolve similar to the  Rath of God .\"none.\"I really cannot comprehend how someone could justify after meticulous planning taking so many people\'s lives.  then again, I would rather go to gaol than serve in any form of armed forces.\"\"This is very complex.  I think the U.S. has to take some responsibility.  I have put this first as they are the only people so far that we definitely know what level of responsibility they are at, certainly not because they are most responsible. The U.S has a foreign policy borne out of \'what\'s in it for me?\'  This is shown in their call to allies,  You\'re either with us or against us  not  let\'s make this world a better place.   By promoting themselves as a religious state to an extent and by encouraging forms of terrorism (Northern Ireland, Nicaragua, abortion centres) often at a government level, there are ways that the U.S government  could have avoided such an attack.  Their recalcitrance at the United Nations when something does not benefit them is not unnoticed around the world (Kyoto protocol, U.S war criminals not legally bound to trial by an international court).  The perpetrators that did this obviously take the most part of the blame.  They planned it, showed complete disregard for human life, and deliberately left us in a confused state to ensure the continuation of violence.  There is no excuse for this type of attack, even though other parties may have to share some responsibility.  If the attackers were from Iraq, then the matter is a little simpler.  The U.S is at war with them, and while Iraqi citizens know what that feels like I don\'t think U.S. citizens do.  I think that the U.S would be wise to begin a strategy of negotiation with Iraq considering that they, and any other country for that matter, will always be vulnerable to violence and destruction.\"\"The only thing is I\'ve been much nicer to my flatmate, who is from Louisiana\"\"First of all, like everyone else I was shocked and horrified by what happened and had nothing but sympathy for the people who knew someone that had died.  I think it would be very difficult not to feel that way. My personal reaction was not one of anger though.  I feel that if you are so hurt by what someone else has done to you then you wouldn\'t consider doing the same thing to someone else.  Even though the attack was  unprovoked  I still feel acting in revenge is philisophically no better than acting out of cold blood.  Self-defence is another matter entirely. Further on this point, this should have alerted people to attrocities occurring elsewhere in the world.  Understanding of the complexities in Palestine, Northern Ireland, Serbia and other places may in fact require you to go through something similar.  Unfortunately the world doesn\'t see this, it seems to be conveyed as \'a new terror\', something that we\'ve never encountered before.  The reality, in my opinion, is that we\'ve seen this terror on countless occassions through history and it has continued endlessly at times.  This has to be realised as we consider our next actions, as the last thing we want to do is be responsible for creating a \'cycle of violence\'.\"Aside from attending vigils and calling family members I can\'t think of any.\"There are direct and indirect contributers? The most obvious answer and most direct contributers were the men who chose to hijack the planes and kill themselves and others. There are the others who helped plan, coordinate, and finance the attack. I think many individuals and countries bear indirect responsibility (e.g., middle east governments that terrorize their peoples, our governtment for directly and indirectly supporting those governments), though i\'m not sure. There is definitely a part of me that resists acknowledging that any life condition could justify what the most direct contributers did.\"\"As most Americans, I was truly shocked and disgusted by the events. My initial reaction was disbelief followed by confusion ( what does this mean? ) and then fear ( our country, my life is unsafe ). These reactions occurred in a span of 10 seconds or so. After it settled in (say within 10 minutes), my next reaction was anger and i had a strong sense of wanting revenge. These were coming from deep within, my uncensored reaction, about which I felt some guilt or at least a sense that these were probably not the most productive feelings to have. Over the last several days, my feelings have become more ambivilant. At times, especially over the next few days, I felt a strong sense that our country needed to respond and that a military response was the only reasonable way to address it (even though I am mostly opposed to war and violence). My reasoning behind these thoughts were mostly practical; eg. we needed to respond in some way, and I didn\'t think violence would provoke more violence b/c I had a sense that terrorists would continue to attack our country regardless of whether we responded aggressively or not. I also became aware of this sense of arrogance about our country\'s power. Even though the events of Tuesday made me feel vulnerable to terrorism, it didn\'t make me feel vulnerable to losing  a war (ie I was underestimating the risk of a violent response b/c I had a strong sense that we would  win  any war. At the same time, I have been exposed to much info (like Frontline on PBS) that took a more balanced view of reasons for the attack, namely us policies in the middle east. while acknowledging this did not justify the attack or even reduce my anger about it, it did prompt me to comtemplate the importance of other reactions to it. I have not had strong negative reactions to individuals (eg bin Laden), just to the act. I remain very angry about it, and I have started to buy into the idea of good vs. evil. By that I mean, while I am sympathetic to the life conditions that have cultivated terrorist mindset and that in some ways it is inevitable perhaps of our own making, it is not a reasonable/acceptable response. Terrorism offers no solutions to the world\'s problems. Do people who adhere to that mindset truly believe that the world would be a better place if they were in power? Civilization would not exist if they were. I only wish people devoted half as much time to improving the world as they do to destroying it. I would also like to send them information on Ghandi and Martin Luther King\'s methodolgy of passive resistance. Such methodology is not only more creative and humane but also more successful in changing our world in productive ways. \"\"Desperation (they may have perceived it as the only solution), selfishness (ensuring themselves of an afterlife in their worldview; or increasing their personal power).

Well I understand, that what had happened in US (terrorists bombing civilian targets) were happening in  India since 20 years! Americans always felt insulated  from terrorists attack till WTC collapse. Well,  look at  Sri Lanka. That small nation was affected with LTTE terror since  20 years.  What was US  doing  during those times?  Did they care even to speak about it ?   Infact, the terrorists  organizations that operate in India and Sri Lanka were being funded by their sympathizers in US, Canada and Europe. Not a single US administration was serious about  taking these matters  to a stop.   Finally,  the otherday terrorism reached  the heartland of US . And now  US is thinking deeply about it. Suddenly, US wants to define terrorism, US wants to clear all the UN dues, US wants  every tiny nation on earth to vote for them on terrorism issue,  US  wants to become an international police on the matters of  terrorism,  US wants Israel to shut their Guns  in the middle east :  What  a  nation ?  What a  change ?  We laugh at it ! After all ,  US should look back and see how they have behaved in the past  when various far away countries lived in fear and pain of  terrorism .  US colluded with various terrorist to get things their way. Various peoples  moments  in Asia were toppled  using  CIA  and  money.  Can\'t we not call it a state sponsored terrorism ? True, Islam is no religion for US. The cultural values of Islam is totally  obsolete. But as US has allowed thousands of  Muslims to immigrate to their country there is very little US can do but to live with them. Through out the world, Islam has become the a real problem to deal with. More over, many many Christian Blacks have been converted to Islam as the Christians have not been able to fully integrate the Blacks into their way of living. So Americans have to live with this thing called Islam. There is another fact too for that religion: Where ever Islam exist, they populate very fast and will never fully integrate with the laws of US. They will continue to teach Arabic and will love Islam more than America.      Today, US  believe that  world economy should integrate. US is forcing economic liberalization on poor nations of the world. For  the US government,  IMF and World Bank is doing that trick.  But then, like economy, peace and terrorism too is an  integrated  commodity.  No nation can remain an isolated peaceful heaven. Remember, US cannot  build a nation free of  war and terrorism when the whole world  is deep in such problems. Like economy, peace  too is integrated. When there is terror through out the world, how can US alone keep it way from their backyard ?    - Abraham    abbyabrahamATsatyam.net.in   \"\"My perspective on the events of september 11th.are smiliar to other i feel anger towards the people who have destoryed our great twin towers.The terrifying bombing on the world tade center has left me, the world shocked i would never expect this.I rember that day it was like watching a movie.upon these attacks it just makes me wounder how safe are we? we  could be attacked any time any where.I think it cause a huge impact on America,America will change.the saddest part is the firefigther and officers we lost.i wonder how many children lost their parents?

I\'m not a survivalist and really don\'t think these supplies will be necessary, but, as the attacks have made clear, you never know.\"\"1)This was not a declaration of  war  against  freedom  or  liberty  or any of the other buzzwords the media and the politicians have force-fed into the country\'s collective consciousness.  Sadly, most Americans are incapable of distinguishing between democracy (a system of government) and capitalism (a system of economics).  Whereas democracy (or a sham-system of representative democracy, in our case) dictates how the infrastructures of our country operate, capitalism determines how our country operates within the greater context of the world.  Colonization and imperialism are perpetuated by the need to expand markets and to obtain resources...to maximize profits.  14 year-olds in the Asian Pacifics work in slave-labor conditions not because of our democracy, but because of our economic system.  Middle Eastern culture and tradition is being deteriorated and mocked not because of our democracy, but because of our crass consumerism.  The attack was not a symbolic attack against  freedom  or  democracy.   They would have attacked the Statue of Liberty or the White House, if that were the case.  This was a practical, direct attack against the world hub of capitalism and the military complex which supports it. 2) Bin Laden may or may not have been behind the attacks.  The media have been quick to finger him as the prime suspect and have been quick to remind the public that he may have been behind past attacks, but have not once mentioned that he was a product of the United States\' foreign policy.  During the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, the CIA trained Bin Laden in terror tactics to be used against Russia.  He was able to drive Russia out, thereby solidifying Afghanistan\'s loyalty to him.  Not once since the attack have I seen an explanation of why Bin Laden remains a  guest  of Afghanistan and why they are not willing to turn him over.  It was the United States\' military presence in India (or Saudi Arabia, I can\'t remember) during the Gulf  War  that turned Bin Laden against the U.S.  Bin Laden served our terroristic pruposes in the past...and it was our economic greed which ultimately turned him against us. 3) Whether it be the CIA-sponsored coup in Chile, the U.S.-trained death squads in Nicaragua (where 30,000 people died as a result of our influence), the estimated 1.5 million Iraqis who have died as a result of the U.S.-led UN sanctions, or any number of other examples, the United States has used terrorism to its advantage time and time again.  It is now time, sadly, that we must reap what we have sown.  Our patirotism is misguided.  Our concern is hollow.  Our indignance is trained.  And our greed and anger are deadly.  Our complacency has been our greatest luxury, and now we will pay for it with our own blood.\"The United StatesSee comments on Page 1not much. Its just sad that someone has so much anger inside himself.

This does not necessarily mean that I support their disagreement.\"\"It is a horrible act and hope to never see it happen again. But while Taliban is getting most of the blame, Taliban is in fact the byproduct of marriage between CIA and ISI.  So, even if we can eliminate Bin Laden and fanatic organizations like Taliban, how can we ensure that such things will not crop up again.  As many newspapers suggested, is the core of all this behind gross disparity in wealth and power between the haves and have nots around the world.  American must use its power to dwell into this aspect as well.\"\"Well, they have Arab features and thus must be somethings associated with Middle East\"Anger of being treated unfairly \"1.

I resist the notion that the WTC is a symbol of the American people (it\'s a symbol of finance and economics, but NOT a symbol of \'our way of life\'. But the belief that it is, is probably why we WERE attacked (as a sign of misplaced priorities).

'No change\"At that time, I was watching an evening TV news. The program had just started, and the caster was confusing what was happening in New York. TV showed one of the twin tower was burning. In the next moment, the airplane hit the other building.     Since then, people talked about violence, which is out of our understanding. We have similar history in Japan during the World War II. Young Japanese men committed suicide bombing as a member of  Kamikaze . It was very quick that people forgot the reality of  Kamikaze  while the fact was left unexplained.    There is big difference between  Kamikaze  and September 11 attacks as well as similarity. I am not sure which is important. I may be wrong, but it seems to me clear that both Japanese and American people have to think about similar question. For Japanese, why were young people willingly to join  Kamikaze . For American people, what does Islam fundamentalism mean. Both are supported by spiritual purity and rigor whether more profoundly relates to religion or not.     Spiritual purity and rigor is grown up in a society where life is limited and political basis is immature. Political maturity requires economical, cultural and social development. It is uncertain that spiritual purity and rigor itself is a power for social development. It is certain that political immaturity makes the present condition worse.    \"some of Islam Fundamentalistsprotest to ignorance and povertyAmerica\"Disbelief, confusion, tears.\"Total frustrationNo change\"i ahve very mixed feelings, on the one hand i feel terrible for al those who lost loved ones either helping in the search for survivors, or those who came down with the building. on the other hand it is so hard to contemplate the fact that the twin towers are no more. i guess we all kind of took it for granted. our country was not at all prepared for this attack, this attack gave our country a taste of what israel goes through from day to day. the attack also brought america more together than ever, our country has shown more patriotism than ever.\"noneosama bin ladenhe is not happy witht the way our country is treating his peopleReligious brain-washingMuch more patriotic\"This is my perspective as a British citizen living in the U.S, a former New Yorker with friends and family in Manhattan. My first instincts were shock and disbelief - how could anyone do this? How could this happen on American soil?? How far have they gotten past our security? If they can do this to America what chance does the rest of the world stand? Then as realization set in it was sadness, worry about friends, fear about how safe we all are. Later I had feelings of anger and wanting to see justice done. Although a forgein national I felt immense pride at the way the nation acted: donations of blood and money, flag fling and general unity. Throughout all the stages I don\'t think the disbelief went away - that they COULD do this to us and they hated us so much as to carry it out.\"\"I believe it is an Islamic fundamentalist group, though bin Laden may be the leader he is not alone.\"It seemed to the terrorists to be a way to be heard.  \"I have received a great number of emails in response to an essay that I wrote regarding the attack.

The  ideals we need now are freedom, self-determination and compassion, things that reflect our virtues, rather than our power, our  might  more than   right .  I have even heard calls for us to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons in  this war on terrorism. I do not take pride in the fact that the US is the only  country to have used nuclear weapons. Not just once, but twice, we did just  what the terrorists did last week, only on a much larger scale, wiping  out two entire cities and leaving many more people to suffer the horrible  effects of radiation. Advocates of the bombings on Nagasaki and Hiroshima  say that the attacks tremendously shortened the war and reduced American  casualties. Is it right to obliterate thousands of non-combatants without  a moment\'s notice?  The terrorists last week thought so, and the US  thought so when it bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I wonder whether we could have  ended the war just as effectively by demonstrating the power of the weapon  without killing an entire population. Maybe not, but I wish we had tried it at  least once. US policies in the middle east have undermined self-determination repeatedly. No  wonder we aren\'t universally loved. It doesn\'t help, either, when Bush refers to  this as a Crusade.  Even conservative commentator Chris Matthews (on  MSNBC) agrees that this is not what we need. What were the crusades? A war  initiated by Christianity against Islam as a whole. Is that what we want to do,  start a war against an entire religion? Is this what we, who live in a country  that takes pride in religious liberty, really want? No, we want to defend  ourselves against terrorists, and to further the rule of law throughout the  world. At least, that\'s what I want.  I have heard calls that the US needs to bomb Afghanistan into the dark ages,   bomb it to hell.  Sorry to be the bearer of disappointing news, but the Soviets  have alrady done that, and the ongoing civil war that has continued since the  Soviets left in 1989 has continued to ensure that the people there _are_ in the  dark ages, in hell.  Our nation\'s military leadership admitted as much when  they said that  there are no targets of great value  in the country. But more  importantly, if the US stands for the killing of innocent people, whether  by using nuclear weapons or through massive bombings of a people subjected to a  backward government that they didn\'t elect and don\'t want, well, then the US has  failed in its aspiration for liberty and justice for all. Like others, I am outraged, shocked, and horrified at the tragic loss that the  terrorists have perpetrated. I want justice. I want vengeance. But I want to  work with the rest of the world in order to achieve these ends. We condemn  vigilanteism among individuals. We need to recognize that the same principle  applies among the community of nations. Because of the attack at the World Trade  Center, there is hardly a country in the world that did not suffer a loss among  its population. Even Pakistan, no industrial power itself, has announced that  approximately 60-80 of its citizens are believed to have died in the attack. Our  victory over terrorism will be greater if we do not become vigilantes during the  fight. Working with the world community will ensure a more lasting victory. \"\"The proximal cause was the terrorists, who wish to  speak out against US policies. The distal cause was the US tendency to act in its own self-interest, and not to seek consistency between our lofty and laudable ideals on the one hand, and our actions that have been quite contrary to those ideals on the other hand.\"\"I\'m not sleeping as much as I used to or need to. I worry that my daughter will not live in a world that knows safety in the same sense that my world did. I feel  melancholic, and concerned that Bush will seek unilateral action when what we need is a broad coalition of support. So, for these reasons, I lose sleep.  I also make sure to tell my family that I love them when  I leave the house. Terrorists are unlikely to strike my small town, but my mortality is more salient to me now than before. I appreciate life, and want to share that with my family.\"i feel it was a terrible incident that should have never happened 000Naive hatred twisted and focused by evil people with their own mission.\"More grateful to be alive, more appreciative of what we have in the US.\"\"Most responsible: those who encouraged, funded and supported the attacks.  Al Qaeda, et al. Next: Governments, including US, who create the alienation that such groups feed off. \"This is a wakeup call for the US.  Our foreign policies have inadvertantly bred an entire generation in many countries who feel so alienated and deprived that they can be easily perverted into terrorists with a deep hatred of a country and a people about which they really know nothing.  The hijackers were victims too.terrorists like the group around Bin Laden\"Desperation, anger, loss of control, strong religious belif system, to become a martyr \"I was more sad\"Well it\'s an awful event where a lot of suffering is involved.  More suffering than a single human being might be able to cope with. It is a horrible picture to think that these thousends of people are burried in the mud and we will not even be abele to identify them or being abele to burry them properly. But it is obviously the seize of the desaster that make most of us suffer with the victims and their families or the media attention, because there is so much trouble in the world and not many people care. Why now? Probably because more happend than just the killing of so many people. Our believe system is shattered together with the falling towers. May be there are associations between the bible picture of the tower of babylon and the towers of the TWC. Probably people will start sooner or later to think different about the big symbols of the globalized and out of control capitalism.  \"\"Refrain from flying, stay clear from the USA,  Hope to god that Bush isn\'t the idiot he appears to be. \"Fanatic fools\"I felt that the attack was disgusting, inhumane and barbaric. But it was also dramatic and distant.  At first glance it looked like a Hollywood Production. But the reality of it all, which sunk in later reveald the horific extent. What I find remarkable is that in diverse media reports the authors state that the US in not safe anymore. Has it ever been? In what other country do schoolchildren shoot their class mates? Wake up, and welcome to the world, perhaps you now understand what it means to be a member of the human race and inhabitant of our one and only planet.

My wife and I were stunned, almost disbelieving.  I went to work, where people were gathered on and off most of the day watching one small TV set in an office.  Most viewed in silence.  Since the attacks and collapse of the buildings, my wife and I have cried, have wondered why, how could anyone be so filled with hatred and disregard for innocent lives that they would do such a thing.  We also marveled at the immense success of the attacks, to completely destroy two symbols of Americas economic greatness.  We were and are deeply saddened by the despicable events, and are concerned about how the evil cancer of terrorism can be excised from the body of Islam.  We also have thoughts about America\'s own indigenous terrorists, the racists, the isolationists, the sad individuals who create computer viruses, who call in bomb threats/scares for their sick amusement, who abuse and kill wives, children, gays, ethnic minorities, etc.  I pray that the tragedy and the unified and supportive response manifested by so much of the nation has lasting significance and will move the nation to a more complete and compassionate understanding of our role in the world and of our past failures to support struggling nations (Afghanistan after the Soviet retreat). \"\"It is unimaginable that someone would do this - but they have.

Having lived and studied there and also having lived in NYC itself, it was devestating to me to see such horror broadcast live.  I thought about the number of people being killed as I watched the towers collapsed and reminisced on how many times I had been to the top of them myself. I don\'t think I will ever truly be able to comprehend what I witnessed...what the world witnessed. I feel the response by the world to hunt down terrorist organisations and eliminate them with extreme prejudice is a just act. However, I am still fearful of what may eventuate as no \'pest\' such as this, can truly be irradicated, at least not in one go. When persicution of fantics occurs, it only gives power to their cause. Nonetheless, we cannot sit idely by and let them have control of our fears.

I got home from work at 11pm on tuesday night and switched on the telly to find it all happening live over there in America. Watching it live was like nothing I have ever experienced. I can\'t imagine what it would have been like for the people on Manhattan Island who saw it with their own eyes, but even on the TV...every event unfolding as you watched. I laughed, not because I was amused, but because the scope of this event was amazing. It was a nervous, disbelieving laugh that just came out. I kept saying \'oh fuck\' as I watched. I knew it was going to be big.  The day after I started to feel scared. My mind probed into the future, mapping out worst case scenarios of World War III and the like. I guess you do that when you\'re afraid. It\'s a fuckn strange thought, the idea that a war in which Australia would potentially be involved may start. It\'s never been on the cards in my lifetime that\'s for sure. I also remember feeling useless (I\'ve heard a lot of people have been experiencing this). I really truly wanted to help somehow, impossible as that would seem. To see so many fellow humans suffering brings out something inside us all I think. I think we have inside us an instinct to help others in times of danger/crisis etc, and it was interesting because for me personally, I don\'t think it\'s ever really manifested itself quite like it did following these events. Anyway I\'m still a little scared about the prospect of war. I just hope America can hold back for a while until they have concrete proof of the offender\'s identity, that way maybe a war could be avoided. It looks bad though, with so many people crying for blood. I\'m a little ashamed with those people who are so narrow minded as to blame all people of the Muslim faith. That\'s existing racial hatred bubbling to the surface from my point of view, and it\'s amazing how many people have been harbouring it silently for all this time. It makes me sick.

'As a resident of Britain I was as appalled at what happened as anyone but I have to say that for years and years Irish Americans have supported the IRA who have killed and maimed people all over Britain.  I turst now that all assistance will cease or that the US government (which is out to stop all terrorism) will make it criminal to do so.  Perhaps they consider the IRA  freedom fighters  rather than Terrorists. I suppose that a terrorist is only such when one is on the other side.  During WWII the French underground were considered Freedom fighters by the allies but terrorists by the Axis powers and if Germany had won the war presumably we would now be taught that those Frenchmen and women were as evil in blowing up innocent German guards and workers as bin laden.to make a statement that they can be more committed to a cause than westernersnoneMuslim Extremists\"mental blindness, hate\"a group of terrorists of the Al Queda-networkno\"SAFETY EQUALITY FRATERNITY In my view the attacks of september 11 mark the transition of freedom from trhe political to the personal and communal domain.

Say hi to Robert Jensen.\"Islamic fundamentalists\"Realistic analyses, not stuck in political correctness, would indicate that many parts of Islam cannot deal with their failure as compared to the West. The glories of Islamic civilization faded when they turned from an open and compassionate civilization to one that was more concerned with  religion. As the west progessed, they stagnated. How to deal with this? Their religion trumpeted their superiority. Ah, the West must be evil. They ignore their own lack of fundamental freedoms and enslavement of women.  They also have been fixated on Israel as a cause for their problems. Clerics and governments need a scapegoat for their own failures. Who better to blame than the Jews.  So the fault, dear friends, is primarily in their court. The West has been its usual imperialist self but they failed to keep up with civilization, freedom and technology.

The patriotism is great, but probably won\'t last, so I would like to see Americans realize how complex international relations are.  The idea of good guys vs. bad guys will hopefully be replaced with a better understanding of the immense gray areas that have existed in the world since before WW II.\"I have been more vocal with my dissatisfication of the national media networks and their sensationalizing and tacky coverage.\"At first I couldn\'t believe it had happened, and like so many others, I had to keep looking at the news footage of the planes ploughing into the buildings to actually process that it was real and not a movie.  It seemed to me that those around me at work weren\'t as affected by it as I was. They seemed able to carry on doing what they would have done. People talked about it at morning tea, as we would have any other world event, but with some extra degree of gravity, but theire seemed to be a degree of separation from it which I couldn\'t achieve. I kept thinking of my own oung children, and of the number of people around my age (32) who had lost the chance to see their kids again. This was my most profound pain.   The news footage guided my reaction beacuse it was in many ways a reflection of the shared shock aorund the world, especially in those first days. The reporters seemed as shocked and dismayed as me, both here in Australia and in the US.  As the stories of loss emerged, I felt intense grief. I cried on and off for two weeks, and when each new story of loss, or heroism emerged, I felt that same pain again. The US telethon was especially moving. I taped it and I\'ve watch it again. Still I\'m moved. Like anyone, I tried also to understand how and why this had happened. I stayed up late those first days watching news...hanging out for each tiny piece of new information, and often not learning any more, just to piece together a picture of what happened and why. I came pretty close to the true picture quite quickly, which was no consolation of course.  My need to know made me search the internet for anything related to Bin Laden, or the middle east, or the events themselves. I knew that I needed to separate the human cost from what I know to be at least some of the reasons for why this has happened, and these are the attitudes held by the west, and the economic and military actions taken by the US, such as your support for Israel, or your sanctions against Iraq.  I keep thinking about the children, but I reminded myself that children are children everywhere in the world. Some comments since seem to indicate that people don\'t see it that way. A western life seems to be worth more than that of a third world child. Of course it should not be, but there is a power imbalance which makes it so. I struggle to separate the thoughts of the complex and somewhat tragic nature of man, of what war is and if it is ever just, of the dangers of self interest, nationalism, imperialism, fundamentalism...call them what you will, from the feelings of how completely wrong it is that a child, any child, should lose their parents, or that brothers and sisters should lose their own, or that parents should lose their children. It seems that war has been waged with innocents, and only innocents, caught in the middle, and that there is a danger that it will continue to be.  I also wonder if anyone I knew was there.  I still haven\'t heard of the names of the twenty or thirty Australians  missing. I need to see a list of those lost, with their names. Otherwise it seems as though they haven\'t been truly acknowledged. It seemed arrogant that Bush said,  The time for mourning is over.  I doubt if the families think that..but leaders will do that I suppose. They do what they think they need to do.  Perhaps humanity needs to be sustained by the leaders themselves. I know the world is changed forever.     \"\"I think that in their minds they see such acts as heroic, and they are convinced of their value in avenging or even changing the perceived injustices wrought by the US. I think someone at the top this netowrk has ulterior motives, be they economic, as with the stock market plunge before the strike, or political. Religion is a front at the top, but is used as motivation for the foot soldiers \"I cherish my kids more. I think I value my life more. I cry more. At times I\'ve been a bit short tempered too.\"It all points to a very organised, well funded, obviously committed Islamic terror organisation, but I\'m yet to see complete proof that it is Bin Laden\'s. I considered Iraq as well, since Bin Laden and Hussein have the same interest in getting the Us out of the gulf region.\"\"Probably Al Qayeda, but I\'d like all the evidence to be made public.  Also all of the world leaders who have failed to successfully resolve the Middle East problems and who are prepared to exploit despots out of self interest.\"\"Hatred, fuelled by living in a marginalized, underdeveloped society.\"\"I\'m a Canadian psychologist.  I had just returned home the previous night from a trip to the UK.  I probably caught the last flight to the west coast from Heathrow before the events happened.  I live in a small city halfway between the US border and Alaska, so it\'s off the beaten path.  When I turned on the TV in the morning was just after the second tower was hit.  My family was still asleep.  I watched in numbness for a while.  Then came the reports about Washington being struck.  Minutes later our cable went out.  It turned out it was due to a local accident, but my thought was, Holy shit.  This is continent-wide.   A few minutes later, I had to wake my kids and wife and I had to think in particular about how to prepare my kids.  Since the TV was out, we had to pull out a radio.  We were dumbstruck.  When the TV finally came back on, we just watched.  My son (18 years old) eventually said  That\'s the most fucked up thing I\'ve ever seen.   I teach at a small university.  When I got to work, everyone was just watching the many television sets located around the institution.  Some of the students were crying.  Nobody got anything done.  I\'m pretty sure I had the same set of reactions everyone else did in the days that followed.  The Saturday morning after, though, I awoke with my usual insomnia, and went downstairs to turn on the TV.  As I was watching the events, it suddenly occurred to me that I had been in contact a couple of weeks before with a good friend who used to work with me in Canada but returned to New Mexico a number of years ago.  What struck me was that in his last message, he had informed me that his son, who is a little older than mine, had made the goofy career choice of enlisting in the Navy.  We had exchanged a couple of humorous messages about the silly things he was hearing about boot camp.  Now, all of a sudden I realized that this kid, who used to play with my kids, could easily be on the front line soon, and I had to call my friend to just talk.  We had a great conversation and exchanged views on a bunch of things.  He asked me about my perspective as a non-American.  I said, I just hoped whatever the response it would be thoughtful.  I also remember being very angry the day after the attacks when the television broadcast George Bush from the Oval Office on the telephone, expressing concern to rescue workers and being congratulated on his leadership.  My thought was,  This is pure spin.   In the days and weeks since, I\'ve watched the events obsessively.  Although my political leanings are a little left-of-center, I have to agree that there is a need for some kind of assertive response, and I\'m pretty sure that that response will be as measured as it can be, so I\'m grateful about that.  On the other hand, one thing that really disturbs me is that I have seen little to no serious consideration by anyone with political influence to a question that was posed by one of the interviewers on Meet the Press or something.  The question was this:   Why do they hate us so much?  and I think it was addressed to Dick Cheney.  The question was never answered.  I think it\'s quite fundamental and all the military action and coalition building in the world won\'t help get to the root of it.  And until it\'s taken seriously, I think everyone\'s at risk.  What I worry about beyond that is my kids.  And I\'ve never been so grateful that I live off the beaten path.\"I\'m obsessed about following news events related to the attacks.  I think quite a bit about the impact on my kids and my American friends\' kids.I lost confidence in the human societyThis assault is the ultimate in horror and in human\'s perversity of thinking. To bring these killing cruelties and perversions in a context with any religion is against  any understanding of God. These animals are out of the human society and out of any scale of ethics. The human society has the right and the obligation to defeat such creatures without any hesitation in self defense.\"the perversion of an insane brain like found in Ben Laden, the talibans,the Nazis, any fanatics\"brain distortionIndoctrinated fanatics acting on orders in the belief they were doing an important and just thing. The responsible ones were those who indoctrinated them and told them what was to be done.\"I took several days off, and reduced my workload this week. I have spent more time than usual with friends and have read more fiction than usual. I have contributed to the relief effort\"\"It was an ingenious well planned attack that required months of planning and preparation, and years of indoctrination. Our country should have been more aggressive and consistent in seeking out and suppressing terrorists. We should have also been more vigilant about the risks posed by countries and religious or other groups who, like the Nazis and the imperial Japanese, take young people and indoctrinate them to become fanatics, so that as adults they can be called upon to do self destructive things willingly in the furtherance of the cause they have been trained to support. However, the last country to attack us which supported fanatical training paid the price in August, 1945. This should have been a warning for the present terrorists, but our country has, in recent years, been ashamed of this act which saved thousands of American and Japanese lives by bringing the war to a prompt close.\"\"They were trained in these beliefs since childhood, as were the HJ in Germany and the Kamikaze\"islamic fundamentalists\"My perspective is certainly different today from September 11. Then I was mainly shocked at the very sight of so many people dying, flying out of the windows etc. From then on I feel more connected to the otehr western countries, espcially to the U.S., which I felt quite distant and estranged from our reality, especially after the refusal to abide to the Kyoto protocol and weak action to solve the Middle East crisis, which is certainly linked to US. acritical support of Israel. Now I feell there is a possibility the US will better understand that they cannot be safe in a world where porvery and unjustice are so widely diffuse, that they cannot sustain a government just because it supplies them with oil, no matter where the money paid for the oil goes. On the otehr hand I feel that Europe can no more consider world terrorism as a problem involving only the US. I feel the western world has the possibility today of solving the problem of terrorism, that everyone may be confident that this event is not going to be forgotten and for this reason may act with calm and confidence of support. I certainly feel afraid that we might have attacks against european cities, but I do not believe the only poinnt is that my immediate neighbourhood is not involved: the point is if we change western attitude towards the rest of the world in the direction of greater responsibility.\"I listen more often to TV and read more newspapers\"the organizers are paranoid. The followers, including the kamikaze, are desperate people, coming from desperate countries where all values have been substituted by islamic fanatism \"Have I been more sober?  I think I am prone to that anyway.  Have I been more compassionate?  I am conscious of wanting to be.it seems logical that associates of bin Laden were responsible -- but of course it is impossible to say how widespread his influence is or if others would have acted on their own.\"a misplaced sense of righteousness. I think I understand some of the historical rationale they might have, most mostly I think it is a fundamentalist hatred of the sensual world and an envy that turns to insanity.\"\"I work in Soho and was in the subway when the attacks happened.  A young woman on the train said terrorists had attacked us.  What can you think about such Cassandra-like pronouncements?  But there it was and I and my colleages immediately went to the roof of our building to see the whole horrifying spectacle.  So many people have said it seemed like a movie, and it did.  Overwhelming disbelief.  From the beginning, as they sent us home, I felt that I wanted to be down there, running through the smoke.  Did I fantasize about overtaking the perpetrators and crushing them with my bare hands?  No.  The picture that came into my mind was the London Blitz, and what I wanted in my gut was to be immersed -- baptized, my childhood elders might have said -- in what was likely to be the most tragic occasion I would ever witness.  Part of this is that I am passionate about New York; part of it is a result of my generation\'s odd sort of guilt at being spared the deprivations of our parents and of war.  As the day passed and my friends and I phoned around and ascertained that everyone in our circle was safe, I felt -- I think we all did -- a kind of aching numbness.  I won\'t say I felt cheated by being spared a direct hit on a loved one, but I felt I wanted to grieve more deeply and actively than I was capable of.  And still I wanted to be a part of it, not just as history but as a hit on our city.  Funny, too, how many New Yorkers think of the attack as a hit on the city more than as a hit on the country, even given the attack on the Pentagon.  This is an emotional thing, not an intellectual one.  There is probably not one person in Oklahoma City who shook their fist after the Murrah Building bombing and said,  They can\'t do this to Oklahoma City!   But I think we took this personally. I know that if I were not in New York when this happened, I would not be able to stand it, I would need to be here.  To this day I feel bereft that I was not able to stand on the pile and do something for somebody.\"no change\"I heard the news from a collegue at 4 pm (10 am New York time). My first reaction was one of disbelief, followed by a feeling of anxiety about what else was to follow. I was not able to continue working, so I went home and watched various tv channels (mainly CNN) from 5 to 7 pm. By then the situation had become clear, and my feelings had changed to anger about such a senseless act of violence against innocent and unsuspecting people. I tried to figure out against whom my anger should be directed, and quickly became convinced that this was an act of war against democracy and freedom, committed by zealous muslim terrorists, probably backed by anti-American governements like Irak and Afghanistan. This anger and thoughts about how to find and punish those responsible continue until this day. During the rest of the day (Sept. 11) and the following day I listened to the radio, read newspaper reports and watched tv with very mixed feelings, varying from grief, sorrow and disbelief to anger and revenge.\"\"I can find no positive arguments whatsoever, only negative destructive ones like hate and intolerance\"\"probably zealous muslims, blinded by an unmeasurable intolerance of other points of view and hatred against western societies\"Don\'t know\"Not much, other than as described above\"Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda\"My first response, upon hearing of the attacks, was  who are these cowardly rat bastards? . As the atrocity unfolded, and it is an atrocity, I was somewhat numb and unbelieving. Then as the enormity of the events became more and more clear, I became angry, but resolute, in that I cannot believe that this country,as should many countries,will let this dastardly, nay, Hitler-like deed go unpunished. Rather than a like response, once responsibility is known beyond a reasonable doubt, then crush them. Women and children did not conceive, plan and execute this. Were I younger, I would immediately volunteer. I retired from US  military service after almost 28 years.\"Osama bin Laden and his organization.\"That night I was horrified by the terrorist attack. As I reflected more, however, I was horrified at our lack of preparation for such an event, by our lack of good intelligence, and by not understanding the mindset of the terrorists, the Arab/Muslim world, and the jealousy of other nations. I now think that any military action has to have very definite aims, a strategy for using force, and an anticipation of reprisals. I could write lots more, but the bottom line is that the wounds will heal -- but the underlying situation will not, unless it is thought through and addressed. How did Forest Gump become President of these United States?\"They think they are acting in the right (and maybe only) way.No change',4,-5,0,2,5,1.86,1.87,0,0,0.62,0,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,9.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.24,0,0.62,0,0,0,0,4.66,4.66,0,0,2.8,1.24,0,0,2.49,0,0,0,2.49,0,0,0,0,34.18,0,1.56,0,1.24,0,0,0.62,0,47.24,4.35,0,3.42,0,1.87,0,0,0,1.86,0,1.24,0,0,0,13.98,13.06,2.49,0.62,0,0,4.97,0,0.62,0.62,0,0,0,0,0.62,0,0.31,3.11,Male
'no changeOsama bin Laden\"Range of emotions. Initially stunned at the unreality of it all. There was a definite wow factor about the spectacular pictures we were  seeing. The initial \'thrill\' was replaced by both sadness for the  victims and rage at the perpetrators,and, it has to be said, great  antipathy towards islam and all it\'s adherents. So much so that was  quite willing for US govt to launch immediate strikes against whoever  they felt was responsible (Normally, I would consider myself more of a dove than a hawk). As the days have passed this feeling of rage has subsided somewhat.  Not so sure bombing Afghanistan to damnation will help. Throughout it all I have been soaking up any information from tv  and the newspapers trying to get a handle on what happened and also because it is the only thing that everyone has been talking about. Even though I was not directly invovled in this event (I was thousands  of miles away, I know none of the victims), I took it personally. \"out of a warped sense of injusticeEverybody.\"I feel like everyone should be nicer to each other, chill out, and quit acting on hate.\"\"They had motive, beliefs that cater to this action, and opportunity.\"\"I think it\'s sick that people could do that to other people -- kill ordinary folks going about their day.  But I also think the U.S. has to figure out why those involved committed such violent acts.  That is, there is all too likely some sort of motive and the U.S. should quetion its relations such as foreign policy.  Of course, even if our foregin policy is so oppressive to those people I do not think killing U.S. citizens is a rational and useful strategy for overturning whatever negative components of U.S. policy, society, or culture angers or oppresses those people.  We may need to rethink ourselves, and those involved, if they are indeed Islamic, may need to reassess jihad.  The Islamic community may also need to label the perpretrators of these events as a  cult  and not a typical representative of the religion.  Although I question the U.S., I also question the terrorists and am hurt by it.  It has birthed a new sense of patriotism within me as well as a sadness and a feeling of real vulnerability.\"\"What can I say, the media has said, it must be Bin Laden. I truly think the people who flew the planes were a group of people that did it on their own, but there may have been links too Islamic extremism\"\"Frustrated with the world, its about time that we should be able to make the best world as possible.   getting aware of the power of the media, in any country.\"\"They are truly brainwashed.. the terrorists.  Do not kill innocent people in uS hunt for terrorists. But do prosecute the correct people that did this cruel act. Fight terrorism. US interferance in international affairs, in all cases, can be somewhat provocative.

They are disoriented. Sad, but true,  black and white thinking . Can\'t help it.  Too much TV \"\"I\'m interested in telling you my perspective but I\'ve been a bit overwhelmed with the attack and the media newscoverage ao I\'m not sure where to begin. First I\'m angry. I\'m angry at the lax security measures that weren\'t in place, I\'m angry at the fact that we have known  suspected  terrorists in our country which weren\'t deported, I\'m angry at crazy religious fanatics, I\'m angry at the politicians who are using this as an excuse to gain the media spotlight, I\'m angry at the airlines - the money grubbing SOB\'s they are. They don\'t want to spend money on security and now they lay off thousands of employees and get our tax dollars to keep them afloat...and the list goes on and on. AND I\'m angry at the media coverage. I\'m angry at the blood-lust that American\'s have for revenge....Thank god we didn\'t go over there with guns blazing and kill so many inocents - what good would that do. Where does my anger end? The other thing is that I\'m quite shocked how much this event has affected me. I\'m presently writing a disseration and freaked out anyway over the deadlines and then this happens and takes me totally off track. I haven\'t slept well since it happened...and I know it\'s because of the attack because I dream about it every night - not nightmares but general  processing  dreams, like if I were in charge I would do such and such...I\'m glued to the T.V. Plus I\'m going to NYC for a conference in a couple of weeks and I\'m concerned over what that will be like. I\'m basically unsure exactally how I feel...other than I\'m angry...I want revenge too but not at the cost of killing innocents and going to war. I don\'t want to be in fear of traveling...I\'m tired.\"Just watching too much television.I have never quite understood the religious fanatic mentality. It is so hard to understand. Could someone be so psycholocially warped that they would do something like this? I want to read about the psyche of such individuals. Pretty scarry what religion - and probably classifiable mental defect can do to someone.\"This is an interesting question...at first glance it would be Ben Landen, but on a deeper level is it our US policy regarding Israel and the Middle East? I haven\'t followed our countries policies and histrical dealing in the Middle East but it\'s a vicious cycle when American get involved in such conflict between religious factions. But definately more fault on the actual terrorist group that did it.\"\"well i told all of my family that i loved them more often, and i try to take advantage of every day because you will never know when it will be your last\"because they are jealous of our country and how it is run\"When i first heard the news about the attacks, i was sitting in my  introduction to humanities  class with my classmates. we were waiting for out teacher to arrive, but by 9:50, people were beginning to leave. around that time, one of my classmates got a two way page on their nextel, and somebody told him that the twin towers were attacked. he shared the news with the rest of us. we reacted in shock and disbelief.  the counselor finally came to the class to tell us that classes were cancelled because our teacher lives in manhattan and couldnt make it.  mamy of us stood behind to talk about what had happened, many of us sad, scared, shocked and concerned.  after our discussion, i went to the computer lab to see the news, and to check my email. i was flooded with phone calls and instant messages, i felt so loved.  on my way home, the buses were packed, because the trains were closed. the bus was silent, and people looked shocked.  when i got home i watched the news for the rest of the day, and the following day. i was in such shock and disbelief still.  the events that occured on september 11th, 2001 will be forever burned into our memories. i was deeply affected as were my peers, eventhough many of us hadn\'t lost someone we love. i was shocked, saddened, angry and upset. my heart goes out to everyone who was affected, and people who lost family members. it is truly a tragic and senseless act. \"bin laden\"I have thrown myself into my work. I am a GA at a large midwestern University. I have helped launch a network of teachers in my department  who want to study these tragedies, what led to them, and what the fallout will be. We are also working together to integrate  our questions, and America\'s questions, and the World\'s  questions into the classroom. \"\"So many people in so many places.

So if my feelings could be expressed briefly I would say that I have fortunately not lost faith in this country, and this world to improve itself. Despite all the drum beating and war rhetoric, I believe that there are enough people out there who are capable and willing to explore more critical approaches to our world\'s future. We have a lot of work to do to make the world a safer place for all of  its citizens, but I believe that it can be done. \"Different sides have different reasons.

Bad dreams, not spending much time with my wife, watching the news all the time, crying many times a day.  As a direct result of this attack I got drunk for the first time in over two months.  Two months was a milestone for me--I had not stayed sober that long in years.  After getting drunk twice, I am now sober again.\"\"These remarks are taken from three messages I wrote in the usenet newsgroup talk.politics.mideast. THE BIN LADEN VIDEOTAPES I have come across several references to some videotapes that are supposedly passed around among arabs in the middle-east produced by Bin Laden expressing his views and attempting to gain support among people of the arab-speaking world.  At the bottom of this message are some links to webpages describing tapes that are released by Bin Laden.  Most appear to talk about a nine-minute tape released in June of this year, but one page ( http://www.rense.com/general11/vid.htm ) talks about a 100 minute tape--however the dateline of this story is 21Jun, the same date of the other stories about a nine minute tape.  Even so,  I have formed the impression that there might be a number of these tapes that are passed around. To what degree, if any, does the religion of Islam--right or wrong--play a role in the motivation of these terrorists?  Many muslims are saying that these terrorists are not true muslims, but the terrorists themselves seem to feel that they are. Whoever it is that did this, they still have not released an explanation, or list of demands, or anything.  What do they want?  What are their goals? What do they have planned next?  Do they really commit these attacks on the west because, as our leaders are saying lately,  they hate our way of life ? No matter how much I hated another country\'s way of life, I cannot imagine that I could ever convince myself that hijacking airliners and killing 7,000 civilians would accomplish anything other than making the world a worse place.  It seems to me there must be more specific reasons than  they hate our way of life  or  they hate liberty  or any of these other obviously inadequate explanations that are being parroted by so many talking heads these days.  If we understood how they think, we might be able to predict what their next target is.  The better we understand them, the more likely we will defeat them. I, for one, would like very much to know exactly what is on these videotapes.  Are there any arabic speaking people who have access to these tapes who would be willing to translate their contents into english and create either written transcripts or english-subtitled versions of these videos for the rest of us who are trying very hard to understand what is happening and what is coming next? http://seattlep-i.nwsource.com/national/28167_binladen20.shtml http://www.rense.com/general11/vid.htm http://www.azzam.com/html/newsoblvideo.htm http://asia.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/06/21/video.binladen/index.html http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/binladen010620_video.html http://www.dailytelegraph.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,2156976,00.html http://www.smh.com.au/news/0106/21/world/world9.html http://www.thesundaymail.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,2156976,00.html long profile of bin laden: http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-091501osama.story  ANYBODY BUT ME REMEMBER THE ENERGY CRISIS?

All these people who bitch about the Evil American Imperialism in the middle east act like our CIA did the bad shit for fun, like OPEC never, in a not-too-subtle way, once tried to wag the dog.  Maybe they brought some of that  oppressive foreign policy  shit down on their own heads, huh? Hollywood or no, Higgin\'s speech at the end of  3 Days of the Condor  has a certain brass truth to it.  Don\'t bother asking Joe Blow what he thinks U.S. Foreign Policy should be in the Middle East now.

THE CIA AND THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY CRUSADES   Bin Laden calls Muslims to arms     Tuesday, September 25, 2001 at 09:30 JST     Osama bin Laden urged Muslims to fight  the new Jewish Crusader   campaign     We are firm on the road of jihad (holy war),  the multimillionaire   Islamic militant was quoted as saying by Qatar\'s al-Jareeza   television.    The new Jewish Crusader campaign is led by the biggest crusader Bush   under the banner of the cross,  I told ya so.  On 13September I said,  I am beginning to think that what the terrorists of 11Sep REALLY wanted was to bring back the Crusades, to bring back the war of Christianity against Islam.  All you Explainers and Terrorist Sympathizers think that the poor third worlders would just join hands with us in brotherhood and love if the darn CIA wasn\'t fucking everything up with evil U.S. Foreign Policy.  Although there is some truth to that, you don\'t acknowledge the truth that many of those third-worlders would happily do away with America if they could, and they would not lose a night\'s sleep over it.  They would be happy to eat our lunch, and some of them do design our death. You think Conspicuous Consumerism is bad?  Shit, every thirdworlder on this planet would give his left NUT to own an SUV and eat Big Macs all day long and the rainforest be damned!  I\'m not saying it\'s right, but let\'s not elevate these people to some level of Rousseauian nobility that they *just don\'t have*.  I think the movie  Baraka  is an important and exquisite statement of what it is to be human, but even so, I still lock my fucking doors at night... Conservatives and Right-wingers and the CIA and Big Business are the biggest monsters you can conceive of.  You think the most awful thing in the world is some rich white guy wielding foreign policy in the CIA, the State Department or the boardroom of some Multinational Corporation.  The worst thing you can imagine is America, abusing it\'s power and brutalizing your poor, innocent comrades in rice paddies and rainforests around the world, who would be grooving with you at a Phish concert if only the Secret Corporate Government would stop rigging the game with torture and mind control. I too saw things this way, once upon a time.  I used to let God and School and Parents think for me.  When I realized what a chump I was being, I became outraged and so then I let Pink Floyd and Abbie Hoffman and Jello Biafra and Noam Chomsky et. al. think for me.  But I came to recognize that it was the same puppet show with different puppets. When he saw the  QUESTION AUTHORITY  bumpersticker, Robert Anton Wilson\'s reply was,  SAYS WHO?!   At this point, I wanted R.A. Wilson to think for me, but he turned the job down.  So finally, I am stuck with ME thinking for me.  It sucks, and it\'s a shit job, but *somebody\'s* gotta do it. I\'ve got some bad news for you, sunshine.  There ARE other monsters in the world, ones we don\'t own and operate, and these are the guys responsible for some (or maybe most) of the torture, brutality and injustice around the world that upsets you so much.   But what about The School of the Americas! , you say.  You think the U.S. Army can turn an ordinary person into a torturer?  The South Americans who went to that school had to already have that disposition if you ask me.  We Americans are certainly guilty of making these monsters worse, but I do not believe that we alone solely created all of them in the first place.  But if they were predisposed to that kind of sociopathy, it is only because of the horrific conditions created by American Neo-Colonial Exploitation and Oppression of the social environment they grew up in!  Killers who grew up in poverty aren\'t the guilty ones, the guilt belongs on the heads of rulers of Big Business, it\'s not the fault of the killers, they were disadvantaged by a horrific environment as children blah blah blah blah.   Sorry, no sale. I believe in personal responsibility.  If I do you wrong, I  expect you to hold ME responsible, not my childhood environment, neighborhood, parenting, or anything else.  These theories that people are not responsible for their own actions are utter bullshit.  Let\'s all disavow personal responsibility and then we can do anything we want!  Gimme that car!  I want your woman, you gotta die  BLAM   BLAM !  Hey sorry judge!  It was MY ENVIRONMENT THAT DID IT, NOT ME!!!  Riiiight.   Only a lad, you really can\'t blame him, only a lad, society made him...  ah, oingo boingo... love those crazy tunes! If you truly believe America is the font from which all of the evil in the world flows, I can only look at you and shake my head and hope that you don\'t just shut your eyes and stop learning.  It would be nice if the world was that simple a place, but it\'s not. Are the CIA a bunch of monsters?  Certainly.  That\'s what we pay them for. They do a job that you bleeding-hearts don\'t have the stomach for.  They do a lot of terrible shit, and a lot of it is certainly wrong and done for big business.  I never said I thought Chomsky was wrong, I said he irritates me, because while he has a million complaints, he doesn\'t seem to have *one* real answer on how things SHOULD be run, and neither do the rest of you fuckin whining Explainer/Sympathizers.  Of all the Explainer/Sympathizers who are trying to blame the Media, or the Intelligence Community or U.S. Foreign Policy or the Repulicans, Conservatives, Limbaugh/Buchanan, Falwell/Robertson--Ogres all--I have not heard ONE bit of constructive advice from any Explainer/Sympathizer.  They want to armchair quarterback the most powerful country in the world, and they don\'t even have the balls to say how THEY would run the show if they could.  I will now quote Sgt. Barnes, the villian from the movie  Platoon :  There\'s the way things ought to be and there\'s the way things are.  World War II is over, and WE won. NOT somebody else.  AMERICA. If the world doesn\'t like the way we run things, maybe they should have fucking FOUGHT HARDER. (Incidentally, I don\'t mean to ignore our friends and allies the Brits in this, nor our other NATO allies who also fought and sacrificed and also won. I am only trying to answer a body of critics who appear to hate America.) This is not a Dr. Seuss world and it never will be.  Now Bin Laden is trying to revive the crusades among the radical fundamentalists of the Muslim world.  Again, I\'m not an expert, but I\'ve read a little bit about the crusades, and you Sympathizer/Explainers had better hope to God that the Muslims don\'t start THAT shit back up again.  And yes, I know the Christians started it last time. You worry that we are too much monsters.  I pray that we are monsters enough. You call me Hitler, a racist, a terrible person.  You think I don\'t care, but believe it or not, those words go right to the bone.  I know *exactly* what awful thing I am promoting here.  I\'ll wager that I know it better than you.  And I do have a conscience despite what you think, and I am not stupid, regardless of what you would like to believe.  So you might try to broaden your world view to account for me, so that you can continue to play a role in my thinking and the thinking of others like me, because we are not going to just let YOU run the show.  At some point, we will begin to play a role.  The cheap insults don\'t sway us to your way of thinking, so you\'d better come up with something else. Or just keep ignoring us as ineffectual, and leave us to our own devices, and see what the future brings. -- rotflmao7d1  Show me a young conservative and I will show you a man with no heart.

Until recently, nations such as China and others were critizing the monopolar global structure anchored in the USA.  Now the USA has justification for deepening and strengthening the monopolar structure through the development of more active commitments and support from more nations.  This makes the somewhat implicit monopolarity more explicit and manifest.  Expanding police powers on a global scale should make for a long-term increase in global stability.

Sep 11th was a day we where trying to get information from the Internet to find out if a world war would break out within the next hours. Of course, I now think I reacted too excited. My impression was, that, though I\'m not working in WTC, that it aimed at me. I\'m a consultant at Vodafone, and as unlikely as it still is, I feel like one of the targets. I do not feel in fear, and I did not a Sep 11th. O.K., my first sentence was  things have become more clear . I think we know what we stand for, and we know by now, that we will choose other means to defend these goals. On Sep 11th, I would have understood if Arabia or Mekka would have been bombed within hours. I still think a simple argument for our way to see things more cool, is, that a natural response would have been to erase Mekka. That would have been simple, but I would have understood that (though it would be wrong).

I am very uncomfortable with the  fact that some people have views and belief systems so vastly different from mine that they can feel honored to have murdered thousands of strangers with whom they had no specific quarrel. I don\'t believe these individuals are  crazy  in the typical sense, but I find their way of thinking incomprehensible. I am also very sad for the tremendous personal losses represented in this tragedy.  The countless children who lost parents, and the wives who lost husbands, and vice versa.

As a human tragedy, these events should motivate us to value and appreciate the people and relationships in our lives.  Any of us, and anyone close to us, could be gone at any time, for any number of reasons, so let\'s take care of each other while we\'re here. 2. America is a great country, but it\'s not perfect and never has been.  Righteous anger is one thing, but self-righteousness is another.  We\'re not better than others, just better off.  Forgetting that only provokes the kind of hatred that we saw on Sept. 11.  A little humility please!!! 3. People are people, regardless of what part of the world they or their ancestors came from.  Everyone has good and bad qualities, and some are more evident than others at different times ... and it has ALWAYS been that way (at least since Adam and Eve ate the wrong fruit).  We need to treat people as individuals and actions as actions, not condemn whole groups with  they\'re all alike . 4. There must and will be a military response to this, but let\'s not play into the hands of the fanatics and give them the  holy war  that they\'ve said they want.  Let\'s be careful out there! 5. As a nation, we need to reconsider our choice of friends.  Remember Noriega?  Better yet, remember Stalin?  Are the Saudis really the kind of people we want to be associated with?  And who do we think put Saddam Hussein in power in the first place?  (Think of 3 initials.)  WAKE UP!!!  We\'ve sown the wind, and we\'re reaping the whirlwind. 6.  Don\'t even get me started on abortion.  Just do the math. 7.  I still feel safer on a plane than I do on the streets and highways of the Chicago area.  Again, you do the math. 8.

Fearful.I do not know.\"Sep-28-2001. I remain shocked by the tragic and devastating events of Sep-11-2001. I cannot concentrate on things I need to focus on (e.g. work). I find it hard to watch TV or have a chat with my family/friends/colleagues without the events invading my mind. It will be a long time before I\'m able to step on a plane. Also, because I\'m a brown person (Indian ancestry) I\'m now afraid to enter the US, fearing attacks because of the color of my skin. I have relatives in Kentucky and Texas and my sister lives in Florida. Under normal circumstances, I would\'ve flown or driven to meet them. Now, I do not know if and when I will enter the US again. My heart goes out to the victims on the planes and in the WTC and Pentagon. I cannot bear to think what their families are going through. At times, I\'m on the verge of breaking into tears. I\'m beginning to think that the tragic events have caused me to become depressed. On the plus side, my eyes have been opened to the suffering of people in other parts of the world (e.g. the Palestinian people). I\'m beginning to believe the attacks represented the agonizing cry of the Arab people for justice and freedom. It was like the sufferers were lashing out at a world that merely looks on without lending a helping hand. The world needs to address injustice all over our planet. We need to help the Arab world towards democracy, human rights, freedom and justice. For now, we cannot defeat terrorism. Terrorism has always existed and will continue to exist in our current world of injustice and inequality. But, we can reduce terrorism or contain it; we can do this by reducing injustice and inequality and consequently reducing hatred. When I see the disaster that is Palestine, Afghanistan and many less-fortunate parts of the world, I cannot help but hang my head in shame. How can we (in more fortunate parts of the world) ignore the human tragedy that these situations constitute? \"',3,-5,0,2,5,1.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.15,1.15,0,1.15,0,10.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.19,0,0,0,2.31,3.45,1.15,0,1.15,0,0,0,0,1.15,1.15,0,0,38.63,0,1.15,0,0,0,0,2.3,0,45.53,4.62,0,3.46,0,0,0,0,0,3.45,0,0,0,0,0,20.18,6.9,1.15,1.73,1.15,0,9.22,0,0,1.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.15,1.15,Male
'\"The attacks on Sept. 11th were both frightening and eye opening.  I was on my way to school with my girlfriend and we heard that New York was being attacked.  We were listening to Mancow so it seemed just like a joke at 1st.  Then we checked other radio stations and found out that the attack was real.  We walked into school and saw what was happening.  It was totally sir-real.  We completley lost our innocence that day.  Ever since then the world has changed and all you see on T.V. is terrorist this and terrorist that.  It sucks.  I know other countries have it way worse than us, but attacking us to make us realize that is ridiculious.  The whole arab holy war thing going on over there is so unlike here.  I mean honestly how can you expect kids to know or care anything about it??  Bin Laden is a crazy fool and I hope he gets what he deservers.

These people who did these acts are brainwashed in this hoax of a religion and the leader they obey every word.

Which will be destruction\"Desparate, brainwashed people who are jealous of what we have in the U.S.\"Not taking anything nor anyone for granted.  Alot more knowledgeable of the world news.I would guess that there is a generation of angry young Middle Eastern men who see very little hope for a better life for themselves and their countrymen under the status quo.  They probably don\'t have much to lose by committing suicide. \"There\'s more than enough responsibility to go around.  I do not wish to absolve the terrorists of responsibility for their actions.  However, I feel the greater responsibility lies with American corporations and their  employees  in government (that is, virtually all U.S. politicians), for their support for the indefensible actions of Israel, their systematic exploitation of most of the world\'s people, and their indiscriminate use of violence to maintain global inequality.  Of course, that means that the American people are also responsible, since we tolerate this behavior in our name.  \"\"I\'ve gone to two meetings and participated in live and e-mail discussions with people whose political views are similar to my own.  We primarily talked about the dangers facing the country, and how we might take action to halt the mindless march toward war. \"\"My first thoughts were about the victims--the kinds of suffering they must have experienced, and whether I knew any of them.  (I grew up in northeastern NJ, so this was a realistic possibility.) Since that time I\'ve experienced a lot of anger, not so much at the terrorists as at the U.S. government, the media, and my fellow citizens, for their jingoism and their failure to think seriously about the reasons for the attack.  I feel American prosperity is largely based on systematic exploitation of the resources and labor of poor countries.  Even worse is American foreign policy, which attempts to maintain these inequalities by military force.  I\'m troubled by the shallowness of most people\'s understanding of American foreign policy. I also want to add that I\'m fearful.  I\'m not sure our national leaders are competent to deal with the crisis.  I\'m afraid we\'re going to respond, as we have in the past, by killing large numbers of innocent people, which will of course help to recruit more terrorists, leading to a vicious cycle of increasing hostility.  We were  fortunate  that this attack was by mechanical means.  It\'s troubling to think about how easy it would be for a terrorist to smuggle a biological or nuclear weapon into a crowded area.   \"I try to break the fear that my wife has of the worldthird world countries/with leaders that have had a taste of capitilistic ways .predijuce\"I feel a bit lonely but most of all i feel angry. I am angry that innocent people were killed, but also at the USA . We in the USA use and abuse the people and the environment of the world. We dont want to change our ways. Yes I am very upset at the violent acts that took place on sept 11 but we as a nation must look at how we progress. Are we going to avenge our people with  an eye for an eye ? or will we change some of our ways to benifit the planet. We use over 50\% of the Earth\'s natural resources .

To explain the first word, I must tell you that I\'ve lived in Manhattan for a year (98-99).  Being Greek I was delighted to see how friendly the people were and how civilized.  I expirienced the feeling of meritocracy, politeness, justice and order.  I always thought that that city was the safest place on earth-that\'s why this attack was so shocking.  I needen\'t describe the feeling of horror and pain that filled my heart while watching the dissaster endless times on TV.  And then I had to call my friends who live there, to see...if they still live!   To describe the second word, I have to go back to New Yorkers in 1999 and look at their dark side.  There was also a feeling that people whould do anything for money-that the $100 bill was their God.  People there were minding their own business, so much that they were not  citizens  with the ancient Greek meaning of the word.Citizen- Politis  from  polis  the town and then politics-well I don\'t have to translate this one.  A citizens duty is to be involved in politics, in other words to have a saying for what his  polis  does because he is part of it and he forms its existence.  That\'s why we have elections.  And although Americans were involved and concerned with what was going on in their country, they had no concern of what was going on outside America.  Now the catch is that the US goverment has been a major player in the rest of the world since world war 2.  In numerous discussions about American foreign policy, the American people whould refer to their goverment as  they  not  we  showing a chasma between the  two  (when it should be one). America is too far away , I myself felt that America is a different world, so far away from the rest of it-like a different planet!  A world power is always going to have a lot of enemies and friends-it cannot stay nutral.  Being a major player demands participation in all games.  One of the enemies was crazy enough to commit this massaker of inocent people-people that can be critisized for one thing only:  Not being involved and concerned about their  Polis\'s  foreign policy.  That\'s where the bitterness comes from-such a shame! Coming to the third word, I\'m puzzeld.  I\'ve been watching CNN for 14 days.  There are discussions about what happend, how, where, when, who did it, what the conseqences are and what America and the rest of the civilized world is doing about it.  No one asked why.  And if someone did the answer was: crazy, fanatics, lunatics, non-human.  I will agree with that answer, but it\'s just not good enough. What we should do about it: Fight terrorism?-yes! Even if it takes a full scale war?-yes! American people being more concerned about foreign policy?-yes! Put justice before interest?-yes! Divert moneys from military budget into humanitarian budget?-yes! Finally I want to remind or introduce people to a golden rule:   What goes around comes around.  Love to be loved, respect to be respected, help to be helped. Brothers and sisters, let\'s pray to our Lord Jesus Christ and to His Father, Father of all religions, the one and only God to guide us through this ordeal\"\"Not convinced that it is Osama bin Laden, but he does seem reasonable suspect.\"\"Unfortunately, an event like this should not have been too unexpected.

As I watched --glued to the t.v., it felt like I was watching a television show, waiting for the minute by minute updates, waiting for the conclusion of the story..of course with a pre-determined ending where the  good guys  win. Some of this was fueled by the media\'s presentation:  America Under Attack ,  complete with dramatic music, special effects, reporters on the scene, interviews with every retired general they could find, opinions from reporters  here, there, everywhere.

That SO many people were left grieving. That SO many people were traumatised vicariously (seeing it live or soon after) That it could happen there (NY) really does mean that it could happen anywhere; and that the unpredictability and randomness of it means that I feel threatened here in Sydney. That humans could do this to others! And that they think that it is acceptable for any reason (including a Jihad) is too hard to beleive; therefore I conclude that the instigator(s) are motivated be personal pathology (e.g. narcisstistic self-righteous drive for attention and leadersgip) That certain commercial and foreign policies and attitudes of successive governments in America (including the linking of Nationalism and religion:  we are a good Christian God-fearing nation )have made so many nations loathe America and what it stands for. ... and that this is no a powerful and fanderous internation hatred that could fuel further violence. That an armed retaliation will only deepen these hostilities and perpetuate the hate that commenced the vioelnce in the first place.

The real responsibility lies with a small handful of individuals who no doubt possesthe following attributes: they command a degree of authority and respect; they utilise a degree of religious mandate; have access to LOTS of money; ability to give people the conviction that they are doing the right thing; have no sense of respect for other\'s lives or humanity (sociopathy) I understand that BinLaden is considered a suspect and this seems very likely, although it could well be others??\"Osama Bin Laden and his helpers.I now have re-current dreams about the attacks and I feel greatley sad about this.

I feel violated because I grew up in the shadow of the towers as a young man.  I watched them grow and understood the importance and significance of their presence in the New York skyline.  I feel as if someone has broken into my home and attempted to take away my home and my livelihood, my friends and my family.  It angers me in that although these attacks may not have been avoided, it is apparent that our ability to identify individuals and groups capable of this kind of act has deminished since the cold war and terrorism has not been taken seriously because it has not been identified with a specific nation but rather individuals who we thought incapable of this level of terror.  We have underestimated the enemy and the result is massive loss of life and property.  There is no front line and there is no identified nation and hence our approach to dealing with terrorism must change and yet I don\'t know that it will.  You would think from our experiences in WW II in the pacific and the war in Vietnam that we would realize that battlelines are not always specifically defined.  In Vietnam the enemy was among us.  The young barber cutting hair during daylight hours was the enemy sniper tied to a tree taking American lives under darkness.  So to with terrorist.  They find there way into our society and becaome responsible citizens by day and destroy life and property by night.  When fighting terrorism we must take a gorilla warfare approach to dealing with this enemy and I am angry that our leaders have not understood this and taken appropriate action in dealing with the problem.  My fear now is that we here in the US are so infiltrated by these terrorist that identifying them will be even more difficult than before.  The time for passive/aggressive approaches is over.  We can no longer take the approach that if we know who they are and where they are that we can control their ultimate intents and outcomes.  We must take an aggressive approach to this problem.\"The world powers who refused to address this issue vigorously prior to this event.Strong and manical committment to their religous and polical beliefs and opposition to those who believe otherwise.\"Up to this point not much since the numbness has yet to wear off.

Its life-long self-oriented and egoistic policy will cause more and more that kind of attacks in the future, and the people of the USA will probably just wonder why, because it is a totally incomprehensible thing for US (not American, you really are not the whole continent) people that there could be someone in this world who doesn\'t LOVE the good ol\' US of A. USA is a country, population of which makes up 5\% of the population of the whole world, they use 1/3 of all natural resources and produce 1/2 (yeah, half) of all the garbage, waste and litter of the world. It is also the only country in the world, which has such things as a Hamburger University and the University of the Paranormal. That explains the curious fact, how on earth it is possible that there are University Graduates in the USA. These things  should ring the bell in the minds of the US people, but no: as long as there is Coke and the Disneyland and the cars consume 12 litres (if you don\'t know how many gallons that is, it\'s your problem) on 100 km(- -in miles) on average, everything must be well in The Land of the Free, where prisons are filled with people under eighteen and where death-sentence is in active use. \"\"Well, um, let\'s see.... Last time when there was a terrorist attack in you good ol\' country (The Home of the Brave), a muslim named Osama Bin Laden was accused of it for the first two weeks after the incident. Well, the fact that the person responsible for the car bomb later turned to be a white, young, christian male citizen of your own country (the Bold one), can\'t probably teach anything to anyone this time, can it?  Last ones to be suspected are, of course, the people who would most benefit from the western worlds\' condemnation of the islamic countries and who would very much like to see the attention of the worlds\' media to turn away from their nazi-comparable internal policy. But, because you (the Free) have armed, fed and equipped them for half a century, it wouldn\'t be very nice to tell the taxpayers that they have actually financed the WTC-attack themselves, you\'d better find the guilty party from more comfortable direction.

'\"I watch, listen to and read international news so much more.\"Terrorists - I can\'t say where the chain of history throught the centuries really points the finger\"I was sitting at my desk at work around lunchtime in London.  I work in an open plan office, and way down the office I heard a co-worker say a plane had crashed into the Twin Towers.   For some reason, perhaps not wanting to think of anything bigger, I assumed it was a light aircraft, like a traffic news plane.  However, news began to spread across the office, to the point where I began to feel like it was some stupid, tasteless \'rumour\' story.  Around 4.00pm, somebody said the Pentagon had collapsed.  I decided to run home and find out the truth from my tv.  I recall walking across the park to where I live, watching commercial aircraft approaching London\'s airports.  I couldn\'t shake the feeling that they were all flying too low. Televisual images of horrors across the world have, I fear, numbed me to the realities they depict.  Only the previous week I had watched with detachment the images of little kids and their parents being threatened by jeering crowds as they tried to get to school in Belfast.  Watching the terrified reactions of children as a pipe bomb exploded close by left me frowning, a little troubled but resigned to the ongoing troubles in Northern Ireland.  Yet, watching the scenes of devastation in New York and Washington, watching the recordings of the second plane impacting the tower, and then the buildings collapse, I found my single thought was the people.  People in the planes, the buildings, and the street below.  I was watching recordings of people dying.  This has stayed with me days since. I\'ve travelled by plane so many times, internationaly and domestically in the US.  I\'ve worked in tall buildings.  I sit now in a fairly tall building, my computer, my telephone, the typical bits and pieces of office life.  I can look out the window across other buildings to London\'s \'sky-scrapers\', Canary Wharf.  I\'ve thought about the moments for people before the horrors began. But, in the end, it\'s too much to imagine, to dwell upon.  So I and many of my friends and colleagues get on with our lives.  I\'m an actor by profession.  On the evening of Tuesday 11th, I attended a first screening of a short film in which I appear.  I sat in a movie theatre with other viewers.  I drank wine at the reception afterwards.  I discussed business with people.  My point is that life just went on, however tainted or shaken by that days events in the US. On tv I watched the parents of a British man who had died on one of the planes.  He and his parents come from my home town.  He went to the same school as my brother-in-law.  His parents spoke and I imagined my own parents, similar in age, talking in much the same way.  The man\'s mother, though deeply shocked, said something that has stayed with me and has given me hope.  She said that there is a \'good guy\' up there who is watching.  Good will win out. On that Tuesday I needed to speak to my friends in the US.  Friends in Minneapolis.  Friends in Santa Barbara.  Nowhere near the East Coast.  I still needed to hear their voices, to tell them I knew.   I don\'t want war.  I know terrorism, whatever it\'s face, achieves only pain, suffering, loss of life.  I feel jaded and cynical about international politics, the hypocracy of every country\'s domestic and international policies.  I feel small, tiny, insignificant.  I want to see people as just that, wherever they come from, whatever their cultural, ethnic or economic background.  I think September 11 has left me feeling defeated, by governments, factions, racists, scape-goaters.  By people. I want the \'good guy\' to be watching.\"\"A pure, all-encompassing belief, faith, that they are right, and what they believe is right\"To punish the USA for past sins committed against Muslim fundamentalists.  Also to disrupt the economic and political systems.\"Today, I woke up feeling less sad than on previous days, but as the day has worn on,  I find myself distracted, listless and unable to concentrate.  I am a Ph.D candidate writing my dissertation in art history, and I feel that it is a very trivial field right now.  Art, however is not and knowing that helps me cope. I am afraid that the USA will be thrust into a war with an unknown enemy in hostile lands - much like Vietnam.  All the stupid technological warfare that has been debated over the last few decades will be useless for this type of conflict.  I want to be able to put my faith and trust in our leaders,  but our president doesn\'t seem to me to be much of a leader.  His advisors are and that might be our saving grace.  I was suspicious of him and his cronies during the election, and that hasn\'t left me.   I would like to spend more time thinking and reflecting.  This being the  Jewish New year is a good time to do that, but unfortunately, the kids  have to be shuttled to school and to their activities, and I have to teach my class in a little while.  Life has to go on whether I\'m ready or not. I was glued to the TV for a few days, but was relieved when normal programming came back on.  I think the media coverage has been great. I find myself most compelled to watch the rescue efforts and the human stories rather than the investigative aspects.  \"\"I have rushed home to catch up on the TV coverage. My wife  and I have felt more clingy, yet at the same time I\'ve  had less patience with my children, for whom I am so afraid. \"Osama bin Laden and the Iraqi government.\"I view the events from a Biblical perspective.  In my opinion, they are simply a taste of things to come.  I agree with those who say the attack was a wake-up call from God because we have turned away from Him.  I believe we, as a nation, need to repent and follow His Word --or we will see much worse in the days and years to come.   I am not surprised by the attack.  Shocked, yes.  But, this has been coming for a long time.  Even non-believers who have been paying attention to world events should have seen this coming.   To me, the most horrifying image is NOT that of the twin towers collapsing, or even of people jumping to their deaths... disturbing as that was.  The most terrible image -- for me -- is the mental one I have of a planeload of Americans cowering in fear because of a half dozen men armed with box cutters.  What does that say about us?  What does that say about us that our foes could plan such an attack depending on that response from us? I believe the message people should take from the example of the heroes on Flight 93 is that we are each responsible for our own security.  We have the most powerful army on the Earth...the most sophisticated weaponry...yet, a few unarmed mean saved more lives and prevented more destruction on 9-11 than all of our military, law-enforcement, and security personnel combined.  Mindset won the day.  However, the government has done its best over the years to take that mindset away from us and help ensure we are helpless against our enemies, whether terrorists or criminals.  How different 9-11-2001 would have been had each airplane had just one lawfully armed civilian aboard. I believe the government\'s response following the attack has demonstrated that, in spite of all the words about this being a war against all Americans -- where each citizen is a combatant, they still don\'t want or trust the citizenry to take care of itself.  Why declare I\'m a combatant and take away my means of fighting in the next breath?  In my opinion, an armed and trained citizenry is the best deterrence against further terrorist attacks here. \"Because they are evil.Islam\"I\'ve been working out more, gathering more information on chemical / biological warfare, and practicing tactical skills such as shooting, etc. much more.\"Each person who made the decision to follow the instructions of whoever orchestrated these events.

'Osama bin Laden terrorist organization\"I have, at least for now, changed my priorities.  I wanted to go home and hug my wife and child and protect them.  I have a deeper appreciation of the  important things  in life.  Brought back to the realization of my dependence upon God.  My prayer life has changed.\"\"Honestly, I believe that this is a wake up call from God.  We have heard over and over again that this is a war between good and evil which I believe the majority do not realize just how true this is.  The hijackers have been referred to as religious fanatics and their belief was that they were obeying God.  In my opinion, based on my beliefs, they were blinded from the truth.  This nation was founded on Biblical principles and the founding fathers were believers of the God of the Old and New Testaments.  Throughout the years, this nation has turned away from these Biblical principles leading a life of their own moral choosing, contradicting the morals established by the Bible.  God\'s word is to be  a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path  (Psalms 119:105) and this has not been the case for the majority in this country.  God is a good God but He is also a just and jealous God.  God is sovereign and in control as well, meaning He would have to allow this to happen if it were to happen.  Others may say how can you say God is good if He allows this to happen?  My response is He is good but He is not safe.  He  chastens  those He loves so that believers may walk in His ways.  Whenever a child of God strays from His path then He  leaves the 99 and goes after the one who went astray .  The response to the attack has been people praying and churches were full, many in fear but others getting the message that maybe this nation hasn\'t been following after God and obeying His word.  Another thing that does have to be pointed out is that the two targets were the world trade center (money) and the Pentagon (security).  Perhaps these have become the idols replacing the worship of God.  We shouldn\'t get caught up in all the bad without seeing some of the good from this.  Signs that God is still in control and that this could have been worse.  It is amazing that nearly 50,000 people work in the WTCs but yet only about 5,000 are expected missing (granted is terrible for the 5,000 but it could have been 50,000).  We hear a story of a police officer falling 80 stories in the avalanche of steel, concrete,etc and only suffering two broken legs.  Planes that normally seat about 300 were only half or less full.  We hear the heroics of the flight that crashed in PA of the passengers overtaking the hijackers.  This event has made me depend on my faith in God through His son Jesus Christ to help me cope with this tragedy.  His word has been a comfort as well as praying to Him and to know He is a giver of peace.  The answer I believe to this is found in 2 Chronicles 7:14, If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\"\"Blinded by Satan!

When I saw the first plan hit, I thought it was an accident, but when I saw the second plan hit I knew it was a planned attack. It took me a day to recove from the shock, as if it were that did not happen. When it sunk in that it did happen, it brought out memories from WWII when we were bombed suddenly and unexpectedly in Florence (Italy) when two bombs feel in front and in the back of our house (500 Florentines died). On another occasion, when I was in the hills overlooking Florence I saw the American bombers drop bombs over Florence again. Now I was filled with sadness and cried about the people who got killed. I immersed myself in work and I could not bring myself to look at the awful pictures of the attack. I still do not want to see them.

Modern technology enables terrorists and dictatorial governmental leaders like no time in prior history.  Hitler and Nazi Germany capitalized on mind-control, radio communications and sophisitcated weaponry to wreak havoc.  Now individuals (McVey/Oklahoma) and small groups (bin Laden,  et al) can cause tremendous trouble for the civilized world. 2.  Wars are won on the offensive.  Terrorists will win as long as they are more offensive in their actions than the civilized world is in  addressing the issues that spawn terrorist acts, including terrorist activities per se and the conditions that enable them to recruit, train, pay, supply and command terrorists. 3.  We are wise to recuit Muslims in Afganistan itself to lead the fight against terrorists holed out there because the country, like south pacific islands in WWII is a warren of defensive caves and crevices that are a night- mare to fight in.  We should elicit support from the civilized world in general and civilized Muslims in the middle east in particular to lead the effort to ferret out, prosecute and shut down terrorists there and  any governments that openly support or shelter them. 4.  In the long run, the United States would be wise to lead the civil ized world in the science and politics of defining, building and  maintaining sustainable communities.  As long as peoples are left to  their own natural self-interests, they will overpopulate, over harvest and over-use their resources and countries and create poverty, unrest, pollution, resentment and other conditions that spawn extremist beliefs, war and terrorism.  The United States has the intellectual, scientific and economic resources to quickly and effectively develop a Department of Sustainable Communities and International Dialogue and Service to  coordinate this mission.  A Department of Home Security (or whatever the new department is called) is a primitive self-protective response to the symptoms of this much deeper threat to civilization, overpopula tion and over-use of the planet. 5.  I have a host of specific ideas about exploring the science of sustainable communities, especially the psychology of sustainable communities and would love to team up with others who would like to  find funding to build an institute to this end.

But I\'d like the guilt to be decided by a world court.\"The reasons/motives are probably very many.  I have built a test that measures violence-proneness which reveals that many, many factors underlie such behavior, including feelings of academic or career failure, feelings of social rejection, rigid thinking, lack of guilt, unresolved anger, hostile pleasure, unwillingness to help reduce violence, unwillingness to seek personal counseling, access to and skill in using weapons.  Many other factors also are related, such as low trust of adults, willingness to commit crimes, feelings of general ineptness in handling unpleasant emotions, etc., etc. I expect that in terrorism adherence to fundamentalist religious beliefs, poverty or deep concern for poor  people, feelings of hopelessness, low emotional attach ment to other people, feeling unloved personally, etc. will also underlie terrorist leanings.\"\"I\'ve shared with a few collegues my interest in sus- tainable communities and that I and our government should more actively pursue them and lead the world in this effort.

I felt sick that this happened - how could anyone do such a thing.   I do not believe that the US and the US Government are completly innocent (look at the Hostages in the 1980s in Beirut, and the Iran missile exchanges etc with Oliver North), but it is terrible that so many innocent people were killed.  Why couldn\'t the damage be limited to military targets? Why couldn\'t the people on board the planes be disembarked before the planes were used as missiles?  It was shocking. BUT - i do not thing that we should go to war over it.  I fear that the world will once again witness the use of nuclear weapons.  But this time, instead of politics, war will be based on religion.  Funny - everyone dying for the same God. If Bin Laden is guilty, I doubt that religion is to blame.

I was at work so it was difficult for me to get to a TV or radio, and the news sites were disappearing from the web because of overloading. Once the scale of events was clear, my initial reaction was one of shock and horror. This was followed by fear that more attacks were in progress that we didn\'t know about. I am of the generation that was just old enough to register the seriousness of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and a worry that the violence I was watching in real time would get out of everyone\'s control and lead to monumental blunders on a global scale. (This feeling has not diminished by the way). In the days after the attack the distress and shock gave way to a feeling of depression and dejection, out of sympathy for those caught up in the tragedy. In retrospect Events have left me bewildered and insecure. Bewildered by the lack of preparedness of the intelligence community. This type of attack from rogue elements was overlooked in favour of more technically advanced threats - bio-warfare, suitcase nukes, ballistic missile launches and so on. The simplicity of the approach taken on the 11th that means the type of offensive we were all dreading (and working to avert) in the coming decade is already falling upon us now. Insecure because all Western nations are in the front line of an invisble, undeclared war. Also insecure because the identified enemy is irrational, fanatical and does not respect human life, even their own.   \"I am more tolerant of others in my everyday dealings.

I just keep hoping that something good will come out of all this.   \"nothinghatedont know0Someone would do this for attention.My behaviors have not consciously changed.No single person or group is responsible.\"Simple: It happened, lets move on.\"SameNone. Time is a remedy for the pain. The question is: do people will have the time to forget before another attack ?\"A lot of anger against the terrorists. Also, against the US gov. I mean, in France, we\'ve stayed all the afternoon, looking the TV. It was really inbelievable to see these symbols of the human greed and pride crushing in a cloud of dust; a kind of bad movie... too much realistic, frightening. Few minutes before, i was listening the radio, speaking the attentat against the WTC; but my first thought was that they were talking about the first one !  After, when we have been informed of the mechanic of the terrorist act, we\'ve think that:  - The US gouvernement has supported the muslims (Afghans and others) fanatics, providing them money, tactical advices and weapons to fight against the dying USSR. It was a real blindness because US has never mesured the danger of the muslim religion... much more dangerous than communism (don\'t even try to say that you are a christian or to show a cross in the Emirats). - Nothing has been done to stopped the well known terrorists groups, allowing some of their members to live and to get a pilot training on the US territory. - The biggest insult is that they have used US training to pilot one US plane to threaten with a US cutter (probably) to force the US plane to crash on US buildings...  The words are useless. The TV shows, little candles and flowers are irrelevant facing this declaration of war. Just emotion and compassion quickly moving to anger. Fanatics live to make the will of God... even if  God does not agree... I guess that mankind of the XXIth century must to forget the walfare of the modern comfort. The times are changing. Welcome in the era of the new crusades... a place where the life worth nothing... bilgetzAThotmail.com\"\"Blindness of all these men of power, who are looking for more power.\"I am more patient.  I spend my time grieving.  I talk to my children more and do anything I can for them.  I question what is my purpose for the remainder of my life.\"I am deeply troubled that human beings could intentionally kill so many.  I have difficulty pondering how a group of men could so soley focus on harming others.  The pain of this group or the twisted logic is beyond my comprehension.  I was sitting at my desk in WTC1 when the plane hit.  I will not stop grieving for all of the human losses and complications created by this destruction.  I am sad. I  wrote this on Sunday, 9/16. Yesterday was tough.  I wanted to return to NYC to see the Wall of Prayer and the memorials.  I had a want to get out from under the TV onslaught and to see the humanity for myself.  For those of you who don\'t know the details, I live in Queens and worked in an office on the 23d floor southwest in the World Trade Center Building One.  Yes, I was there on Tuesday, ironically reading about a Terrorist turned Teacher just arrested in Mt. Vernon, NY for an airplane hijacking from Canada to Cuba back in the early 70\'s.  The article was in the Tuesday, NY Times and I was reading it at the moment that the Building was hit.  The first word that popped in my head was terrorist.  But, I didn\'t know what that meant and I didn\'t imagine how that was being applied. The fear was horrible, the screams and expressions on co-workers faces was terrifying.  Suddenly everything taken for granted was shaking.  Though I have a great view of the Hudson River, I chose not to go to my window. Somehow I didn\'t take the steps to the outer part of my office space. Instead, I looked caddie corner through the glass of another office.  I saw debris falling.  I saw the roof of a smaller building a few blocks south of the trade center on fire.  I didn\'t understand how my building could shake and a building in that distance could be on fire.  My attention turned to the screaming co-workers.  I put on facilitator hat and sought calm.  Let\'s get on the ground resonated from my head like the teachers taught us in 1950\'s elementary schools. I called a security number and they thought possibly it was an earthquake. Direction on how to proceed wasn\'t forthcoming yet.  And then our floor fire marshall said they want us to go down the stairs.  We descended to the stairs, and the first stairway was full of people and stagnant.  A woman who was around us, said  let\'s go to another emergency exit.   We went.  A woman stepped out of the stairwell.  I tried to stop her.  She said that she couldn\'t breathe with all the people.  She had to get out.  I don\'t know what became of her.  We moved down the flights of stairs actually with a certain calm.  Some had messages that we had been hit by a plane, and then it was 2 planes.  I listened but didn\'t dwell.  We were stopped at times in the stairwell, waiting to move again. We worked well together making our way down to what\'s now known as Ground Zero.  A few people\'s health showed to be suffering in the slightly smoky stairwell.  Someone provided paper towels and others shared their water to wet the cloths so that we could breathe through the walk down.  We encouraged those showing visible signs of suffering to make their way down the stairs faster.  2 or 3 people with escorts came down from higher floors being announced as burn victims.  We just made space so they could pass.  We were respectful.  Also, very aware that they were able to walk but walking in pain and with singed skin.  No one spoke of what horrors might be above us. Firemen started coming up the stairs.  We were asked to move to the right to let them pass.  Like any chain gang we sent the messages up or down as needed.  Hauling heavy gear, wearing their protective but weighty clothes, they passed us one by one.  Trying to be positive they told us we were close and that we would make it out.  They said the air would get better.  Around the 10th or 11th floor, a fireman said to his leader,  we need to stop and rest,  we are going to need our strength.   His leader said  yeah, to fight the fire.   My co-worker, in the stairwell below me looked at me when the  fire word was mentioned.  It penetrated our silence about the conditions.  Still we didn\'t speak of this.  We continued going down, as the firemen went up...  Three firefighters in civilian clothes followed the uniformed firefighters.  One of the civilian dressed said,  let me carry some of your gear, you\'ve got a lot to carry.   And with a deep understanding smile, he won over some of the uniformed officer\'s load.  It was symbolic of a fraternity\'s commitment to one another and the higher purpose of serving others.  Probably 30 to 40 firefighters passed us on the steps. The last seven or eight floors were filled with water.  If ever their was a time to not  wear high heels - this was it.  Too late for some.  Others took off their shoes or sandals and walked bare foot.  The rest of us got wet. We made it down.  The West St. side of the building was unrecognizable.  The lobby was a shambles.  Water poured all over us.  Security personnel stood every 30 yards and kept herding us out -  faster, faster, and then we were out of the building.  FRESH AIR.  We left by the Borders Bookstore exit, and we moved towards Broadway.  Someone in my group said look back, and at that moment I saw fires burning and encircling each of the towers.  Joe, who made it out of the building with us said, the people up there are never going to make it out.   Grimness became real.  Reporters were already on the scene.  A woman reporter descended on a woman crying and leaning against the grate of a church cemetery west of Broadway. I didn\'t want to be fodder for the reporter\'s cannon. We moved towards City Hall Park, joining others looking for their co-workers.  Police were everywhere.  Emergency vehicles were descending from all directions.  A woman asked where I worked.  She watched the first plane hit. She was in a cab on the East Side Drive en route to work on the 104th floor of Building Two.   By the time they had turned on to West St. - the second building had been hit.  She worked for Cantor Fitzgerald.  We both looked up at the burning buildings and the pace and expanse of what was on fire had increased substantially from the time I first looked 5 to 10 minutes before. I kept to myself, Joe\'s message that it wasn\'t going to be promising for her peers.  We separated and I found some lawyers from my company.  We talked. One said, that he remembered that when our company, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, considered moving to the World Trade Center, an executive said that she was afraid of height and that she would only go - if we moved to lower floors.  If this is true, I owe her a kiss and a hug because this might have been the difference for myself and many of my peers. While standing with the lawyers, suddenly the ground shook.  I looked up and disbelief was transformed - I thought all of these buildings could fall down.  The building must have been falling.  I was afraid the ground could become a crater with all of us in it.  I looked down lower Broadway and saw a humongous black cloud of smoke moving north on Broadway.  I thought it was going to take over all of us.  It looked like it was moving fast, faster then we could get away from it.  I didn\'t know if there was fire behind it.  I, and everyone around me, started running for our lives.  People were screaming, falling, losing shoes and just attempting to get away.  I ran for blocks.  I had thought about throwing down my bag and wondered if that would add a few steps to be the difference in my get away.  I held on.  I slowed when I saw a woman moving her belongings in an oversized portable suitcase. She tugged her load.  I looked back.  I could walk.  I stepped slowly.  I kept looking back.  I wanted to know where the black cloud was.  New Yorkers met the devil.  Our faces told many stories.  We crowded around trucks with radios sharing the details of what was known.  I learned that the Pentagon had been hit as well.  We all walked for miles. People started reaching out to others.  Cell phones didn\'t work.  Long lines stood by pay phones.  At about `11 am, I called my wife and ended her hysteria.  I met a co-worker originally from Croatia, who said that by 10 am, his wife had received phone calls from Croatian friends and relatives to find out if he was still alive.  I saw this really muscular guy walking down the street crying.  I stopped at the first bar I could find and had some scotch.  I needed to let go of some of my defenses.  Tears started to shake out of me, as I watched a TV replay the tale.  I wanted to give blood.  I walked over to a hospital.  A few hundred stood outside the hospital waiting to give blood.  I discovered that if you had been drinking that you couldn\'t give blood.  I continued walking. I walked to 34th st and third avenue.  I saw a sign that said, police rides to Queens at 36th st and 2nd ave.  At about 1:30pm, I got a ride in an SUV through the Mid-Town tunnel to a bus that I could take to my house.  Once inside I cried and cried.  At about 3:20 pm, the phone rang.  Michelle asked if I could pick her up down the street at Mark\'s house.  My independent 10 year-old, said  Daddy, I don\'t want to walk down the street alone.   Innocence lost. The first two days after the building\'s had fallen, I cried  mostly for the firemen that went up in the inferno and gave their lives for the me\'s of the world.  I will never forget their bravery, sacrifice and commitment to their profession. Folks have been tremendously kind and supportive. And I say thanks.  This leads me back to how I started this message.  On Saturday afternoon, I grew very anxious as I got ready to leave for NYC.  I needed to get out of my house.  I couldn\'t wait for anyone.  I couldn\'t get behind the wheel to drive.  I wanted to move slowly.  I didn\'t know what to expect.  I wanted to take a train.  Reeva offered to drive.  We made it to the city pretty easily.  Parked on 28th st and 3d ave.  We walked over to Bellview Hospital and the Wall of Prayer.  We were entering a new zone.  Photos, words, and hope greet prayers.  I was drawn to view and read them all.  I came upon a woman\'s picture from my company.  Oh no, Vivian hadn\'t been found.  I sobbed and sobbed.  I just stayed with her picture.  Two grief counselors walked over to me.  I tried to understand why she didn\'t make it.  I saw on the notice that she had 3 children.  That weighed heavily on me.  The grief counselors delivering their street service to me were helpful.  I acknowledged my pain. I offered my hope.  And I moved on to sense more of how our family of New Yorkers, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Muslim, Jew, Christian, Catholic had been affected.  It is special to see a healing community spontaneously emerge to meet the needs of people feeling so much pain.  The street and entrance to the hospital were no longer the cold, boring entrance way to despair. Candles dripping, flowers, bouquets, water and charms adjoined the pictures, descriptions and phone numbers.  People offered to be of service to each other in whatever ways were needed.  New Yorkers were responding to anyone who needed assistance.  I have even stopped saying negative things about Rudi Guillianni.  I think that he has been an outstanding leader in this time of crisis.  I think he has risen to the occasion.  His pettiness has left his communications.  Family members were doing something about their situations. Bravo! I came upon 2 other Empire people that I didn\'t know who were also missing..       More pain. Right before we left the wall of Prayer , I came upon the picture of the fellow employee from Empire, who chose to remain with the quadriplegic employee.  Once, I had learned that their were people missing from Empire, my mind scanned those that I could recall.  I realized that the man who lived in a wheel chair, who breathed through tubes and did his keyboard work through some facial apparatus - would have no way to escape if he had arrived at work on time or early.  He always had an aide with him.  I wondered what happened to the aid and what thoughts was she now living with.  And how could this other physically healthy person in his fifties make such a humane and I project sacrifice?  I tried to talk to my wife about this, but it was more then she could listen to.  I knew that I wanted the grief counselors and within seconds, they showed up.  I brought them to the picture and asked if I could talk about this fellow\'s heroic action.  They listened and offered condolence and the concept of mercy.  I grew stronger by seeing the face of this man from Empire who put his friendship above his life.  I didn\'t know either of these men but I had a deep curiosity about their strength and convictions.  How many of us could do what the friend had done? We walked past the Armory where the family\'s searching were waiting.  We continued to Union Square Park.  People all along the way offered food, drink and nourishment. The memorial at Union Square was a throwback to the late sixties. Love and creativity exuded.  Tibetans drummed, art and poetry lifted spirits.  A version of London\'s Hyde Park shone through as debaters crowded to share points of view.  New life is emerging in NYC.  Out of the ashes, friendship and acceptance seem to be showing through. I\'m still crying at times.  I have worries.  I want to control things that I ordinarily don\'t think about but I\'m also better.  Stronger.   I want to go back to work.   I want to continue to serve others and share the inspirational stories that highlight these hard times.  I know that the world faces a difficult future but I am heartened by the signs in our streets of people shedding their boundaries to reach out and help someone.  This miserable destruction has given birth to a tapestry of friendship in this great city. My 3 children (almost 11, 14 and 19) have all grown in different ways from the tragedy.  They represent a diversity of political views, and share a new sensitivity and maturity about helping others. What ever you can do to help others is appreciated.  Find that spark of inspiration in you and touch others. Love,  Scott Gassman \"\"Based on Political and Media accounts, Osama Bin Laden, the Egyptian murderer of Sadat and Sadam Hussein.\"They thought that it was right.  They were serving their holy purpose.  And retribution for all that America/capitalism have done in the world.not much at allOsama bin Laden and his terrorist network.  But also capitalism in an indirect way.  Our disregard for human rights seems to have come back to haunt us.\"The scale of the attacks is overwhelming.  In spite of seeing the TV pictures, I can\'t seem to get my mind around the enormity of what was down.  I hesitate to say this, but in a strange way, I almost admire what the hijackers achieved.  If it weren\'t for the horrendous loss of life, I could almost feel the thrill that I imagine the plotters must have felt when they actually caused the towers to fall.  I disagree with Bush, these weren\'t cowards.  They were clearly brave even if fanatical and crazy.  A coward wouldn\'t kill himself to achieve this goal.  The whole thing feels surreal to me.  It reminds me of Apocalypse Now -- if you can believe it, I saw the  redux  version of the movie the night before the attacks.  In Apocalypse Now there\'s a similar sense of vicarious thrill to the power of destruction during the helicopter attack with Wagner playing.  That is, until we see the human destruction as people are cut down, including women and children.  I also worry about some American who seem ready to attack and persecute all arabs and all muslims.  I hope we don\'t just perpetuate the violence by indiscriminately attacking civilians in Afghanistan.  \"Anger with the US\'s policies.No change except for a feeling of greif for the Americans who lost their lives and their familes.Depraved Retaliation.\"  Chickens Coming Home To Roost   One more thought:  Clear Large Lots - In Both Camps, Because Burial Grounds will be in demand.\"Zealots.I just feel bad about what happened.Cause they hate Americans and its true we should let others kill each other but regulate to a point.Those damm towel heads need to pay for this shit!!!!The USA for even thinking and training Bin Laden and now that we are against him hes using the weapons on us which we gave to him to fight against The former Soviet Union.',4,-5,0,2,5,0.53,2.13,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,0,0.53,0.53,0,9.03,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,1.6,0.53,0.53,0,0,0,0,3.19,2.66,0,1.06,5.58,0,0,0,4.53,0,0,0,2.39,0,0.53,0.27,0,28.17,0,2.66,0,0,0,0.53,0,0,39.33,4.25,0,6.11,0,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.97,11.16,0,0,0,0,1.59,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,1.33,0.53,0,0,1.33,Male

I couldn\'t really believe that this was happening.  On top of that, I live in Chicago, so I was somewhat frightened of an attack here (though in my mind I knew there would be no government targets here).  Most of the day was shock and occasional blasts of realization and pain.  I managed to get a hold of everyone that I know in Manhattan, so I was somewhat relieved, although the magnitude of the tragedy was not lessened.   Now I am scared, but not of more terrorist attacks (at least not immediately).  I am afraid of the reaction of our country.  People go between expressing disbelief that anyone could do this to expressing the desire to return the favor on Afghanistan, which is basically hypocritical.  I fear for Arab-Americans and their civil liberties.  I feel, to no small extent, that the face of racism in this country is being disguised as patriotism.  I am not filled with hate and anger, as people around me are, but rather I am filled with sorrow, shock (still), fear, and frustration.  In my opinion, the people responsible for these attacks must be found and tried, but I do not believe that people capable of this type of action are found only in Islam or only outside the United States.  I think about the two atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of the second world war.  Americans cheered that and the death toll was much higher.  People claim that that was during a war, but the bombs were not dropped on military targets, they were dropped on civilians.  I believe that people, as a nation, tend to forget or rationalize their horrific actions while never letting go of those perpetrated upon them.  And with those mentalities, fueled by ignorance and malice, we have no hope of peace or justice.  I am frightened and trying to find hope within people that I know.  I am sure there is more for me to say, but I can\'t think of it now.  \"\"  When I first was the attack on The World Trade Center on CNN, before I realized the scope of the damage, I thought it was just a re-broadcast of the 1993 bombing.       I think that was the brain telling me subconsciously that it was and unreal event. I simply could not conceive of an act so horrible, and such a broad spectrum of damage.     For the first week I still simply  refused to accept  the damage,carnage, and death. How could the World Trade Centers, a symbol of America\'s strength, financial prosperity and freedom be  gone.  And what of about 6500 fellow country men and women?    After all I am an American, and I had been to the Twin Towers visitor center twice in 1993. Not that the Pentagon deaths didnt strike home for me too. After all I am in the US Army and that is MY supreme headquarters. I have also been there twice.\"The literal belief that they would somehow be rewarded by a supreme being (God) for killing thousands of  innocent peopleTerrorists from the Middle East\"   More partriotic, closer identity with all citizens of the country\"noneTotal helplessness.

All you have to do is accept the free gift of grace and you will be saved from eternal seperation from God.hard heart -deceived about purpose\"I think that what happened on September 11 was truly devastating.  It is unfortunate  that people feel they are going to please their god by killing Americans.  It is a  shame that so many people had to lose their lives but I think a lot of good has come  out of it and I think that God was glorified through the event. As I was processing the whole thing I couldn\'t help but think about what made the  attackers hijack the planes.  I was reminded of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus in the  Bible.  It says that God hardened Pharaoh\'s heart.  What happened?  Israel was delivered out of slavery and worshipped Yahweh (God).  God wants us to worship Him.  It is what brings him the most glory.  As a result of the attacks on America, many people have  put their faith in Jesus Christ and in all reality become worshipers of God.  I think that everything happens for a reason and it isn\'t always an earthly reason.  God was bringing glory to Himself.  Unfortunately it took something like this to get people to turn to  Him. \"Not much\"A group of ultra-radical anti-american people - while the US cannot get away from its role in this, the final responsibility is with the group itself\"\"I first heard about the events when my roommate, who was watching it all on TV back at the apt., called me at school.  The first thing I did after he talked to me was go to the dept. computer lab and try to look for more information.  All of the US news sites were overloaded, so I went to the Globe and Mail\'s (Canada) and the BBC\'s (UK) websites - then those became cumbersome.  Just as I walked back into the office, my roommate called again about the Pentagon and I was still not as much shocked as I was intrigued by it all.  Eventually, a TV was set up in one of the classrooms that wasn\'t being used, so we watched the events there.  I remember I just felt a very cold feeling all over when I saw the Towers collapse.  I had heard about the event and read about it on the net, but it was seeing the actual collapse on TV that really freaked me out.  I think from the time I saw the towers collapse and when I went to lunch was a little over an hour, but it felt like a day.  My friend and I went to lunch and just talked about how this was going to get ugly.  In fact, my whole day was consumed with thoughts of how the govt. would react to this - I was scared.  The clips of President Bush did not do anything to ease my mind.  In fact, his wooden dememanor and scripted speech just made me mad.  I\'m not saying I want to see him pound his fist and swear, but it just seemed like pandering to me.  The rest of the day was just me zoning out until I decided to call it a day at 3:00pm.  When I got back, I turned on the TV and watched for 5 straight hours - something I have never done.  It felt to me that the networks were just spinning their wheels waiting for the next super-newsworthy event to come on - that made me mad as well.  I remember when the networks did the first broadcasts of footage of the crash and collapse from people using videocameras.  One in particular was filled with swearing (i.e.,  holy fucking shit ,  jesus fucking christ ) and the anchor kept apologizing for the profanity and mentioned how, given the circumstances, decorum is not a priority.  The way I saw it - as I said to my roommate - if anything described the WTC collapse (and September 11 as a whole) in three words, it was holy fucking shit.  Overall, I\'m in this weird limbo - I understand it but I don\'t condone it.  The rampant jingoism and fairweather (poorweather?) patriotism makes me sick and helps me understand the whys of the event.  Now that we\'ve decided to bomb Afghanistan, my opinion is shifting even further away from the rah-rah majority - what did the average Afghani citizen do to deserve that?  I guess, to wrap up, it comes down to what I told my friend at lunch: this is far from over, and that\'s the worst part of all.\"\"To make a difference, to get a reaction, to  wake up  Americans\"Desparation.They really haven\'t.\"I\'m feeling strangely detached from all of this. My reaction seems to be something of a  life goes on  acceptance of the WTC tragedy, coupled with a sense that the United States has finally had to deal with something that millions of people have to deal with worldwide. Theree is a sense of destiny in this, I think, and I\'m not at all sure that I have any feelings about it beyond the sense of acceptance I mentioned before.\"\"I think we\'ll find that Osama bin Laden had a hand in it, but that ultimately, responsibility will for the WTC attack lies in a web of organizations and countries (including Sadam Hussein).  I _hope_ that the U.S. will also realize that the U.S.\'s previous foriegn policies have contributed to terrorism--both by failing to deal with the issues that gave rise to it, AND by failing to acknowledge it as a real threat.  (I in no way, however, believe the U.S.  deserved  what it got.)\"???AwfulI pray more.Hatred engendered by past events which left one feeling they had no other choice.Middle East foreign policy of the US the last 50 years\"IU am torn between the grief cause the deaths on September 11. I am concerned that past US foreign policy has resulted in such intense hatred from the governement and people of the United States. I am concerned that our government and most of the media is not looking at our inventory for causing such hatred. I am concerned that anything less than violent retailiation - war - is not acceptable to the present US government and a majority of the American Adults.  I am concerned that our economy/employment will go to a war base economy/employment - with billons being spent on war, war industry, military payrolls, military equipment and military research - at the expense of the American people.\"\"I have gotten less work done and felt closer to strangers that I see in grocery stores, or in random places.  I have been careful to be polite and kind with everyone.\"Islamic Extremists\"I feel personally touched by this event as no other atrocity that I has occurred in my lifetime has touched me.  I feel pain in my heart in every reflective moment and that occurs numerous time every day.   I have been surprised at this feeling inside of me.  In the last decade, I have been very aware of circumstances in which civilian populations have been made targets and have died in large numbers in Bosnia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Palestinian Territories and etc.  I have been outraged, angered, hurt, saddened by attacks on innocents.  But the feelings I had for the victims of Grozny or Chechnya had a degree of circumspection that I only now appreciate.  The attacks of September 11 are more immediate in my awareness and intrusive.  I am ineluctably grieved by these events.  I have been angered in the days since the attacks by the failure of leadership that I percieve in the President of the US.  In the hours and days since the attacks, the message from this person has only been a vague promise of revenge that is repeated like a mantra.  The problem of world terrorism is a complex one that has not gone away in many countries despite the dedication of numerous police and military resources.  In this case, we have no target and I fear that compelled by idiotic promises, this president will carry another generation of Americans into a ground war fought against an enemy that is illusory for ends that cannot possibly be achieved.   What I look to leaders in my community to communicate in the days after a tragedy of this proportion: permission to grieve.\"I think the perpetrators are CERTAIN that these attacks serve God.

I\'m in New York, so I can look out and see the missing WTC, but I have not yet...\"Like the media says Osama Bin Laden and his group.\"Fear of change, anger at the behavior of the US in supporting Israel. Stupidity because we will not stop. Revenge?\"none...nicer to arabsChemical imbalance...not enough attentionI think it sucks and it is discusting!!Psycho terrorists.....not neccessarily Bin Laden either\"It was a horrible event but quite expected. I am surprised Americans were so confident about their security. They burn both - Israeli and American flags so it makes sense for them to do it to both countries.  Even though power wise we are much sronger - individually they (whoever they are) are much stronger and more determined than we are. As Bin Laden said -  We want to die and you want to live . That was a very good point. Therefore, the war against them will be more difficult and longer than most people hope or expect. \"000\"     Not much, other than my mood.\"     There is no way to know.     They are sick.  It requires a mental sickness to commit an act like this.  No sane person would fly a plane into a building.  They are diseased with blind love for a leader and the blind belief in a religion.  They are what Hoffer called  The True Believer .\"Like most people who  witnessed  this tragedy I\'m feeling a mixture of emotions.  I find it disturbing and frightnening that something like this could happen on American soil.  I think someone in the American intelligence community made an enormous error.  I\'m angry with the people who committed this act.  I think there is a sickness required in order to do something like this.  Above all I feel sadness for the victims.  Every other feeling I have seems trivial when I think about what they must have gone through.  In the list of victims there was a  two year old girl and a four year old girl.  I can\'t imagine what it would require of a person to be on a plane with a child and do what these terrorists did.  That is the question that I have not heard one person ask though.  What does it take to push a person to commit this act?  When someone commits an act of violence we tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  It usually involves feelings of hatred and a desire for an equally terrible response (unfortunately that was my initial reaction).  We don\'t look at the person who commits the act and say,  it must be terrible to feel that way .  In order to deal with an act like this we say  an eye for an eye .  This won\'t solve any problems.  It will only create new ones.      The problem is that with my feelings of pity for the people who killed so many, comes a feeling of guilt.  How can we ever rationalize any positive feelings towards these people when their actions caused so many to suffer?  How can we morally deal with these people without disrespecting the memory of the dead?  That is my conflict and the reason for my confusion since September 11.  When I argue against vengence, those who argue for it reframe what I am saying.  They will say that I\'m  protecting the criminal .  It\'s hard to be sure that I\'m not.  I\'m a very empathic person.  And as I said, every other feeling I have seems trivial when compared to what the victims went through.  Thus, my attempts to come to a rational solution are burdened by my emotions and empathy for the victims.        Right now my feelings about what happened are just beginning to give way to anxiety about what\'s to come.  I do not have faith that the leaders of this nation and those of our allies are prepared to handle this situation.  The United States has performed so poorly in the Middle East.  I don\'t see us turning things around any time soon.  We are living in a very confusing point in human history.  The anxiety of the times is making very hard for people to act rationally.  Hopefully cooler heads will prevail.  After recent events, it is hard to feel optimistic.\"To make a statement and feel accomplishment in a situation in which nothing more could be taken.\"All arabs who oppose the US and partially, American polotics.  Specifically, the teliban and Ossama bin laden\"\"I believe this is an oppurtunity for the United States to show the world exactly how smart we can be in terms of the retalitory effort.  I fear the possibility of over-reaction as well as the possibility of being to political.  I think politics is very much the reason why we are in this mess.  I feel that military efforts to secure the United States is appropriate until this is resolved.  (ex. military posts in airports etc.)  Very well thought out plans should not be foiled by a weaker foe, even though that foe\'s homeland could potentially even the playing field.  I certainly hope the military is training appropriately.  As for those who died, it is trajic, but we all face death on a daily basis; Americans just don\'t think they do.\"I think a little more about life in general.  I also feel more justified in my prejiduces.What a stupid inflammitory question! The terrorists on the planes who are now dead. Organisors of the attacks. All those who terrorise the middle east. World debt and poverty.Unable to work or concentrate. Increased television viewing.Because they feel angry and powerless and determined to change the world.\"I first heard about a plane crashing into the WTC from my girlfriend, who rang me. She sounded a little shaky, so I felt that some catastrophe had occurred. Immediately I turned on the TV and stunned at the pictures. I could not work or do anything except watch the news reports. I flicked between channels. I felt immobilised, but curious as to how a thing like this could happen...wanting more facts. Imagining what it was like for a plane to enter such a structure. Then it became like a game, as it became known that an aircraft had crashed into the pentagon. Then a report of another in the air...Would the US shoot it down?  Initial reports here in the UK said that only 6 people had been killed (apart from the plane), so I felt very little sadness. Then the buldings collapsed, and I felt a real dread that something awful was going to happen. I feared that my shares would be affected, and started to get angry that I hadn\'t withdrawn my money from the stock market. Several counterfactuals started to play out in my mind. My girlfriend and I were calling each other every now and then to say  Did you you here about... . We were assimilating facts to make sense of it all. But I must have seen the second plane crash about 150 times, and became saturated with the story. At one level I became addicted (coming from a TV news background)to the story and the images. At another I felt I had experienced enough of the story and wanted to hear other things. But I could not work several days. I never really felt upset for the people that died, but I could see that others were upset, and felt that I  should  be feeling upset too. My attention was turned to the lame responses of Bush, and the media frenzy that followed. I became disgusted at the amount of right-wing attitudes that were turning up. The racism disgusted me and all the talk of revenge and retribution annoyed me and made me feel powerless to stop the insanity. It was so dissapointing to see world leaders thinking in such irresponsible warmongering ways that just provided a good reason why people resort to terrorism in the first place. Demonising the third world, and not trying to understand the causes of such actions is the wrong way of going about this. I began to feel afraid that a big war would be started for no good reason, and no good outcome will come out of this. I feel sorry for Afghanistan, and fear that there will be more misunderstanding in the world and hatred against Muslims. Where is Bush\'s Christianity? What is this talk of the  free world , of  civilized world . These tropes of freedom and civilization are disguided forms of racism. What about the terrorism inflicted by the US, by the UK? Harbouring terrorists???? What about the US supporting the IRA? What about the CIA killing people? What about all the bullying that the US does in the world? Do Americans appreciate this? Can they appreciate it? Isn\'t that also terrorism!? The hypocrasy was making me sick. I had to remind myself that what we are witnessing was a media event and not the event itself. Highly stylised and packaged to sell to a common market. But the stupidity of it all is frustrating. So I have also been mad at the biased reporting and the lack of caution and the stupid things that people say. I have been yelling at the TV. When will it end? However, I was pleased to see Bush give a press conference at a mosque ... that was hopeful. And the UK media have been including the views of pacifists and academics which has tempered the storm somewhat. Interestingly most of the focus has been on the WTC, and not on the crahes at the Pentagon or Camp David. I suspect that the TV images have fuelled the enormous emotional focus on the WTC, as that is were the dramatic pictures are. I wonder how the world would have reacted if there were no TV pictures of the actual explosion and collapse. Peace, forgiveness and understanding.\"It has made me closer to God which is our only rescue and salvation.\"I see horror through my tears-filled eyes. I despise all evil and I despise the individual who have done this. These individuals do not care about innocents lives or even life itself. They\'ve entered into the hearts of the terrorists so that you will not know who is the true enemy. The terrorists who opened these wounds, killing and maiming our brothers and sisters, parents and grandparents, struck each of us, if not in body, then in conscience. Not since Pearl Harbor has this nation been so severely injured by enemy aggression. And never again will anyone of our generation feel a sense of security at home, at work, or in our travels. \"because they are sickno sureI think that the men who did this felt great pride in their faith and heritage and saw the U.S. as a threat to that  culture. I think they were threatened enough to commit these acts.\"A great number of people. Everyone thinks it\'s bin Laden. I don\'t know if that is necessarily true, however I do think he inspired the acts of the men who committed this horrendous crime.\"\"The attack was the most tragic event that I think any of us will ever see. The fact that drives this home for me is that we lost more people during that day, in peacetime, than any other day in U.S. history, war or peace! All of the people touched by this is really hurtful to me, however, I think that a greater union, among Americans, as well as among all people who denounce the attacks, will result.\"\"As we all do, I watch the news more than before, but more importantly, I will never look at the American flag in the same way. I think my generation has taken for granted the rights and freedoms we share and, I hope, these events will eradicate that feeling. A great many people, young and old, grew up on 11 Sept. \"\"I live in Toronto, On. Canada. I am still experiencing alot of anxiety and continue to feel down. I know this is attributed to the attacks. What worries me is that I make attempt to meditated almost daily which helps releive some of the stress, however I know so many people who have attempted push the incident aside and pretend like everything is alright. This worries me because I know that the fear and sadness that remains will need to find an escape. I hope these individuals find a productive release and not let the despair lead to violence. We are at a communal loss and are experiencing shared despair. We can let this incident bring us together and strengthen our resolve against violence and create a future of peace or let it destroy all that we as civilized people have worked so hard to create and maintain. Like a knife in the terrorists pie we may begin to divide and separate indiviuals, communities, religions, cultures, and countries. Another worry,  Christian Fundamental beliefs. Like extremist fundamentalists I see christian fundamentalism in America and Canada as serving to fuel the fire of fear and terror. I worry that there will be many more Wacco\'s to come in the near future. Not only that but as people begin to look for meaning they may be open to fundamentalist beleifs that provide simple answers for a complex world. These Christian Fundamentalist - some of whom have links to the Bush Govn\'t may rise in power and status -  especially as the war machine gears up for the slaughter and attempts to turn the American economy which is on its way down, around. Although people are saying there is so much uncertainty, I beleive things are clear. America\'s oligarchy is being threatened, and they are not going to go down without a fight. American mass culture will be so misinformed that they will blindly follow whatever meassures are taken to  protect freedom . This will not happen right away but will be incremental. There will not be calls for peace on a grand scale, only calls for revenge shadowed as  justice . I appreciate this forum for discussion. I hope many people visit it so that they can work some of this stuff out and have some release before it is too late.   \"We all are. Anger has a source.

'BECAUSE THEIR COWARDSI think that the attacks on America was a act by cowards.I know that Americans will be more aware of whats going on in the world.All terrorist0I don\'t understand well. The politician and the army. \"I did not change the daily life, and went to the part-time job. While the part-time job, the event  became the main topic of conversation. \"\"Dear Sir. I received a request to answer your investigation from Masao Yogo, associate professor of department of psychology. I am a japanese student at Doshisha University and studying a mechanical  engineering.I had the opportunity to participate in his lecture.Sometimes  I write my feelings,for example, distress and pleasure at the letter  and send them to him. The act to my him is the field which you are studying. I saw this event on TV.I saw that the high building was burning. Because there is not a person in the picture,I mistook for being the  part of some movie.I knew after the event the building was the center of the trade.So,in the moment that an event was caused, I thought  that the airplane merely bumped against the tall building.Of course,  I thought this event was not an ordinary thing.I am the human being who has a conscience. But I wasn\'t surprised as much as the person who  saw that event directly. The mass communication doesn\'t tell new information and only repeats  the same picture.I had a doubt to the way of mass communication\'s  telling an event.In japan,the way of reporting the damage of the  earthquake in Kobe became a problem.I ruffled by the way of the report as if to see just like uncommon the curious spectators.The excited  announcer doesn\'t seem to be telling a situation accurately. Gradually I ruffled. Because I saw that event from a distance, it was difficult for me  to take the event as the actual one.I didn\'t feel sad as deeply as  American.We don\'t feel sad every time we see terrible news. As an event was reported in detail, I became fearful. After I knew that the terrorist caused the event, I thought the similar event may happen in Japan. Nothing will break out immediately, I think optimistically now. \"I have no clue I a little more alert about where I\'m at like football games and airport;places that can attract a lot of people.revenage\"    I was shock about how things took place and how the airplane flew directly into the towers.

What i fear is not that of harm and terror, though i am concerned, but that these actions may lead many to fear, hate, and punish those people that are not necessarily the same. Color, religion, race, etc. Judging others based on these credentials will force us back to the 1950\'s. We as a species, have moved too far in the last fifty years to let one moment in time destroy all that so many have died in the past trying to establish.

Seems like some don\'t realize that you surely can negotiate with people with a bit of respect for  human life and for opinions different to their own but regarding the Taliban or Bin Laden i don\'t believe they are open to negotiation. I think the way the Bush administration has acted is very senseful, very calm in the view of the cruel attacks and sometimes there is no other way than to attack. I hope we will win the fight against those terrorists and I am very happy that America has stated clearly that it is not fighting islam but terrorism. \"\"Well, to be honest, i can\'t think of one reason other than insanity\"\"I am thinking more about what really matters in life, i am more focused on family and friends now and on enjoying every single day.\"\"Terrorists for sure.

Yet if there is one silver lining in this, its that it may shock the US out of its introspective attitude and make it engage more with the rest of the world.  The support in NY for the IRA still has a bitter taste for some Londoners bombed over the past few years.\"None.

To this date 10,000 Indians were killed in Kashmir.  Bombay was rocked by a serial bomb blast in the 90\'s where 600 people died. All the evidence points back to Pakistan and Afganistan.

On one hand, deep anger and outrage at this massacre of innocents, compassion for the victims and their families, a special feeling for New York which I\'ve always enjoyed as a special and unique place.  Some wonderful stories of compassion amongst people who are supposed to be cynical and self-absorbed.  The heroism of firefighters and rescuers is to be admired.  I\'m haunted at times by images of those planes and those towers, and frightened at the possibillity of biochemical warfare (that your Pentagon has developed and refined over the years). On the other hand, I\'m deeply disturbed over the nationalistic orgy that this has aroused.  I do agree with the basic policy of a protracted war against this profound threat, and my country has joined in the effort.  I am satisfied to see that, for whatever reason, your President has disassociated himself from the redneck backlash against people of other ethnicities and nationalities. However,  I see very disturbing signs of unreason at a time where it is most needed. Dissent is virtually nonexistent in your mass media (look at CBC and BBC WEbsites for some perspective).  You treatment of many other countries has not been altruistic; for example, see Christopher Hitchins\' two-part series in Atlantic magazine on Kissinger as a war criminal.  It has passed notice that September 11 is also the anniversary of the 1973 coup in Chile, supported by your CIA.  I see, once again, this utter stupidity of believing that the  enemy of my enemy is my friend , forgetting how you armed Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden in other times.  Righteous anger is fine, but not self-righteousness. And, the  world  has not changed.  Such statements betray a provincialism that is the despair of your friends.  You (and we) have joined the rest of the world.  Europe, Latin America and Israel have lived for decades under the threat of terrorism.  We live in a world that is more dangerous that we were willing to believe.  I fear that you will sink into a paranoia reminiscent of McCarthyism in response.  Then America also becomes frightening.\"I\'m more reflective.  Spend more time in prayer and appreciation for what I have.I only know what is in the news.

The hurt doesn\'t go away. As a nation we are changed into believing ourselves not so invunerable.  The resolve, the reaching out to others is encouragig.  Save the prejudice of hate and anger that lashes out to someone who is put into enemy status because of skin, dress, accent or country of orgin or religious heritage.  Can we work to see what fosters the resolve for someone to become a suicide terrorists, especially when it is of the best and brightest.  Justice must be mediated but not with out regard to the future.  We are still the nation who helped rebuild Japan and Germany.

'0OSAMA BIN LADENRELIGIOUS FANATICSNONE\"just a test, will link off our home page at CSU Fresno if ok.\"000\"Because we are all so confused.  I think the terrorists are confused about religion, confused about cultures, confused about each others wants and needs.  I think they may hold us responsible for things we never knew we were responsible for.  At the same time, I think we were deeply confused, not about the danger that terrorists around the world pose, but we were deeply confused about how to respond to this sooner.  \"\"Many, many, many people and events.  Osama Bin Laden, network of terrorists all around the world, our own country\'s inability to understand the hatred of militant members of Islam, our administration\'s inability to respond without weapons... I hold everyone responsible... including myself for not understanding these things sooner.\"\"I am so deeply torn in so many different ways by these events.  First, the tragic jet crashes were so much more than I can bare.  Thinking about the waves and waves of people dying at several different moments (the initial impact killing passengers and office workers, people jumping out of windows in New York, people crashing to the ground in heaps of rubble... even the inadvertent ways people died... maybe falling down the stairs, getting into car accidents, etc.) has just crushed me over the past few days.  The word  Horror  cannot even begin to describe.  At the same time, I am so troubled by the images of destruction that are saturating our radio and air waves... I wonder how those who lost loved ones in these tragedies feel about seeing replays of the jets and continuing body counts replayed over and over again. At the same time, I agree that our nation will change... but I am so fearful of what that change will be.  What is our nation going to look like in a few months, years, decades?  What civil liberties will we have to sacrifice?  What freedoms will we have to throw away in order to secure the overall theme of democracy?  Why don\'t we talk about those potential lost liberties as a casualty of this conflict. I am struck by the media... its wizardry, precision, and grace in one moment... and its blatant stupidity the next.  One of the greatest characteristics of a free democratic society is the ability of its citizens to debate, yet there seems to be no debate about this -- we\'re going to war.  What the hell happened to the debate?  Why don\'t we, as a nation, understand exactly why these terrorists chose to sacrifice themselves?  Why aren\'t we, as a people, being told about the world\'s hatred for us and why have we never understood this fact?  Why aren\'t we doing something about this?  I fear, more and more, that our country is simply entering into its  war machine  state, and I feel, more and more, that our nation\'s media is entering lock-step with our military leaders.  Our nation\'s media has spent the last few years (in times of prosperity) questioning every subtle move that administrations have made... they\'ve questioned phraseology, words, and the subtle context clues hidden within raised eye brows and smirks.  But what now.... no one seems to be questioning the why the administration is going down this path, whether there are any other options,  why  the world is pissed off with us to begin with.  Where has our media gone?  What are they going to look like when this is over with. I am currently applying to law school, and it is so hard to think about that at a time like now.  However, the law school admissions process is the only thing that\'s keeping me sane.  The deadlines have at least given order to my life... they\'ve focused me somewhat.  I feel so fortunate just to be able to say that I want to go to law school... to have a dream... and to be alive to be able to realize that dream.  Finally, just seeing application deadline dates like  January 12, 2002  show me that there will be a tomorrow.\"\"I pause, occasionally, whenever I hear a plane fly overhead.  I wouldn\'t call it fear, just a pause.  I won\'t be flying anytime in the near future, and I don\'t know if I\'ll ever just pass a firefighter or a police officer again without mentally praising them in my mind.\"None.\"The Islamic terrorists are completely evil.   This is a wake-up call to the U.S., a second Pearl Harbor. It is time to abandon the policing paradigm of investigation and a summons to a court.  That is no longer appropriate.  I\'m not sure it ever worked against terroism anyway. It is time to recognize that a war is being inflicted upon us, and to respond following the war paradigm:  Kill the enemy until they beg for peace.  Hang their leaders.  Occupy their land and re-educate them. I do not believe that this was done by a few madmen out of a peaceful population.  These acts had a lot of financial backing, and the quiet support of governments and quasi-governmental organizations.  We\'ve seen video of people dancing in the streets when they got this news.  Those people are our enemies. Don\'t just go for one terrorist organization. We know there are several who might have been involved, and they will be in on the next mass murder if they weren\'t in on this one. Kill them all. \"A consortium of anti-Western terrorist organizations.\"The hate  Western civilization  and the U.S. as the leading figure in it.  They feel humiliated because Islam is supposed to lead the world, according to their lights, and it\'s not. They feel inadequate and second rate, and feel our mere existence is an insult to God. They feel their culture is being undermined by our movies and videos, and by envy of our way of life.  We have made many Arabs rich by buying their oil, but they feel poor in spirit.  There is nothing we can do to assuage their feelings, except to die.  If everyone in the U.S. died, they would then proceed to hate Europe, then Australia.\"\"I think that the event is a tragedy and never should have happened. Nothing can be given or said that would justify such actions. Having said this, and with understanding that the events did happen, the government\'s response is next at hand. To respond with the same force and in the same way would lower us below those who committed the same act. Not to mention the kickback from doing so. I think that justice needs to be done, but not  justice  in the way most Americans want. We need to recognize that violence breeds violence and most likely exacerbated violence. Feeding the flame and the reason to attack us again can not be the answer. Complete peace will not result from violence. We should seek out Benladin and let the judicious backbone of the country lead. He should be innocent until proven guilty and tried like any other human. Bombing innocent lives is not the answer, that\'s already been done in Afghanistan. The Muslim religious/political leaders have already stated that an attack on an Islamic country will be viewed as an attack on Islam. We shouldn\'t make things worse by being hasty and/or vengeful.\"Not much0\"Ben Ladin, not necessarily the Afghanistan government.\"\"It is no doubt the bombing is criminal and disrespect of human rights. But this event is by no means isolated and lacks precedence. We need to look at all such events that happened in the past to see how the international comunity, USA, NATO, and other superpowers reacted to them. Secondly, the US needs to change its strategies for pursuing its foreign interests. It should, forthwith, stop depending on subversive elements to achieve its goals. Such underhand approaches generate fundamentalaists and extremist tendencies. Osam bin Laden is a boomerang of US faulty policy in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Middle East and Central Asia. Thanks\"to avenge their fallen heroes and for the promise of going to heavenUSA and superpowers own faulty foreign policies\"getting to know more about international, diplomatic affair by reading. I contributed an article to a local newspaper saying that Terrorism is an Old War Ignored. It is not new as the wounded US president would have us believe. It takes a new dimemsion after the tuesday 11th September attack.\"0000\"The 11 September events are touching the safety that we feel in a world of peace and freedom. We all live with all sorts of problems. Big problems and small problems. Which are problems that can be solved and finally the State is of good will and we trust our Governments. But obviously there are people living on this world who consider our destruction as their holy goal. From our point of view this is an insame attitude, but nevertheless it exists and it threatens. This is making the quality of life lower as I thought it was.  And there is so much energy going lost for nothing and there is so much destruction going lost for nothing. In my youth I learned in religion that mankind lives in a  State of misery . This is a certain answer on it. Mankind cannot elevate above itself. Just when we are lucky we can live long and peaceful without that our lifes are touched by inhuman events.  But it is always for the time being. The incertainty of nowadays makes me remember the safety that we have lived in for so long. I do hope that terorrism indeed can be eliminated.\"Those who have attacked.Hate and brainwashing.Not really so far that I can see.\"When first hearing about the attacks I was dumfounded. I am currently a college freshman, and I was curious as to how the professors and students would react, and I was amazed at how everyone wanted to help, and the amount of people that went to our services to remember those that were killed. I respect all of the fireman and police offices that immedatiley tried to help those that were trapped in the buildings, and for all those who lost their lives trying to help others keep thiers. I also respect all of the stars of america that have made donations for the families that have suffered by these attacks, and I think that shows the unity that America has when it is needed, and it is reasurring that we can come together when we are in a time of need. Looking back on this it is an amazing time, and I continue to hope that our country stays united until we find the people who are responsible for this horrific act of violence.  \"\"Whenever I hear a airplane it makes me remember the event, and I try and feel for those that were killed in the attacks. \"\"Usama Bin Laden, and his followers.\"\"Personally feel that the United States has done something wrong, and they are punishing us.\"They haven\'t (yet).\"One man\'s freedom fighter is another man\'s terrorist.  Assuming that Osama bin Laden is indeed the  perpetrator then his zealotry (in his mind)is entirely  appropriate. Was the AMerican Revolution an act of  terrorism resulting in the overthrow of a legitimate  government or was it a bunch of people liberating  themselves from oppressive colonisers? I imagine whoever did this (have you ruled out  American Nationalists?)believed they had a legitimate  grievance against the USA. It was clearly too well planned to be a random act of violence. My personal belief is that terrorism is wrong  and should not be tolerated ever. BUT when is it terrorism, when is it freedom fighting?\"\"I heard the news on my local radio station on the morning show. The announcers patter is always intended to make you laugh. So when they first announced the attack, I thought it was a joke ad waited for a punch-line that never came. My wife and I boht leapt out of bed to turn the TV on where we saw the plane crash into the second tower. It was astonishing almost unbelievable. It seemd unreal. Once I arrived at my workplace, most of my workmates sat down and watched more coverage of what had happened. As far as I am aware I knew no-one in New York. The first few times I saw the crash and people waving from the windows I felt shocked, dismayed, upset, stunned, sadness, empathy, pain. However after a day or two, I just feel sadness and sorrow for the people who lost loved ones. Although this seems crass, my concern is for my wife and I because of the financial impact on world  markets. My mortgage will go up, things will cost more, our standard of living will drop. I live in New Zealand and am a New Zealander. When the big players on the world stage fight, its  the little guys who become the victims of  friendly fire  or are listed as collateral damage. \"I don\'t know. But it was wrong.

'\"I no longer hold back expression of my feelings of patriotism and love for my country.  I talk about this, and I display the flag in several places.  I am considering preparing for additional attacks, although they are unlikely in my area.  I never let my vehicle gas tank dip below half empty in case we\'d need to travel somewhere in a hurry.\"\"Three reasons: 1: Power: We are the worlds great superpower.  Power creates nemisis.  They hate us as the symbol of all that oppresses them.   2) Economic adversity: Their moral constituents are poor, used to terror, and very unhappy with their plight. 3) Cultural aversion: The extreme radicalism of their interpretation of Islam drives them to murderously hate our violations of its principles, including our respect for women as equals to men.\"\"This is by far the worst single thing that\'s happend to the United States since the Civil War.  Through their unspeakable hatred and the wanton killing of innocent civilians, a network of extremists has forced themselves heavily onto our agenda.  We have to do something about this.  I have felt sad at least once every day since this has happened.  And I have also felt rage.  My first feelings of rage are at some of my own countrymen, because so many of us are blinded by a sense of superiority in our society of tolerance, that we cannot see straight to defend ourselves.  For years I have been saying that we should take the terrorists declarations of war and intent to slaughter us seriously.  As a country we somehow had to allow them this terrific success before we responded with any fortitude.  And some people are still spouting the same rhetoric about a  small band of fanatics  and that we should avoid any military operation that might hurt innocent civilians.  Has there ever been a military operation that did not risk hurting civilians?  As a country we need to consider that this kind of fantastic tolerance and passivity might be part of the problem, and that the people that preach it may be expressing a special kind of hate, directed at themselves or their country.  We have to unite and stand up for ourselves.  There is a saying,  fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.   I am afraid of the shame I will feel if we don\'t handle this with fortitude and determination.  \"A wide and well-financed international network of extremists who hate the United States people at a religious level.  Consisting of mostly Arab Muslims but does not by any stretch include all Arab Muslims.I\'ve become more active for peace and justice.\"I cannot get over the  special effects  impression.  The whole thing still feels unreal. That the perpetrators must be stopped from committing further acts is a foregone conclusion and one which is in no danger of being overlooked. I do not believe in punishing anyone or getting revenge.  Both seem to me to be unproductive, irrational responses   acceptable, perhaps inevitable in the immediate aftermath but completely bizarre after any thought. What we need most to do is to stop the behavior of the United States and international corporations which produces such fertile soil for the growth of terrorist monsters.  The desperate will lash out. The first thing I was taught many years ago in life saving class was that a drowning person will not see you as a rescuer but as someone to climb up on to get out of the water. We need to take the lead in a global  Marshall Plan  to pull the entire world out of poverty.  We can do it. According to the Worldwatch Institute,  A report in 1998 by the United Nations Development Programme estimated the annual cost to achieve universal access to a number of basic social services in all developing countries: $9 billion would provide water and sanitation for all;  $12 billion would cover reproductive health for all women;  $13 billion would give every person on earth basic health and nutrition; and  $6 billion would provide basic education for all.  These sums are substantial, but they are still only a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars we\'re likely to spend on the  war.  And these social and health expenditures pale in comparison with what is being spent on the military by all nations-some $780 billion each year.   http://www.worldwatch.org/alerts/011009.html Without doing something to improve the state of the world, we\'ljust succeed in making more martyr, driving more people into the insanity of acts like those of Sept. 11, and creating an even larger, more desparate environment in which they can flourish. \"\"Immediately, bin Ladin and that crew.  In the long run, the rapaciousness of Europe, America, and international corporations going back a very long way.\"\"bin Ladin:  hatred, religious zeal bin Ladin\'s supporters: desperation.

Level every stone, kill every man, woman, child, animal, bacterium in the territory. Play this one like Dresden, and the next one like Hiroshima. Be careful, however, that our righteous wrath does not spill over and affect those individuals of peaceful Muslim denominations or Arab ethnicity. And that was really all I felt, till I got a sympathy e-mail from my friend Adisa. It wasn\'t the first expression of support I\'d had, but there was something especially painful about this one that made responding to it a heartrending experience, something that not only made me cry but brought me to a point of literal physical pain. You see, I was turning to Adisa not only for love and moral support, but for guidance. Adisa is Sarajevan.\"\"I\'ve made an effort to wear red, white and blue. I\'m planning to make a trip home to NYC that I otherwise would not have made, and, in my ongoing job search, I\'m emphasizing going home more than I had been.

I will be going to NY. I will look for work (and, when the question next arises, housing)in tall and/or prominent buildings. I will use airplanes, trains, whatever form of transportation I ordinarily would.   There\'s a passage from Ayn Rand\'s Atlas Shrugged that\'s been echoing in my head:  Mr. Ward, what is it that the foulest bastards on earth denounce us for, among other things?
