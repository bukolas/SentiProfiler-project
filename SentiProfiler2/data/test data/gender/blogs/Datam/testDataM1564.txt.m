Have you ever craved an ever-evolving, dynamic music library within the confines of your portable music player?  Did you ever hear a song on the radio...and then wish you could record it on the spot...even if the song was almost finished?  Do you ever get bored with choices of your stale music collection on your IPOD...and wish you had a better source for finding new music, that just isn't being played on the FM dial?
