When i got off the plan in aruba i knew it was a different place from the others we had been to in the carribean.  aruba has a constant breeze which makes the warm but not too warm weather even nicer!  the water was beautifully calm and gorgeously blue.  the food was good too!  my husband and i burn easily and yet left after a week in aruba with out a red mark on us!!
