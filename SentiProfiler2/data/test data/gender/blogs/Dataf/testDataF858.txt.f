This beautiful, bright, bold woman needs little introduction
Ms Marissa is one of the most amazing women that I have had the pleasure of meeting on MySpace.
I can't even imagine how many hours we've spent shooting the shit in my box at all hours of the day and night.
Jessie and I were talking today about how much we love Rissa. 
Jessie suggested that we all get together to show her how much she means to us all!
