So I suppose I should consider my rock star lifestyle is catching up with me. I had some sick-ass awesome insomnia in middle and high school (which ultimately lead to amazing creations and major advancement in my art due to lack of better things to do) and it's been back for the past few days or so. I just can't sleep at night, and by the time the sun comes around I'm so awake it's beyond me. I've been catching naps before work, but I'm not sure if that's helping. Maybe it's all the stress.

But what stress? I got my car back the other day, so that's great news. I got a kick ass assistant helping me find a new pad by the end of the month, and I have a nice new addition to my life *(more on that later- I can't disclose who or what it is. Not a baby tho. Cause fuck, we all know I would fuck that up).

Anyway- the point is I can't sleep at night. The only time I'm tired is from 6pm to midnight for some god fucking unreasonable reason that is a complete mystery. Wtf am I suppose to do about it? I tried to take a nap on Friday and I slept through the entire shift on accident.

This is sorta but not unlike those three weeks where I woke up every day at seven fucking am in the morning. No reason didn't matter how much prior sleep, just 7am- eyes open, and always very hungry. I thought about getting some early ass day job to fill the time.

I'm so exhausted staring at this screen at my 26th hour of awakeness. I know that if I shut my eyes I'll just be awake at 12am and the whole shitty process starts over again. Especially because I have to be some fucking where at 4pm.

My brain acts like a wild teen independent of my will.

Oh yea. I almost forgot- I totally found my "sports injury cream" and I'll be rubbing the shit out of my knees with it. Sweet sweet pain relief. They were starting to scare me with the "popping" sounds and discomfort. I can feel safe in the fact this is 2010 though, so robot knee technology is just around the corner.
