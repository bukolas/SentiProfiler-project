Now I think about the lives and trials of these women, and then my own. Will there be a reward for me, here on this earth? I don't know. There may not be. But I can't live my sick life waiting for it. It's difficult, more difficult than many can imagine. Having epilepsy, Crohn's, depression, anxiety attacks [which are the worst things on the face of the earth], nightmares, and now back pain and some kind of cold virus. I'm literally *never* healthy. But I take comfort in the fact, the knowledge I am certain of, that one day, I will be completely healed of all my ailments. And I will see Regina, and Betsy, and little Layla Grace, and they will all be healthy too, celebrating God's greatness. I look forward to that day. Until then, I wait. Something I don't like doing, but maybe I'll do some good while I'm at it.

It helps, to write my thoughts as I'm going through them. Instead of thinking about it all beforehand, just starting and writing, continuing as I realize new things. So, really, this is more for me than anyone else...
