We cruised during the week of Thanksgiving and had THE BEST TIME OF OUR LIVES as a family. Every detail was amazing, from the free arcade cards delivered to our rooms for our kids, to the guest towels folded into animal shapes. We got an amazing deal through Small World Travel (check them out online). Our family of four cruised for only $1300 total for a 4 day, 3 night cruise to Nassau and Castaway Cay. On chilly days, the crew sprang into action with trays of hot cocoa delivered to everyone.
