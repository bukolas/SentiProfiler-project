Ok, so how stinkin' cute IS this bunny?? I saw an adorable Easter sign at Hobby Lobby a few weeks ago and thought it would make a great card. I can't find the adapter that allows me to download photos from my camera phone, so I can't show you the inspiration piece. But it was an Easter bunny peeking over the top of an Easter egg.
