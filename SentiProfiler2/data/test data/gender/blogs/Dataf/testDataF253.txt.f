Oh wow, it's been awhile my blogger buddies! Sorry it's been so long, I've been very busy! We are starting to potty train Shaylee....it's going pretty well, she hasn't really peed in the potty but she has gone "Number two" almost everyday in her potty. She just needs to know the feeling of when she has to pee....it might take awhile! Things have been good here, John is working like crazy....as usual! He'll have a nice break over new years though. Shayle is still loving school, Next year she'll be headed for Kindergarten. My monroe is healed and I LOVE IT!! I get so many compliments on it, it feel like second skin, I hardly feel it. It's so stinking cute! I messed up my hair for the holidays too.....I cut BANGS....short kindergarten mom cut my bangs...bangs. EEEK! Sooo..... With Christmas coming up at light speed....I have a few of my favorite Christmas things to share.
