Islamic banks have been operating like other traditional bank about four decades. They also mobilize deposits and produce loans based on Islamic Law (Shari'ah), which are different from the other conventional or commercial banks. Therefore, Islamic banking differs from conventional banking in several ways, such as the prohibition of transactions based on interest rate and the requirement that bank's operations be carried out according to certain procedures through the use of certain financial instruments (1). However, the Islamic bank can also offer products and services which are similar to those offered by a conventional bank.  Generally, we can define the Islamic bank as a non-interest based financial institution which complies fully with Islamic Laws and has creative and progressive financial engineering to offer efficient and competitive banking, investment, trade finance, commercial and real estate financing services (1). There are approximately 180 Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions operating in Asia, Africa, Europe and the USA with more than 8,000 branches with an estimated $170 billion (2).

The popularity of the Islamic banking system is not limited to the Islamic banks only. Increasingly large international conventional banks are showing interest in the Islamic banking system as well (2). The consequence of this is that Islamic banks operating in Islamic countries are faced with strong competition not only from Islamic banks but also from non-Islamic rivals (3). When competition intensifies and when banks start to offer more or less similar products and services, it is the customer's satisfaction that can influence the performance of an Islamic bank and determines its competitiveness and success. Hence, it is of paramount importance to assess the degree of customer satisfaction towards Islamic banks operating in Islamic countries.
