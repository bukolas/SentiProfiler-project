Minorities no longer want equality. They want control and thanks to the bleeding heart, politically correct, government-corporate regime, they're getting it. Whites are not allowed to have pride in our race. To the culture of blame, we're expected to tread lightly upon eggshells for these inhuman wastes of DNA. If the truth be known, there is a silent majority of Americans who dare not speak out because there is much to risk by doing so. Loss of employment, even jail. The truth is- most black people are a thousand times more racist than any white person. I see it every day. I work around it. If you're white and live in the south you know exactly what I mean. They've made a mockery of their own civil rights movement. They've abandoned it because there are levels of appeasement which they have learned to exploit via playing the race card to get what they want with a minimum of effort. What a luxury that must be. I believe that, eventually, the politically correct masses will have to be dragged from their stagnant slumber of utter denial by force. If we ever want to restore this nation to it's rightful level of power. We're a weakened nation right now. The government has allowed the Mexican cockroaches to infest our society. This has jarred many people out of their slumber but not nearly enough. Mark my words. There are underground organizations gaining strength and numbers by the day. The government has a right to be nervous. (like in the DHS memo they issued a while back) We're armed, pissed off and we've had enough. It's a grim prospect that the next major war needs to be fought on our own soil but it has to be done. Never surrender.
