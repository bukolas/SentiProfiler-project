"My comments about movie theaters aside, I'm going to see this. I don't like the trailer. But I do like Queen Latifah. And I love the Negroes at Court Street in Bk. (""Bitch got thrown! Bitch got thrown!!"") I actually troll the bad black rom-com DVDs in search of half-decent material. Every once in a while you come with a goodie. Breaking All The Rules is really underrated. And the world will not be truly postracial until you see a flick like The Seat Filler is in theaters, and The Ugly Truth is straight to DVD. There's a good convo going on below about my post earlier this week on Ben Roethlisberger. I think the take-away, for me, is that this a post that should have stayed in my head, and off the page. We all have our musings, and the kind of conversation we might have over beers with friends. But That's very different than posting something on the Atlantic's website.

For me the salient facts are as follows: I have no idea what happened, and in such an instance, it's almost never a good idea to start publicly riffing. Rape is a serious accusation, and a kind of crime that presents a specific problem to those who like to bat these kind of things around. I'm not convinced that my contribution to the conversation--absent of any real facts--actually helps anyone, or clarifies anything

Look, I'm a football fan with a particular curiosity about the justice system. This case obviously appeals to my interests. But, on reflection, I don't think I had anything of substance to add. There are limits to living in your own head. Likewise, there are limits your ability to discern between your occasional thoughts and writing with substance. I failed on that count here. 

While we're in full apology mode, I've been informed by a couple people that ""Streisand"" is actually an old-school homophobic slur. This highlights the importance of only riffing off jokes that you actually understand. My apologies to all. I would change the post's title. But that feels deceptive.

Anyway, I'm leaving comments off. I think that's enough meta analysis and navel-gazing for one day. Let's not make worse. I think I have some sense of why this whole conversation might be frustrating. Rape has a psychological element that thrives on shame. In our justice system the burden is always on the accuser, but that burden falls especially hard when there are significant disincentives to reporting the crime, and testifying about it. Sexual assault is humiliating, and no one really wants to relive that humiliation. Moreover, I think getting accused of sexual assault twice raises some basic human suspicions. 

But that said, I'm not exactly sure what to do here. I think we all find the presumption of innocence to be essential. With that in mind--What, specifically, should we be saying? How should we be talking about the anonymous accuser? What, specifically, constitutes taking alleged sexual misconduct seriously? Should we really be in the business of denouncing ""alleged crimes?"" Was the rush to condemn in the Duke Rape Case excusable?"
