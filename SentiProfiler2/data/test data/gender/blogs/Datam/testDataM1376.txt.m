What a game! It was one of the best Final's I have seen in a while and India played brilliantly to clinch the First Twenty Twenty World Cup defeating Pakistan. So the record of not losing to Pak in any WC still holds.

Watched every ball of this match with nail biting excitement. India has this knack of putting themselves in difficult situations when it should have been an easy wrap up. During Pak batting the game was mostly in India's favor except for the last 20 balls when Bajji and Sreeshanth were hit for 5 sixes. When will India learn to bowl well in the last overs? But they held their nerve and pulled it off.

Hats off to Dhoni and the young Indian team!!! They really were winners!!!
