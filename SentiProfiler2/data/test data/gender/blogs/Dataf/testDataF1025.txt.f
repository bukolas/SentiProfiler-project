Spring is in the air...you know what that means...no not cleaning!

Ah Spring.  Spring is in the air.  Birds are chirping, mud puddles are overflowing and a girl's thoughts turn to ... well boys.  Admit it!  Spring brings a certain 'randyness' to mind - no? 

Every time I write an entry, I see a select list of categories to choose from and 'Dating' is the first one that Jen set up for me.  I never check it off.  And I mean NEVER.  And it glares back at me daily, a constant reminder that my 90 year old grandfather is currently getting more action than me.

Dating scares me.  It brings me back to being a terrified fifteen year old girl with a bad anxiety disorder.  My first 'date' was a lunch with an older guy at school.  We went to Apache Burger where all the cool kids hung out and I promptly threw up from nerves.  It hasn't really gotten better since then.  I'm sort of a dicotomy - I'm outgoing and confident in regular life but give me a first date and I'm a nervous wreck doing vodka shots when the doorbell rings.

In my pre-baby life I used to write a blog that was carried on radio station sites across the country.  It was called WTF and it basically dealt with my ridiculous life - part of it was dating.  People turned it to read deets of the guy who looked like Franklin the turtle and asked to watch hockey in his undies; the writer who humped my leg like a poodle; or the guy who filmed me bowling.  I may have not had a typical 'relationship' for the past decade but I had been having fun.

I've been on one date since I've had Will and I have to admit it my nerves were a little bit better.   I'll attribute this to my care factor of success being much lowered. 

Face it, if the night goes bad...I no longer go home to my empty house and bemoan about it.  I can go home and open Will's door and see the greatest guy ever sleeping like a champ. 

 

 

 

So I've decided to take matters into my own hands and set up an online dating profile.  The thought makes me cringe as I thoroughly believe that 'my type' of guy doesn't do online dating.  BUT - let's face it has my 'type' been working - yeah not so much.  I figure if nothing else, it's fodder for the blog right?
