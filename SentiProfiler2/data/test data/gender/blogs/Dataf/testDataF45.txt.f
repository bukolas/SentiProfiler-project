A Letter to Life! Dear Life,

I know you will always do well unless a more treacherous thing than you ditches you. Keep up the game you play every day. The video game of my life is very exciting with each door leading to more pitfalls and just one real door(that is hidden) ;)

Wow, you are awesome! you have a different and new game set everyday for each breathing creature alive! I wonder as to how do you do this. Ambidextrous are you and reminds me of Goddess Durga. Are you really her?

Would like to know more about your multitasking programs and algorithms written since time unknown. Do let me know. Will keep the secret well hidden! Kudos :)

Last but not the least, the list of your fan following is huge. The fans are sort of freaked out in the video games you designed for them so they could not convey their love for you. Some of them are lost in transition through the Bermuda Triangles created in their games by you.

With much enthusiam to see much more,
Love
Nupur (a lover of the video game of my life)
