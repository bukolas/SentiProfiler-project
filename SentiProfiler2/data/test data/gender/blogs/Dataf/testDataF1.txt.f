The schedule is bananas and I haven't had time to do ANYTHING yet! I'm hoping to catch a break tonight or tomorrow afternoon to get on my computer, clean out my email inbox and upload a few pics. So exciting! The kids are having a blast and the tour we are on is SICK.

It's a tour you can't BUY - It's only available through the CEO of Disney. We are being brought in through exits of rides and they are closing down stuff for us to eat in at night. They are supplying snacks and taking us into shows without having to wait on lines. It is incredible!! Oh and we can go on rides a few times - not just once. We get off and then hop right on again. People are very confused watching us!

They have this purple card that they show which is like SUPER DUPER VIP - they said it's how the celebs go through the park. I swear - it is SICK!!

Will update more later.
