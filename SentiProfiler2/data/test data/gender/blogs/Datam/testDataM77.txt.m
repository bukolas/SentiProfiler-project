Break up :( - well after two blogs which were depressing and political and i know many people do not have any interest in politics. Now you must be thinking politics was less depressing than break up (if you have gone through it).Well before break up I wanted to go through the journey of love. What is love? According to oxford dictionary love is an intense feeling of deep affection and great interest in something or someone. But what I guess is that while I am writing this blog really I am not having any words to describe it. really it is an awesome feeling . really yaar its just a great feeling, your life changes.
You travel through ups and downs of life during love. well I wanted to say I do not think that break up is a depressing word. What do you think of? A very great philosopher said that “true love starts when nothing is looked for in return”. So if you are a true lover then praise break up also .you must be thinking that I have gone mad but what I want to say is that why to live in illusion when you have the option to cut it out.
Please do not think that I am encouraging everyone for break up. I just want to say that please do not make love a burden. It is a gift given by god. If you are not in true love you will feel that you were in a mess. I used to believe in first sight love and still I do in spite of the fact that mostly first sight love is infatuation. Please do not go for love on basis of appearance. It is my request. Somethings are ought to be attained with patience. Look for the better part of break up. Understand each other better. Make sure that this is the person you are looking for and bells must be ringing for the person in your heart .
Well after a long lesson I am just sorry if I have offended any body. Please forgive me it was just overflow of emotions. Do not take it otherwise 
