If you'd been wondering if Draft Blogger was worth trying, any doubts should be erased right now. You need Draft Blogger to take advantage of the new template design features currently in beta. Truly, this is not something to wait for it to be released into Blogger proper. The thing is as flexible as can be. Not only are there 4 basic new templates, each with a few versions, but most of them let you change the background to one of a large variety of designs or stock photos.The fun doesn't end there. You can also customize the layout, and by customizing, I mean you can customize the overall layout of the blog's body and then pick a layout for the footer, which allows for a whole lot of variations. You can also vary the widths of the blog and the sidebars. Then you can move around your page elements/gadgets and choose colors if you don't like the defaults, and you have control over background colors for the page as well as for the gadgets, links, text, etc. As before, you can add in any header image you want, using the header element/gadget. I would think you can also use your own background images if you upload them somewhere, ie to Picasa, by going into the html and coding it in place of the images that come with the template. I haven't tried that yet.
