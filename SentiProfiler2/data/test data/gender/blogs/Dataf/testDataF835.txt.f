Living in a bicycle-friendly town like I do, I can live without the hassles and expense of owning a car because I use Zipcar for mega-buying and out of town adventures. Zipcar takes care of the maintenance and insurance and gives a generous allowance for gas (they provide a gas card and up to 180 miles per 24-hour reservation). It's also fun having a variety of cars to drive; most in my university town are compact, but there is also an SUV when needed.
