My ADHD kicks in almost exclusively when I'm dealing with abstract situations. I believe that in an earlier Treating Adult ADD Blog posting I mentioned my perhaps-Romantic attraction to craftsmanship, and my regrets that I'd not pursued, say, tool-and-die making or furniture building in my youth. (Saying, "I believe…I mentioned" means, as those of you who stop by this stand regularly know, that I may have done so, may not have done so, may think I've done so but haven't or may think I haven't but have. Or that the whole megillah is a fabrication. Fabrication. That's a woodworking joke. Right? OK. I'm moving, officer, I'm moving.) Whatever the antecedents, it's worth mentioning again (or not again…WHAT! NOT AGAIN!!!) why I'm attracted to benchwork. The simple version is that in my case, the ADHD kicks in almost exclusively when I'm dealing with abstract situations. (And, as I wrote in my blog the other day, when I'm dealing cards.) (Sorry about all the parens, but there was this going-out-of-business sale at the local Font Hacienda last week and…[obviously, the ellipses {…«which, FYI, are properly set as a single character (and these double arrow thingies are called guillemets and the French use them as "quotation marks")»}] but we can start our discussion of typography some other time, OK?). zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry. It's tiring, balancing all those parens (that's a proofreader's joke, son). Well, obviously typing doesn't count as craftsmanship because you can see how far down the slippery slope I've already skidded here. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go for a walk now and see if I can get all of these random glyphs out of my head. I'll be back shortly, and we can talk about "curly quotes" which the stupid lines around "curly quotes" aren't. And then we can get back to marquetry. And tool-and-die making. And locksmithing. Honey, do you remember if I took my Concerta this morning?
