Hmm…what do I say about this Buddy!! :)
Highly trustworthy, very caring , very very intelligent...
and more than any thing my TEAM LEAD( May be youngest TL)
Man!!…his Tech skills are just awesome! Nobody can beat him in a debate or a GD:))
A very lively guy..u will not know how time passes when u r with him.He is one of the most jovial person around in my office.
(Wonder what he’s doin in his job?!..Hey Rama!..though u r always awesomely busy…u still have time for me, u guide me, listen to my problems, make me comfortable with my work............. thanks a lot for all that Care !!)
He is the pillar of the flowthru team, and is responsible for all the good metrics the team has. AND he is Father of FAE...... his blood is filled with FAE, ofcourse just an outcome of his technical thirst.
And inspite of having such superb qualities..he’s so down to earth!
Here is someone who understands me completely.
Thanks Rama!...for being one of my best buddies!
