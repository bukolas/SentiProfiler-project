................When I woke up in the morning I always become aware of my thoughts and feelings and work to 'shift' whatever it is that may not be what it is that I am wanting to attract. Usually it just takes a sec and the beautiful thoughts arrive as I hold onto them and go about my day.

This morning my mind was going a million miles an hour and it was not comfortable! as I laid there the ugly thoughts kept showing up! Frustrated I pulled the covers over my head, closed my eyes real hard and tried to focus on something good. Still the sickness feeling was there and I began to get annoyed that it was more difficult than normal. 

Then it hit me as I thought of my friend Kat's birthday today then realized what day it is!!! 

A Year ago today my life was changed forever!! A year ago today I felt terror like i have never experienced before or after. A year ago today was the best and worse day of my life. A year ago today my husband shot himself after trying to kill us both. A year ago today my Husband gave me the greatest gift ever. My freedom!!!! A year ago today I gave my word to Tony (the sheriff) that I would make good out of the bad and I have!!!
