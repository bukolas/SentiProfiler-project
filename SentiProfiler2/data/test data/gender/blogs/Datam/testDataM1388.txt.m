I took some heat in e-mail and here on our comments section for my recent piece about what I saw as fanboy whining over the Captain America casting process, and I want to clarify something... I don't think fandom is a bad thing.  I think it is the thermometer by which we measure the passion for various properties or characters, and that's a great thing.  I also think fandom, when focused, can be an incredibly valuable force in the process, and this is one of those times.  I think it becomes "whining" when you're second-guessing something you can't accurately judge because you haven't see the materials, when you don't know how an audition went, or when you simply leap to a conclusion from an emotional place.  In the case of Norton's Banner, you already have some sense of what he brings to the role.  The real question now is, "Do you consider him a piece of the puzzle, and do you want him back?"  If the answer is yes, then I think it's time to clearly communicate that to Marvel.
