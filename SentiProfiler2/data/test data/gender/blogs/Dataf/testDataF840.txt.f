How dare they (the media) come on the morning news shows and show webcam pics of the beach off the Hilton, bright and sunny, beckoning, promising, and then tell us that it is but forty nine out, and the blessed Gulf waters are 55 degrees. What kind of glory to know that this is the coldest March since such records were kept.

I go out to do morning barn chores wearing my pajamas. No kidding. Beneath my jeans and sweat shirt and puffy jacket and ski cap, and the only gloves I have are flowered gardening gloves, I wear my pajamas. Even the horses hardly know me, fat with clothes like the Michelin Man.

There was frost on the grass, and no sign of the tortoise that has taken up residence near the Magnolia tree. They dig holes, tunnels, mazes beneath the earth, and I never know from which "door" it will emerge. The barn cats sit on the tin roof to gain warmth from the meagre rays of the sun. The horses do not mind the cold, but seem quite comfortable in their fuzzy winter coats. They nuzzle the thin cover of ice from the water trough to drink, and munch quite happily on the frosted pasture.

The robins are drunk all through the yard, from eating the berries off the Brazilian Pepper trees. I doubt they will sober up until April for their flight north. A few are so besotted, I have to step carefully as I cross the lawn in order not to step on them. Fortunately, my spoiled fat cat is too full to bother them.

But, as cold as it is here, I feel for my kin in the true north. The house there has had frozen water pipes for a month (they get their water for use from the spigot at the pump.  ) The man of the house goes to the gym after work so he can shower.

The worst I heard was when my daughter called to say the dog was frozen to the driveway.  It's a little and spoiled dog, and coming out from the warm warm house to do her morning "chores", and stood for a moment on the concrete driveway to bark at a squirrel,, and thus froze to the concrete. My daughter had to bring a pan of warm water out and pour it on her feet to free her.  It was minus ten at the time.

Still. It seems a dang cold winter that is hanging on far too long, EVERYWHERE.
