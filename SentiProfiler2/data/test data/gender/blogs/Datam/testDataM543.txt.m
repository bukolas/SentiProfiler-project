CONTINUATION...
today,after almost 8 yrs since then i find him with the same energy and verve...everfresh and cheerful.he has been thro' my thick and thin all these years(and i badly needed him,more so, during my lean periods to guide me through)..he gives everything to keep his friends and loved ones (oops! sorry) loved one i meant happy.he has been my mentor in almost all walks of my life(except for cricket though where its the other way round..hehehe..no jus joking.he is a great batsman and i adore him there too).he is good at managing situations,his arguments are unbeatable..his smile goes a mile and settles ur nerves.well for all the attributes that he has got,to have his head firmly resting on his shoulders is something that is worth a mention...
and now to the critic part of it..
he is too fussy about his food(jus like me though)...he is a bit lazy is an understatement..and he never lies..ya he weighs 65kg and afridi is the best cricketer in the world.
thanx for being the way you are da..
