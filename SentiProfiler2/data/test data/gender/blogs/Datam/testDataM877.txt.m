This is the best car I've ever had! No probs beyond routine maintenance. It's tall enough to see over traffic, and fast enough to zip through it smoothly. It's a bit narrow - can't rest my elbow on the window ledge as I was used to - but I can live with that. Mileage is great for a traditional vehicle: 23-26 mpg. Cargo capacity is remarkable, too. The back seats can be folded down or removed. A neat added feature are the hooks in the back for hanging grocery bags.
