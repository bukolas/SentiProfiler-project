Shopping that is environmentally friendly and easy on the pocket?? Why that would be a clothes swap party my friend! Yes as the Fashion society at Uni we decided to host one this week. Basically you brings some of your clothes that you no longer wear along and then swap them for somebodys else's castaways et voila you have new gear that didn't cost you a penny! You know what they say one man's rubbish is another's riches...(that is what they say, right?). Well anyway it was very successful, I got myself a lovely new bag and jumper out of the deal. I would highly recommend you all try it.
I also booked my flights to London with my girls yesterday! We are heading for a short break in the easter hols to treat ourselves to plenty of shopping, sight seeing and show stopping adventures. Camden market is on my list of top 5 places in the entire world, so I am very excited to be going back! It's such a mesmerising place, so diverse and exciting. And they have the best doughnut stand I have ever seen. I'm tres excited!
