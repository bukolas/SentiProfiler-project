XPU Ha Don´t worry be happy from David Furchtgott on Vimeo . As we were driving into our house, I was listening, to the song " Don´t Worry , be Happy ", and, It is unbelievable, to think back, and to see how much we have achieved out of a dream... we started of a tree in Xpu Ha, just sitting down with a kite waiting for the wind, planning to have a Sabatical season... and look where we are now... Thank you very much for the support! I´m looking forward to see what is next! Keep it Real, Keep it Morph! Thank you Ben, for taking the time to shoot this pictures and also edit them in your holidays! very nice!, he was taking this pictures side by side with Chantelle, he was " embarrased " to give me this pictures, because he says that he can not compete with Chantelle´s session, however, I told him, that every photographer has a pint of view, also that he doesn´t have the big monster camera as Chantelle does, but his pictures are awesome as well, and every picture is different, every eye is deifferent, so Ido appreciate a lot your pics Ben! when I took him a picture to post in the blog, he says : don´t take a picture of e I´m going to be horrible in that picture..... I took the picture of him and when he saw it, he told me: you see? JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU....HORRIBLE!!! JAJAJA! anyway MOn Ami, Merci Beaucoup!!! saludos! este dia nos sopló bastante bien, el viento, estaba más o menos como 15 nudos de dirección Noreste, Yanick, empezó a armar su EH Beast V3, de 6 m2, mientras yo le ayudaba a estirar sus líneas. esto fue en la escuela de kitesurfing de Morph en la playa de Xpu Ha, Yanick vino con varios de sus amigos de Cancun, pero él fué el único que continuó con su entrenamiento. hoy seguimos con el trainer, y Yanick ya tiene muchísimo control con su papalote! ahora ya está dando giros, vueltas, kiteloops! etc, al final de la tarde nos terminamos la arrachera, y fué un buen final de dia en Xpu ha... Andrés, fué el fotógrafo de éste dia. thank you very much por las fotos Amigo! and also thank you for the Tacos de Carnitas! that was a nice experience! saludos! Buenas Tardes David, I trust you are well and business is growing! It was great meeting you on the beach in January. I had a lot of fun photographing you kiteboarding and listening to your passionate words about your sport. You're setting a powerful example. I would have liked to have accepted your invitation for lessons before leaving on our journey to weave together the prophecies of the Maya and Inka at the sacred sites of Tulum, Coba, Chichen Itza, and Ek Balam. I didn't have the space to stop by this time and will build room into my schedule when I return. It was pretty different, almost difficult, coming back to Sweden with a temperature of -20 C compared to the +28 C in Tulum. Three journeys to Tulum in the last 15 months and looking forward to returning as soon as possible. You have a beautiful country and the land speaks to me. It would be cool to meet up with some kiteboarding folks here in Stockholm. I appreciate any connections you may have. Thank you. As agreed David, here are some of the photos that I took that afternoon. They are small at 72dpi to keep the email size low. Left me know if you would like any in a larger size. I join ed Morph Kiteboarding group on FB when I saw it the other day. Warm regards, Scott as I´m coming out of the Xpu Ha Palapa, I see Francoise, writting something, as I approach I can spy that he is studying the wind window! good for you man! I love to see people thirsty for knowledge! I actually don´t even think he knows I took his picture.. saludos ! Nokia Morph Concept from Ozan Basar on Vimeo . Read more about...
