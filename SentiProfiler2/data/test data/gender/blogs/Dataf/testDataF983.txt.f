After a fantastic three weeks of roadtripping across Texas and into New Mexico with Andrew, we got thrown the biggest curveball yet!
Having decided to set up shop in Austin, I did not expect to get a call back from a company who had originally passed me over for a great job. Here's the time table on this one:
Last week, they call while Andrew is napping in the car in Spring to tell me nix.
I turn to him and say, no need to apply to a Houston school, 'We're moving to Austin!'
April 1 Andrew flies back to London to prepare his apartment, visa, etc. for his August move.
Consequently, April 1 was also the deadline for UH
April 2 The company calls me to tell me they liked me so much they created a new role for me!
Phew. Ugh. Wow. So the money is in Houston. The career building job is in Houston. But Andrew can't go to school in Houston. And building a lif together was the whole point.
A late night (for him) call last night brought a lot of comfort. 'We can handle curve balls. It's what we've been doing all along. And we'll hit this one out of the park, too.'
What a fantastic person I've found!
