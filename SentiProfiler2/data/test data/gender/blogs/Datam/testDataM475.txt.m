If you have children then this becomes an additional dimension to consider. It's generally better for children to grow-up in a family with their parents in the same house. The exception to this is when there's an environment of abuse, danger or emotional stress. Before you decide to walk out on your wife and kids, consider the children and whether it's possible to resolve your differences. Only if that's absolutely impossible and the family environment is worse if you stay together than if you split up, should you even consider leaving.
