salaam ppl. tayiboon: the moment a Muslim even kills a fly, the media/animal rights/human rights/etc. speak against Islam and the Muslim!!! this is true, being a 'muslim', in more than name only, is a hot potato at the moment. truefat: Media tend not to spend much time and effort in deep socio-economico-political analysis and just take those claims at face value. this compounds the problem for muslims n automatically villifies them in the eyes of all the masses. media attacks on islam are nothing new i.e. bluto from popeye was supposed to be a typical arab stereotype. so the problem is that the masses of ppl are like sheep n the media is their shepherd. at the moment the shepherd is saying the muslims r the hungry wolves. true fat: If you take the Vietnam war, on the other hand, it wasn't conceived or widely presented as a "Christian" war. Yes, the Vietcong was considered anti-Christian, but the main emphasis was on defense of the "Free World" against Communist totalitarianism. the major Christian Churches were not involved in this war, and to a certain extent supported indeed peace movements, or tried to mediate. absolutely agree with u, it was never a christian led conflict, the church is not to blame n nor is christianity. they fought in the name of 'freedom' i.e. to impose democratic values on the vietnamese and to 'liberate' them from the equally powerful, at the time, communism. most major wars are just this i.e. a battle for supremacy of one ideology over another and for resources etc, regardless of how the conflict is dressed up. true fat: There is absolutely nothing which unites non-Muslims: no common ideology, religion, history, values, political project, level of economic development... element of truth but this just means ur sheep being led by the shepherd n this cant be denied ie. look how easy it is to whip ppl up in a frenzy via the media. for example the pearl harbour incident led to the americans attacking japan, even though there is research to suggest the vessel was purposefully sunk by the americans to go to war i.e. just to get public support. so until disbelievers have a common purpose, its a case of the blind leading the blind i.e. capitalism is unsustainable, the earth is being raped etc. sooner or later i'm pretty sure those in power will make a new man made system to rule over us i.e. one world gov't etc. therefore to liberate urselves from ur current predicament of being pushed around, i'd suggest you open ur heart to the quran. ask urself how is it that the knowledge contained in the quran is still relevant and applicable to this day i.e. no need for revised editions etc. so don't be repelled by social conditioned reactions n acknowledge the truth. truth stands out from falsehood. ps no offence for the true fat thing. repairman: This whole thread seems as inane as stating "My superiority complex is greater than your superiority complex." ha ha well said. in reality all ism's have blood on their hands, including muslims. mankind needs to relax a little, the doctors r luving it at the moment, seeling prescribing stress n depression pills to the masses. theres no need for it. as usual mans desire for power, pride, ego n misuse n rejection of divine scriptures to follow their desires, is causing bloodshed. ppl shud just stop the naughtiness n be sincere.
