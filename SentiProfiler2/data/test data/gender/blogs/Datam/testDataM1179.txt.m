I changed my watch. I wore a pair of shoes that had been ignored for long. I attended to my car repair personally. While driving to Jalsa I reprimanded a traffic offender. I sang along with the FM radio jock as one of my favorites belted itself out from the speakers on the car. I checked the electricals in the house that were giving us a problem. I unpacked and laid out the various gifts presented to me from the Oman Excellencies. I fixed my computer, discovering during the course that I had been using the wrong cable box for my internet connection. I made calls to people that I had been avoiding for sometime. And I watched the IPL with great delight. And I discovered that this was all due to the fact that I pushed myself to a work- out in the morning, despite the vagaries of the  previous night. I am content and painless - both in body and mind now. And I believe that this has come about by the simple fact of putting my body back into routine. When you miss the routine, the essentials of everyday, the spasms of life shall forever bother you and become a hindrance. I had subjected my body to much malaise and lethargy. Lethargy brings about defeat. It nurtures weakness in our confidence and the urge to move forward.
