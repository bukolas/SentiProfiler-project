UGH! I cannot believe how late I am with this! We had such a busy week last week! We had something going everyday! Needless to say I didn't spend much time on the computer. (That might be a good thing!) Since we have already finished our first week of our 2 week menu I am just going to post this week's menu. I will do better next time! I promise!
