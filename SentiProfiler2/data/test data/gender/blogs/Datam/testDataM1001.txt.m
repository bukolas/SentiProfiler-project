I'm sitting here at eleven thirty at night thinking about what to write. I started to write something but it wasn't "Gigglemedicine" appropriate. I'm not trying to be funny I want this blog to be natural not contrived but comedy and tragedy are connected. I could go off on a some witty examples: comedy and tragedy like Alien and Aliens, Peter Sellers and Steve Martin the Guess Who and Come back! I think you get it. 
  I was up watching "Behind Enemy Lines" on Spike. I was inspired to play with the premise:
"Apathy."  I don't know if my indifference came from watching Owen Wilson in a War movie or watching the Oilers lose their fifteenth game in a row with three seconds left. But here I am locked on indifference.
   I like the premise. If I can get up in a stage and say I feel nothing. That's a better place then being the wonky Sea Monkey - that comedian that's on auto pilot. I love comedy. Even after all these years I can hop in a 78 Taurus and burn across the prairies . I'm not worried about the destination. God will tell me the punch line.
   I've never really thought about being discovered. And what does that mean? Like how hard was it for that guy who discovered the Moon? "There's Ted he pointed up."
I've had twenty plus years in Comedy I teach it and I still feel like my big  comedy discoveries
 are in front of me- I know what they are: letting go, moving into the unknown, rehearsing, being prepared. I'll keep chipping away it's right around the corner inside a 78 Taurus.
