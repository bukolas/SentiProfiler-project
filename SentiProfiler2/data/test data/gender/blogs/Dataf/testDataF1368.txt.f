W elcome to the February 28, 2010 edition of Easy Street Carnival of Writing and Art. There was an electronic mountain of submissions this month. Sadly, most of them had little to do with original writing and art. What kept me going were the lovely submissions that did follow the guidelines and here they are. Do stop by their blogs to offer congratulations and encouragement. Creative Nonfiction Sarah Clark presents Sarah...Phenomenally: Divorce and Metamorphosis posted at Sarah...Phenomenally . Yvaine presents Too Much Snow posted at My Vanilla Nook , saying, "Snow is good, but you can only take so much." Fiction MaxwellDB presents Lake Ontario posted at MaxwellDB , saying, "Lake Ontario is a short science fiction story. It's an objectively-written piece about a man alone on Titan, one of Saturn's moon. He is a cog in an automated research machine-- something that causes him great difficulty." Tessa presents my roommate Â« kajoemanis posted at kajoemanis . drukdude presents The Fellowship of the Null-pointer | Story Collection posted at Story Collection , saying, "Spontaneous Short Stories by strangers gathered on the train!"

Poetry Madeleine Begun Kane presents Super Bowl Sunday Blues posted at Mad Kane's Humor Blog . ThoughtsBlogger presents Life's Defiants posted at Random Thoughts , saying, "A poem about the things that keep us going in the fight that is life." Robert Terrell presents galactic dreamers ? haiku posted at the existential poet , saying, "The Existential Poet Blog contains my original haiku poetry. I maintain a strict form, the 5-7-5 syllable structure, which suits my poetic creativity very well. I write about all sorts of subjects, with an existential (human feelings) attitude. Many of my haiku have seasonal references, and many focus on inner states of being. And, I love moon haiku!" That concludes this edition.
