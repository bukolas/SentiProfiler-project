I spent a lot of time last week cogitating about the topic for my next blog. The ideas that crossed my mind ranged from the mirthful experiences in my college (in continuation of my first blog) to the heavy ones like ‘Hindutva’. I also thought of writing about my blissful life in school but later decided against it. As I sat down to write about anything which inaugurates my thought process, a much uncomplicated idea came to my mind about the most cherubic and audacious (arguably) person on this heavenly planet. Yes, I am going to write few things about my angelic Mother (though in a slap-stick way!!). Well I am not going to discourse the love that is shared in the mother-child relationship (for that you can always listen to the famous song from Taare Zameen Par). What I am going to talk about here are rules that every mother sets in her house to keep a check on people living under her domain (well in my case, this kingdom consists of me, my brother and dad too!!).
