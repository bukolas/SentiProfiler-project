I'm on the train as I type heading to Chicago on my way to meet up with Betsy Greer for programing at Columbia College this afternoon. It's so easy to forget that Milwaukee is only 1.5 hours away from Chicago, even after 9 years of living here it slips my mind. I can't wait to catch up with Betsy, I can't remember the last time we saw each other...But I think it was at the Portland premier of Handmade Nation last Spring. Man a year sure goes by quick. East coast peeps tell your friends that on Monday evening (March 8th) I'll be doing a screening at Syracuse University in the Watson Auditorium at 5:15pm, FREE &amp; open to the public. Have a good weekend everyone! I'm at my hotel in Baltimore . Just had a great screening at MICA that was full of really great folks. Tomorrow I head back to Milwaukee (fingers crossed the weather stays on my side) until next Thursday. In international news I just received a pdf from Vida Simples Magazine who did an article on DIY featuring the picture of Knitta &amp; Happy Owl Glassworks from Handmade Nation the book and also Sabrina's book Knit Knit . AND AND AND I got my tickets for my trip to Scotland this June where I will be doing screenings and workshops in Aberdeen and Dundee ! I am SO excited, I've never been to Scotland and can not wait to soak it in. Next Thursday I will be on a train to Chicago to the Cultural Studies Colloquium at Columbia College Chicago with my friend and colleague Betsy Greer . The programing starts at 3:30 with a screening of Handmade Nation and lecture by Betsy. It's free and open to the public. I'm off to slumber land, the wind here in Baltimore is howling louder then hounds. Quite down wind, this lady is sleepy. Well, it was official before but now with a new blog , twitter, flickr and facebook fan page it's the real deal. I start shooting with my co-director Sam Macon the end of March for the Sign Painter Movie . For those of you who are interested you can now download Handmade Nation from Amazon.com I haven't tried it, but here it is: I will be hitting the road again on Thursday jumping a flight West to San Francisco. I am staying with the lovely Lisa Congdon and will be screening in Oakland at Rock! Paper! Scissor! this Friday at 7pm. Do pass the word on and hope to see you soon! Part of my job is to stay on top of what's new and exciting going on within the creative world. I have found this to become more and more difficult as I struggle to keep up with Handmade Nation and the amazing opportunities that have come out of making the documentary, including the immense travel schedule that has become a part of my life. There is just so much out there, you know? So many of you are making exciting new things and documenting them in such beautiful ways. So my question is, where is the time in my day/week/month to read all of your blogs, ingest all your amazing lifestyles and inspiration? I mean, it's not like I'm out of touch at all, it's just that there is so much more than I can wrap my brain around. With this said, a few weeks ago Jan from Poppytalk (one of my favorite reliable blogs) got in touch as asked me to be a juror along with some other amazing ladies for her new awards she set up called " The Poppies ". Of course I said yes. The thing is, I often say yes to things I don't have time for but really want to do and per usual, I didn't think about the time involved with going through what ended up being 100's of links of those who were nominated for the categories. As a juror we were asked to pick 3 out of each category. Each category had anywhere from 20-50 nominations. There were so many amazing things and people who I hadn't seen before, it was really difficult to stay focused while clicking through all the nominee's. I had to develop a system so I could narrow it down a bit, so I made lists for each category of my favorite picks to then pick 3 from. The entire point of this post is to share with you my lists I made. I think there was so much talent showcased for the Poppies and if you want to see the jury choice winners go here. and the people's choice winners go here . Below are my "working" lists from when I was in the zone of going through 100's of blogs, shops and sites. I got really inspired &amp; hope you do too. Unfortunately I used my "stickies" to save my lists and they didn't save the hyperlinks, but I have linked each category to it's page so just scroll down once on each page and peep away!

The reasons I do love it is because I like finding out about things like " Typeface ". This is a new documentary (I have yet to see) about a very special place that just so happens to be in Wisconsin only a few hours away from me. This trailer is a kick in the butt to make my way up there very very soon. Keep an eye out on their website for screenings near you. Also, head on over to Blanket Magazine to download the new issue . It's not just any issue it's their 20th &amp; also the 3rd Birthday of the Magazine! You can see this feature with your's truly as well as interviews and artwork by a ton of people. There is also an amazing spread on jumping photos, which I am always a huge fan of (see below). A screen shot of my spread in Blanket Magazine Here I am jumping on my bed in Melbourne last year My time out East was fantastic. Like, super tops in all manners. Here is the quickest rundown possible of my 5 day jam packed trip. This is a long one.... January 15th, Day #1: The show I curated " New Work by Merrilee Challiss and Margaret Oomen " at Craftland Gallery opened. Merrilee flew in from Alabama and we all got to hang out. The show looks amazing, the work is stunning and I'm glad my hunch for showing those two together was correct. Read more about the experience here . Margaret Oomen, covered sea stones Margaret Oomen, covered tea saucers Merrilee Challiss, Babylon Garden Merrilee Challiss, Temple NOTE : Artwork is available for sale online HERE + Read about Margaret donating her sale proceeds to Haiti on her blog HERE . January 16th, Day #2: I got to do some putting around Providence with Merrilee before I dropped her at the airport before my screening later that evening. Deb Dormody recommended we swing by Wolf E. Myrow. If you are curious about a magic place filled with amazing things read more about it here . Later on in the evening I had my screening at Craftland, 2 sold out shows of 40! Goccoed tickets by Heather Toupin Craftland January 17th, Day #3: Said goodbye to Providence and drove through 4 states (this blows my mind since I live in the Midwest) in 2 hours to get to Portland, ME. I drove straight to Eli Phant (one of the event sponsors) to check out their store. If you get a chance go there the owners Sally &amp; Peter have curated an amazing shop that has all sorts of perfect handmade goodness. I can't tell you what I bought or it will ruin someone baby shower surprise.... I got a chance to finally see Ferdinand in person, have some amazing tea, eat an incredible dinner then we all zipped over to Space Gallery for the screening. 150 people came out for the event. It was awesome. Space Gallery Right after the screening I drove off into the night as to wake up at my friends house in Belfast Maine.... January 18, Day #4: I have a group of friends who have decided to make Belfast their home . I was there for the wedding ceremony last year and my second time back was just as amazing, just much chillier. One of the best parts of touring with my movie is I get to stay in touch with old friends, this is the perfect example. So breakfast was had then I headed over to Waterfall Arts for my Sunday matinee. Belfast, ME Feather, the three legged cat Skunk Man Waterfall Arts is this rad space with studios and a gallery. I was excited that 50 people came out on a gray Sunday afternoon to watch Handmade Nation . I drove for three hours after the screening since I was due in Boston the next day and there was supposed to be a big ol' snow storm. There was. January 19th, Day #5: I woke up to this: Lucky for me I was only an hour away from Boston. I was extra super excited because I was on my way to meet up with the lovely Meighan O'Toole who does the art blog My Love For You . Meighan and I had never met, but we have had many online discussions so both of us were really excited. She was sponsoring the Boston Screening that was happening at 4th Wall Gallery that night. Needless to say Meighan &amp; I hit it off super hard, so hard in fact I didn't take one single picture of her since we didn't stop talking the entire time. 60+ peeps came out to 4th Wall for the Boston screening that night, it was awesome. 4th Wall Gallery January 20th, Day #6 So tired from hanging out for a week straight, I had lunch with my uncle Hal &amp; flew home to Milwaukee. Thanks everyone who came out last week. It's much appreciated. Mucho much. The end. {More photos from the trip are here } First off, remember when Cortney Heimerl (co-author of Handmade Nation the book) was preggers last year and couldn't finish the last few dates of the book tour? Well, check out Abraham Edward at his glorious 7 months and how flipping cute he is. I'm a huge fan. Second, I am very much looking forward to my trip this week to Providence , Portland ME, Belfast ME and Boston for screenings ((details listed on the sidebar to the right)). I am super EXTRA excited for these reasons: #1. I curated a very exciting show at Craftland Shop with two amazing women, Merrilee Challiss &amp; Margaret Oomen AND I get to be there for the opening AND Merrilee will be there from Birmingham, AL where she lives and runs the bangin' spot Bottletree . I haven't seen Merrliee since she had a show at my gallery a few years ago and it is going to be FUN. So, if you know anyone in Providence, tell them to come to the show on Thursday, all the information is HERE . #2. I get to hang out with Deb Dormody who is one of the coordinators at Craftland, and also the talent behind IF'N Books + Marks . Her dude Alec is also a treat to get to see. Actually Providence is full of magic, it's one of my favorite places in the United States. I'm so hyped for the screening on Friday there. #3. I am hanging out in Portland Maine for the first time ever. #4. I get to go to Belfast to see my friends new baby Olai and do a screening at the same time. Last time I was in Belfast I went to this amazing wedding. #5. On Monday in Boston I FINALLY get to hang out with Meighan O' Toole from My Love For You , who organized the event there. That will be a treat. I'll do my best to update you from the road....Then it will almost be February. Holy crap. Back to work. Everything is a little backed up around here, I took some for reals time off the past two weeks. Had an epic dinner party at my house, took a trip to NY and ate a whole lot of amazing food. Yesterday &amp; today just sifting through emails and seeing where I left off. I'm feeling really good about this trip East coming up, so many good people to visit in Boston MA, Providence RI and the state of Maine. I am crossing my fingers that the weather agrees with my travel plans and will update you all with new projects soon.
