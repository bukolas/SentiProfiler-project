First of all, the IPL is made for India. It won't work as well anywhere else. India has a billion people who are absolutely cricket-mad. The owners of the franchises are Indian and wealthy, the sponsors mainly are Indian, there are lots of Indian players and it's an Indian TV channel that has put its money in. I don't think any other country could do it so well even if it tried. The authorities in England were talking about it a year ago but they can't do it so well. The main thing about the IPL is that it is fun, it is pure entertainment, and it's Bollywood - or Hollywood, call it what you want. The great thing is that the catchment area for these franchises is so huge that nobody else can compete with that. It will always be better in India.
