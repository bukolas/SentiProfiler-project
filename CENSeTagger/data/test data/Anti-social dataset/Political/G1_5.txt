dear sir ,
national socialism stands for eugenics, progress and a true world order, until subjects like yourself begin to understand the basis for national socialism, we unfortunately pollute our finite world, which as a result will lead to moral degredation, unfit breeding stock and compassion for the weak. As one person i can only comment on the topic, but as with everything natural time can change ideas and people. we must embrace the national socialist ideas if we are to move forward in our journey with mankind. You must look beyond the stereotypical picture that people have painted you and begin to think less selfishly. Truth does hurt some people. long live national socialism NSDAP HHT 8820, yours truly,
