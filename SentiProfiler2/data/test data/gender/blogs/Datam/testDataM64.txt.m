When I think of the four months after that incident, I feel they were the happiest times in the factory for us. Paarthi became too silent, though he never openly acknowledged what happened that day. He still bossed around people but never came anywhere close to us. I left Johnny at my house and asked father to feed him in the afternoon. Every evening, after work, all six of us would walk to my house. We would play with Johnny for about an hour and then the other kids would walk back home. There were increasingly frequent occasions when the supervisor would leave the factory in the middle of the day and not return for a long time. We would all gather and start chatting idly about various things. The topics varied everyday – sometimes it would be about the latest movies, sometimes about movie stars, sometimes about people in the town, sometimes about our future, sometimes about the fantasies that we think of while working. That day Maari was narrating his dreams. “I want to own a car and drive it through our town, honking loud so that every body comes out to watch the procession. Maybe I would also hit the supervisor with it.” “I would want to buy a large house, like with swimming pool and everything.” Naesappan continued the dream. “And what? Fill it up with half-naked girls?” Mani asked. He usually did not like such talks. “Maybe I will do that too.” Naesappan replied though he did not seem sure of why anyone would want to fill up a swimming pool with naked girls. “Don't start your lecture now about how dreaming is bad.” Maari said with some apparent irritation. “Dreaming is one of the few things we've got here.” Sorna added. “Yes. It is the only thing we've got here. But know that your dreams would never happen. Or we'll end up being more disappointed than we are now.” Mani said.  “Why so? Why can't our dreams happen? We are not going to be in the factory all our lives.” I said.  “Maybe not. But we'd only end up in some other place doing something equally ordinary. Have you ever seen people from our village own cars or houses with swimming pools. Come on. Be practical.”  We all became silent. We all were asking the same question of why such dreams could not happen. It was difficult to digest the fact that we could end up doing such menial work all our lives. Though all of us sensed it, we wanted to still go on believing in the dreams we had. Maari changed the topic before the knot in our throats choked us.
