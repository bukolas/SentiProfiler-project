In addition to orienting myself once I arrive into any city, I usually take a walk at night. Be it in search of food, or just to feel out the city by night – how women flow and if their dispositions suggest otherwise when they walk around. How many stares are received and if there are sinister undertones to them. If locals don’t think twice before veering into near pitch-black alleys and down dark tunnels…Sorted through 350+ photos on a train to Vienna with most of them taken around dusk or at night – my main photography task for Budapest.
