After completing the tie I undertook the task of making 2 toddler ties for my sister-in-law Tiara's wedding. I took apart a Men's Tie and was able to make 2 toddler ties. I think I could even make one bitty baby tie with the left over. Anyway, I took apart one of Davis' ties to use as a pattern. It was really easy. I may make a pattern.
