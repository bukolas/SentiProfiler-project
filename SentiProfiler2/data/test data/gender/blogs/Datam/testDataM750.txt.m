I have been trying to find the full text of Toyota's apology for the safety problem that has finally resulted in a massive recall of their vehicles for repair of their accelerators.&nbsp; Sadly, I fear the full text&nbsp; consists of this: “I offer my apologies for the worries,“ [Akio Toyoda] said. “Many customers are wondering whether their cars are OK.“&nbsp; This is shockingly inadequate, as so may apologies these days are.&nbsp; This lays the problem entirely on&nbsp; the consumer -- consumer worries and wondering whether their cars are OK, not on Toyota's manufacturing defective cars and its failure to respond immediately to the problem once it was brought to their attention. This is like the ubiquitous, "If I have offended you by [my saying that you are a fat cow], I am sorry."&nbsp; This sort of aplogy does not apologize for calling the person a fat cow but for offending him or her, which is entirely different and is consistent with the idea that the listener's being offended is his or her problem, not the speaker's problem.&nbsp; Mr. Toyoda could have said, "I am sorry that we made defective cars and put your lives in jeopardy," but he didn't.&nbsp; What is worse, we have here a classic example of "too little; too late."&nbsp; State Farm reported the problem to the NHTSA in 2007.&nbsp; Even more disturbing is the fact that NHTSA was getting complaints about acceleration problems in Toyotas in 2003. I have to believe Toyota was the first to know about it but chose to put its head in the sand.&nbsp; The recall is going to cost $900 million by one estimate.&nbsp; And they are losing something like $1.55 million per week in sales.&nbsp; No wonder putting their heads in the sand seemed attractive. I own a 12-13 year old Toyota pick up that has served me well.&nbsp; And my wife has a Rav4.&nbsp; She is a little concerned that she will have accelerator problems.&nbsp; Her fears are due entirely to the fact that Toyota has been totally unforthcoming about exactly what cars, made when are vulnerable to the problem. My wife and I just finished watching Alan Alda's PBS thing on the "human spark."&nbsp; He's a smart guy and funny but what was he thinking when he endorsed the notion that there is a "human spark?"&nbsp; And what were these Harvard and Oxford and other scientists thinking? I have had some experience with media sorts and they are very fond of "hooks" that one can use to snag an audience and keep it.&nbsp; The hook this time is the notion of a "human spark" -- something we have but that chimps and no other species (on this planet) have.&nbsp; This is a terrible metaphor.&nbsp; We know that it takes a spark to ignite gasoline fumes in an automobile cylinder and that this is the most proximate cause of the piston's moving downward thereby assisting the engine in its effort to ...&nbsp; I don't want to get into automobile stuff.&nbsp; I would be way out of my depth.&nbsp; However, I am inclined to think that the evolution of those human qualities that distinguish us from chimps and other life forms might be just a bit more complicated than this metaphor makes it out to be. The terrible thing about this metaphor is that it works better for "sophisticated" intelligent design people than for Darwinists.&nbsp; If intelligent design people are willing to concede that we and the chimps have a common origin, they need only then say, "Aha, Alda is with us.&nbsp; We are the life forms god sparked into humanhood by causing us to be capable of forming complex intentions, recognizing complex intentions in others, and imagining future actions."&nbsp; Unsophisticated intelligent design people need only say that God dropped us on the planet pre-sparked. The show actually admitted that chimps are capable of forming intentions and recognizing intentions in others (but not as well as we do).&nbsp; About the future, they don't seem to think too much but to suppose they can't think about the immediate future is absurd.&nbsp; Indeed the show proved otherwise as when it was argued that alpha males may choose to share with females based on attempting to curry favor with them.&nbsp; Back in the day when I followed research on chimp linguistic development, I formed the view that the researchers who did this work were not always the sharpest academic tacks.&nbsp; In my view, they tended to be so empathetic with their research subjects that they were willing to think things that just might not be true. In the show, the human spark seemed to be whatever "sparked" the conjoint abilities to "read other's minds and travel in time," as Alda put it.&nbsp; Let me show you a picture they showed of the areas of the brain that light up when these two abilities are activated.&nbsp; Notice that these two parts of the brain are not adjacent.&nbsp; Two questions arise in my mind: how did a single spark ignite abilities requiring two different parts of the brain to be be realized and how is it that so much of one part of the brain manage to be recruited for this realization. Perhaps I am being a bit too simplistic here but I am not at all sure that these two abilities are so different.&nbsp; If a crucial feature of humans, one shared by chimps, is our socialization then thinking about the future -- making plans for the future -- must crucially have involved making plans in connection with others.&nbsp; And making plans in connection with others would seem to require an ability to form views as to others' intentions.&nbsp; A Harvard professor did note that both abilities involve escaping one's present point of view.&nbsp; I can imagine that being able to escape one's present point of view could have been a precursor to the gradual evolving of these abilities over a very long time. Spoiler Alert -- Do not read if you haven't seen but plan to see Avatar. I was directed by a tweet to an story in the Japan Times on line saying that a small but vocal minority of people believe that Avatar is racist. First, the phrase "small but vocal" wants to be looked at. What it may mean is that there are two or three people who are extremely talkative who believe this. This article begins Near the end of the hit film "Avatar," the villain snarls at the hero, Both men are white — although the hero is inhabiting a blue-skinned, 2.75-meter-tall, long-tailed alien. "How does it feel to betray your own race?" This is funny. &nbsp;The avatar is no longer an avatar whose brain is being controlled by a white man lying in a device that facilitates this control, but is instead a Na’vi man if someone in a manufactured Na’vi body whose human brain has been transferred into this body can be said to be a Na’vi person. The&nbsp;insulter&nbsp;should have said, "How does it feel to betray your former race?" One idiot promoting this thesis says "The ethnic Na'vi," he writes, "need the White man to save them because, as a less developed race, they lack the intelligence and fortitude to overcome their adversaries by themselves." This is so inaccurate I have to believe the author did not see the movie or is incapable of seeing what is in front of his face. The Na'vi defeated the white devils thanks to Jake's knowledge of the white devil's military hardware and tactics and the intelligence and fortitude of the Na'vi and the assistance of other inhabitants of Pandora.&nbsp;Far from lacking fortitude, the Na'vi threw themselves into battle without regard for their personal safety. Jake's&nbsp;growing understanding of the Pandoran ecosystem played a critical role as well in that he (quite literally) plugged into the ecosystem seeking it to intercede on behalf of the planet. Had he not become an authentic Na'vi in spirit, that intercession would not have worked. James Cameron set himself up for this criticism by using a white actor to play Jake and a person of color to play the Na'vi princess he fell in love with. Had he simply used an African American or English speaking African our critics would be in a hell of a position. It would no longer be a white man saving the blue-colored people but a person of color saving a person of a different color, but it would still be a human rescuing the people of Avatar. So, at the worst, Cameron's mistake was he cast a White man in the role of Jake. &nbsp;Casting a white man made economic sense, I suppose, but it isn't just white people who save others in movies. &nbsp;Will Smith saved the planet in one movie and I understand that Denzel Washington saves the planet in a new&nbsp;movie&nbsp;I haven't yet seen. I am so tired of people playing the "race card" I want to vomit all over this blog. I got into the civil rights movement back in 1960 when it was a serious business because African Americans were denied most basic human rights in the South, including Texas and Oklahoma, as well as other places. The change over these 50 years has been stunning. And guess what? A lot of white people worked alongside African Americans to make the civil rights revolution happen. The lesson from that time is that when there is injustice everyone is obligated to do his or her part. That is the lesson of Pandora. The three white people who controlled the Avatars as spies all "got religion" and did what they could to help the Na'vi defeat the occupying army. &nbsp;It is a good thing when people of any color assist people of any color. &nbsp;The Haitian relief effort is a prime case. &nbsp;Is that relief effort racist because white people are helping persons of color? When I first saw a TV advertisement for the myTouch telephone, I thought instantly of the iTouch, which as I understand it, is an iPhone without the phone app (I have never held either in my hands and have only seen the former in anyone else's.)&nbsp; And having spent a few years working occasionally on the linguistic side of&nbsp; trademark law, I wondered if Apple did not have a case for trademark infringement.&nbsp; One of the tests is that the new mark evoke the notion that the product it identifies might have the same origin as the product identified by the earlier mark.&nbsp;If surveys were to demonstrate that a significant proportion of consumers share my perception, Apple would be a major step forward toward proving its case. A case for infringement would have to consider the similarity of the marks. They are, of course, very similar. We have in the case of “iTouch,” a lower case “i” followed by the word “Touch,” and in the case of “myTouch,” we have a lower case “my” followed by the same word. The letter “i” when capitalized and only when capitalized refers to the person speaking or writing something. Here, though, it is not capitalized. In the case of “my” we have a word that refers to the speaker/writer of something or, in the case, of “myTouch,” the owner/user. One thing is clear, the “i” of “iMac” or“iPod” or “iTunes” or or “iPhone” is normally not intepreted as referring to the owner/user. In fact, when the iMac was first introduced, Steve Jobs claimed (see the title link) The iMac comes from the marriage of the excitement of the internet with the simplicity of Macintosh. He went on to say that it was designed with the fact that the primary use people wanted a personal computer for was to get onto the internet. Jobs cited a set of "i"-words that he wanted to associate with the iMac, namely "internet, individual, instruct, inform, inspire." Therefore, the voice of he creator provides compelling evidence that there is no semantic connection between the “i” of “iTouch” and the “my” of “myTouch.”&nbsp; When he associates the iMac with these other "i"-words, he severs the relationship between "i" and the owner/user more completely even though one of these words is "individual."&nbsp; Note&nbsp; that this word is not equivalent in meaning to "personal."&nbsp; In fact, the iMac was and is used in environments in which many individuals use a particular machine. The fact that the lower case prefix”i” is attached to a wide range of products distributed by Apple argues for it having only the meaning “a product distributed by Apple.” Originally, this “i” primarily referred to the internet though Jobs added some other associations. But the iPod breaks this connection. Apple crated iTunes in the hope that people would buy music using iTunes and then downloading it onto their iPods. That would involve internet connectivity. However, one could use an iPod without ever connecting it to a a program that connected to the internet by simply ripping one's own or a friend's music and converting it to a format the iPod could read and downloading it directly. It is clear that there is a significant morphological similarity between “iTouch” and “myTouch” for they share a morpheme. However, the first has a prefix that refers to the internet primarily but also to other things or just signifies that the product is made by Apple, and the other has a prefix that refers to the owner/user. In addition to the morphological similarity between "iTouch" and "myTouch," thre is an enormous overlap in product function.&nbsp; In fact the only substantive difference is that the iTouch cannot be used to make calls. So, Apple would find it difficult to keep HTC and T-Moble from using the mark “myTouch.” Nevertheless, as I said, I suspect a survey of consumers aware of the&nbsp; iTouch, confronted with this new product,&nbsp; would connect “myTouch” to “iTouch” and thereby to Apple. At the very least, HTC would seem to be ripping off some of Apple's market good will. I am not a trademark lawyer but I think that is a 'no no.” This evening, I caught the tail end of a Zale's commercial exclaiming,, "The more you spend the more you save."&nbsp; Contrast that with, "A penny saved is a penny earned."&nbsp; Neither actually makes any sense except for the fact that if you do save a penny on day 1, then on day 2, it is as if you earned a penny on day 1 though of course you didn't.&nbsp; The Zale's ad is even stupider, which is troubling for it presumes (as is true for many people I fear) that people will be so seduced by the combination of the gratifying concept of spending -- don't we all love to spend? -- and the comforting concept of saving to rush to Zale's&nbsp; to buy diamonds.&nbsp; However, trust me, if you go by Ben Franklin's adage on day 1 you will have more money on day 2 than if you abide by Zale's. At the Zale's web site linked to the title of this blog, you get a bit different version of this promotional scheme, namely "the more you buy the more you save."&nbsp; Notice that these two claims are linguistically different.&nbsp; We spend money to buy things.&nbsp; However, what the web site offers is savings in proportion to how much you spend, not how many things you buy.&nbsp; According to Zale's, if you spend $250-$449, you save $25 dollars.&nbsp; Clearly the smart shopper would spend just $250 and get thereby a 10% reduction.&nbsp; If he or she were to spend $449. he or she would get a tiny bit more than 5%.&nbsp; If he or she spends $500 to $999, he or she wold get $50 back, which offers the same percentage reduction/savings. Offers scale upward from the lowest level of spending upward to a maximum of $1,000 if you spend $5,000 or more.&nbsp; Notice that spending $5,000 gets you a savings of 25%.&nbsp; Wow, what a deal!&nbsp; The problem is that if you stayed out of Zale's and did not spend $250 there on day 1, you would still have $250 on day 2, but if you spend that $250, you would be down $225.&nbsp; So, spending money at Zale's doesn't save you money unless you are determined to spend $250 and don't go to a store that gives you a better break.&nbsp; In short, while a penny saved may not be a penny earned, a penny spent is definitely neither a penny earned nor a penny saved. I am lucky.&nbsp; My wife has never demanded or even hinted she wanted diamonds or any other kind of pricey jewelry.&nbsp; I think I did once buy some pearl stud earrings in a fit of romantic fervor,&nbsp; but that would have been a long time ago.&nbsp; I suggest to men that they flee from any woman who really, really wants jewelry, other than, say, an engagement ring.&nbsp; My wife and I got married with no engagement ring and no wedding rings, but when we went to Scotland for a couple of months the next Summer, we had a craft jeweler make us matching wedding rings.&nbsp; I suppose that made us leg
l.&nbsp; It sure made my mother-in-law happier.&nbsp; It is possible to spend money on other, probably more sensible things. An Israeli linguist seems to think she has turned the linguistic world upside down with her new meaning for the word "most."&nbsp; A UPN article states Professor Mira Ariel of Tel Aviv University says her research "is quite shocking for the linguistics world" and proves some of her fellow linguists are wrong in their definition of the word "most." She claims that we linguists believe that "most" generally means 51 percent to 99 percent of a group of people or objects. but that in a survey she and her colleagues did, a number of persons understood "most" to mean about 80 percent to 95 percent of a group and not the much larger range of 51 percent to 99 percent. One very serious problem with her claims is that no self-respecting linguist would ever say that "most" means 51 percent to 99 percent of a group or means '80 percent to 95 percent of a group.'&nbsp; This is just now how we use the word "mean." Professor Ariel seems not to understand the distinction between "meaning" and "use".&nbsp; It very well may be that people use "most" in a proposition like "Most Ps are Q" in circumstances in which 80-95% of the relevant Ps have the property Q.&nbsp; But that is not what it means .&nbsp; That is how we use it.&nbsp; I am not sure how to characterize what it means but I am sure that that is not what it means. If I say, that most Ps are Q and it turns out that 97% of the Ps are Q is what I said false?&nbsp; Surely not. And if it turns out that 75% of the Ps are Q, is what I said false"?&nbsp; Again, surely not.&nbsp; This may not be how people generally use "most" but the meaning of "most," whatever it is, is consistent with these two claims being true and so long as that is true, then we can be sure that Professor Ariel is wrong about what "most" means. After Obama was inaugurated, he made himself excessively visible.&nbsp; Anyone in show business knows that you always leave them wanting more.&nbsp; The problem is that Obama kept himself front and center, shoiwing up on TV virtually every day.&nbsp; Before we had time to want to see him again, there he was announcing this or that new appointment, putting forth this or that new policy, or giving an interview.&nbsp; As a result, Obama fatigue has set in and that has left him very vulnerable to the lies being told by the health industry about his and the Democratic Congressional health care bill, Fox News, and whoever else feels animus toward him, including especially those who harbor ill-feeling toward African Americans. Naturally, the Antis will say they are pure of thought and that their objections to Obama are based on his actions as well as his apparent inaction.&nbsp; The Rasmussen Report s don't bear them out. Seventy-four percent (74%) of African-Americans Strongly Approve along with just 19% of white voters (see other recent demographic highlights from the tracking poll). Among all voters, just 34% now give the President good or excellent marks on his handling of the economy while 47% say he is doing a poor job in that arena. On national security issues, 42% say good or excellent while 41% say poor. Sixty-three percent (63%) of voters believe that political correctness kept the military from preventing the Fort Hood shootings .&nbsp; So, what we see is a striking division between Blacks and Whites as to how he is doing, which is a bit of a give away that racial attitudes are coloring perceptions.&nbsp; That sort of thing didn't keep him from being elected but given the continued high unemployment and many other issues, he is guarnteed not to have a second term.&nbsp; As James Carville famously said, "It's the economy, stupid." The last of these three items is especially interesting.&nbsp; It is clear that the military knew that Major Hasan was a Muslim and that he was disgruntled.&nbsp; Naturally in a country Bush poisoned with his constant drumbeat of "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", etc, and given the disposition of people to posit conspiracies wherever they see something they don't understand, right-wingers and various and sundry other nutcases are sure this was part of a terrorist plot. Conspiracy theories are the refuge of those who have agendas or are laboring in ignorance.&nbsp; I recall the theories graduate students had about admissions policies in my university department.&nbsp; Early on we used&nbsp; a Master's exam to help determine who would be admitted to the Doctoral progrm.&nbsp;&nbsp; A minority would not be admitted and the theory emerged that we had a quota, never mind that limiting the number of students we admitted actually hurt the department economically. I first encountered the theory that Major Hasan's actions were the result of a terrorist plot on the Dennis Miller show and that political correctness, the bane of right wing, was in full flower in this case.&nbsp; I was rather surprised.&nbsp; Naturally, the military is reluctant to jump to the view that Hasan was acting out of an anti-American or anti-military political stance.&nbsp; That would be beyond stupid, bordering on being imbecilic. Not so, the right wing in America tells us.&nbsp; At Right Pundits we find Why are we able to so easily label Malik Nadal Hasan a terrorist? The fact speaks for itself. He is just as much a domestic terrorist as Timothy McVeigh was labeled so for his heinous act in Oklahoma City. And while McVeigh perpetuated his act from afar in silence, Malik Nadal Hasan shouted anti-American political views at his victims as he mowed them down with automatic weapons. &nbsp;The first thing I learned about Major Hasan is that he really, really, really didn't want to go to Iraq.&nbsp; The military is not disposed to worry overmuch about where soldiers do and do not want to be posted, but they probably should in some cases.&nbsp; This would have been one. The title of this article is "Malik Nadal Hasan: Muslim Terrorist Challenges Obama’s Timidity."&nbsp; I suppose this could be more misleading but I don't know how.&nbsp; I seriously doubt that Obama told the military how it should go about its investigation or how it should present the facts to the public.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Obama is vulnerable to any attack on anything American by any Muslim.&nbsp; Its a right wing freebie. Obama neeeds to do the following by next year at this time. 1. Get the health care bill in place. 2.&nbsp; Somehow get unemployment to turn around.&nbsp; I can think of some ways -- how about using unemployment benefits as subsidies to businesses who hire the uneployed for a year, say. 3.&nbsp; Get the hell out of Iraq. 4.&nbsp; Render Al Queda and the Talliban totally impotent. If he does 1 and 2, it is possible that he will get a second term.&nbsp; If he does 1-3, he will get one.&nbsp; If he gets all four he will be elected President for Life. Many years ago (1967 or so), I bought a wonderful Yamaha 250 cc motorcycle, the manual for which had this instruction for shifting gears: Tachometer tells the moment to do. Unfortunately, the RPMs given for gear shiftng kept this very fast motorcycle operating a little slower than a motor scooter. One evening, I told a friend who had ridden behind the original owner that the instructions couldn't be right and he offered to ride behind me and tell me when to shift. He did not look at the tachometer. He used his ears. I suppose the manual could have said. Ears tell the moment to do. Once I got the pitch right, I was golden. I suspect that some junior executive at Yahama persuaded his bosses that his English was excellent and he could ably translate the manual. On balance he didn't do badly. Today, I happend across a web site while hunting for information as to what might be down the line for Blackberry phones given the buzz surrounding the iPhone and the new Androd phones. I came across this paragraph. The Blackberry mobile phones are looking professionals and stylish mobile phone with can peoples are attract to this phone. Blackberry is the smart phones which is the most popular in the world with its charming features. It offers accessibility to an extensive variety of applications many wireless instruments across the world. It provides accessibility to an extensive variety of applications on several wireless instruments across the globe. by data and other services. This piece of prose shocked me even more than that Yamaha manual. This articale comes from Weblineindia, a link to which is associated with the blog title. That's what's shocking. If I have prejudices in regard to India, they are (1) Indians are very smart and very well-educated; (2) Many if not most Indians know English either natively or fluently; and (3) India has a bunch of great cuisines. I clicked on the link and the first paragraph that popped up was this one: Now a day ecommerce is a very popular among the internet users, so what is Ecommerce? People are habituated to sell and purchase their products or any types of items on the internet, its called ecommerce, and to online sell products you need ecommerce web... So, it only gets worse. It is possible that these articles were written in some regional Indian language and run through some bad translating program. More likely, we are dealing with people who have big brains (see prejudice 1 above) but smal English language centers (see apparently false prejudice 2). These articles are represented as "free content for your website or blog," which further confirms the axiom that you get what you pay for. I know that what I am writing is rather snobish, possibly even mean-spirited, for I would seem to be making fun of people who are, after all, doing their best. To that, I say, "bullshit." If I planned to publish something in German or Spanish I sure as hell wouldn't translate it myself. Surely, if you are actually trying to inform people, to say nothing of sell things to them, you will want to do better than this: The Blackberry Solution is used to access mobile email and personal information. Also other of the self applications are also used. But the development Blackberr software for the solution of Blackberry. Also Blackberry application, for assistance if issues arise. This reads as if they are offering some sort of spyware ("access personal information"). If that isn't true, then they are very engaging in linguistic self-abuse.
