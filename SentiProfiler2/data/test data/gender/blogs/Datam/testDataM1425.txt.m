The Universe already loves you. Love it back by loving yourself and accepting yourself for who you are. 
May be the 'love it back' is interpreted by the *&^%#@ THEY' in their own way.!!
If we are we always and not harm others....thats life i supose. Corectaa?
I suffered a lot in my life bcos of those "%&*(& THEY" and so i stopped worrying about them long time back. Sometimes i think what so far i have earned by having a concern for those "naalu peru" ?
Its bcos of your individuality and courage i admire you always.
