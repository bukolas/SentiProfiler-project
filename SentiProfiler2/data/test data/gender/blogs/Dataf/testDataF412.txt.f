If you’ve previously been on regular trips to places and have recently found that those places are losing their charm or losing whatever it was that made them “unique” for you, then perhaps it is high-time for you to considering taking time out to visit somewhere new? Set a course for a place – either near or far – that you’ve always wanted to visit, but have never found the reason. You’ve found your reason now, so throw caution to the wind and just DO it! After all, you only live once, so you should probably try everything at least once as well.
