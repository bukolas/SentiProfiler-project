I know Nivi as a little sister, young play mate and now, good friend.. We are cousins with whom I can have a serious discussion as well as girly talks.. I love her.. Since she has become a night owl lately, I am getting to talk to her all through my day and nights.. From when I have seen her, she has not changed much - I was not allowed to pick her up when she was young (even I was too young then..) and now, cannot do it for you all know the obvious reasons ;)
