It was difficult because every company has cut their budget. I tried
many job search engines, but there is no internship available. Then, I
tried to use some old fashion way, mailing resume out, to companies
which I am interest. My respond is only 1 out of 20, and the only
respond was I made a following up call. It was not cost efficiency,
soon after few more attempts I drop this idea. After all, I decided
that it wasn't that bad to rely on connection to get a job. I went to
the student career center and asked the person to help. I read a
statement somewhere, and it said 90% of your first impression of
someone probably is right in the end. My guessing is correct, that
person was not capable of her job, because she can't even answer me
the result of a survey she asked those just grad student to do few
months ago.
