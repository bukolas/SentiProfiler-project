The two-calendar-day reporting time expires and the Rules Committee can take up the bill. Traditionally, a rule takes one calendar day to ripen but past leaders both Republican and Democrat have gotten around that by including in the rule a provision that essentially declares that same day a whole new day (yes, this is White Rabbit time they'd be observing). If Speaker Pelosi chooses to she can bring up the vote Thursday, but again, she'll need time to whip members so a vote on Friday or Saturday is more likely.
