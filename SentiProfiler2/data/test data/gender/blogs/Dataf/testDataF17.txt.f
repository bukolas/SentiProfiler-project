Music - The fact that we have something called music to appreciate is utterly amazing…I consider it one of the ingenious things we discovered(mind you..not invented).The right music just lightens up your day! It still amazes me as to how we react emotionally to different frequency of sounds…how do we do that ? hmmm..I am no scientist so won’t delve any deeper :)  I know that the genre of music is a touchy subject for some…for example: i am not a fan (at all) of heavy metal…I detest it..but doesn’t mean i wont allow anyone else to decide for themselves.  Personally i have no particular genre to call ‘my kind of music’,it all depends on my mood…when i am up for it..I enjoy mostly romantic and soulful music..but i also enjoy R&B,Bollywood and Pop a lot too..Of late..soft rock and punk rock have caught my eye(Green day :) )  Anyway that’s a lot about me…just one question…how many of you out there listen to a particular song a million times till you are fed up? (that is my exact story..yeah i am quite boring! :p)  Coming to favorites I have way too many…so many that they can’t even be called favorites anymore.. :) Music can REALLY heal..it’s just a matter of listening to the right songs  so go pick up your i-pod,phone,laptop(or any other instrument that plays music) and get happy!
