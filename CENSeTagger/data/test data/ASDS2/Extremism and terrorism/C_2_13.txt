Notice how now that HAMAS is kissing the west's butt, they are not being called "militants" or "terrorists" anymore. I will tell you this much from my view. HAMAS is corrupt, but I will not pass judgment on soldiers of Kitaeb al-Qassam because many of them are sincere, and it is the leadership and police (or as we say in AmeriKKKa "the man") who are corrupt. For those who want to read HAMAS literature, listen to HAMAS nasheeds, watch HAMAS videos, etc. that were from when Sheikh Ahmed Yassin (r.a.) was alive, then I still do, but this is by no means a Fatwa. After the Sheikh's martyrdom, HAMAS sold out. I love and respect Sheikh Ahmed Yassin (r.a.), but I believe that it is Jund Ansar Allah and Jaish al-Ummah who are continuing his dream and keeping his legacy alive, not HAMAS.
