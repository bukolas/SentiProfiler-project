Thank you for the great comments everyone has been leaving lately. &nbsp;There have been some questions about my materials I use to draw or software to animate. &nbsp;So, I'd like to answer some of them. &nbsp;I animate in Flash for 2D and Maya for 3D, with the exception of the occasional animation in After Effects or Nuke. &nbsp;I almost always draw quick, people, observational sketches with a pen. I have a nice Faber Castell 'S' PITT pen. &nbsp;If I'm drawing from my imagination, then I almost always use a medium-hard pencil &nbsp;H's or F's. &nbsp;If I like the drawing, I will sometimes refine it with a soft 4-6B pencil. &nbsp;If I add color, I usually scan in my drawing, set the drawing layer (in Photoshop or Illustrator) to 'multiply' blend mode and add color on layers below that. This is an illustration I made for an insurance company a few years ago. &nbsp;I was going through some old files and stumbled on it. It seems to give the sense of busy, which is what I am right now. &nbsp;It's an animated gif that I created in photoshop. &nbsp;Basically you feed 5 or 6 versions of a drawing into photoshop and it loops them. Last year while on vacation at one of the lakes in northern Indiana, there was this young girl who would catch frogs every night with a flashlight and a bucket. Not only could she catch them, but she could also stun them by rubbing their bellies. A couple of weekends ago, I rode down to Venice Beach to draw.&nbsp; I found a nice spot to sit and watch the graffiti guys working on the Art Wall . The History Channel has some new programs we've been enjoying at home.&nbsp; Here are a couple of characters from 'Pawn Stars' and 'Pickers' After a long Christmas break, the quest continues, as I try to dust the cobwebs off. Here are some people that held still long enough for me to draw them. The highlight of the day was the guy wearing heels and carrying his wife's purse. I attended the CTN-X animation expo this weekend. With all of the great panel discussions going on, it was a perfect time to draw and watch the hand gestures of the different speakers. it seems most people have similar hand/arm movements, but the subtle differences in the tension in the fingers reveal the unique personalities. They didn't broadcast the Colts game here on the west coast, so I was stuck watching a couple of teams that I didn't have much interest in. So I started drawing...
