Wasn't sure whether we'd have a good experience after all the things I'd read in reviews about Enterprise, but we got to the small regional airport late in the day on a Thursday afternoon.  The compact we had reserved was gone and so we were upgraded to a Nissan Murano, a nice SUV (horrible gas mileage, though).The manager (only one person doing all the tasks) didn't write down a large scratch on the left rear bumper, and I made my husband go back in and have her identify it on her copy.
