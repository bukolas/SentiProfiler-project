I'm so tired of myself... 
I'm so tired of being in love... 
I'm so tired of wanting to be in love... 
I'm so tired of always being alone... 
I'm so tired of not having someone to talk to... 
I'm so tired of not having someone to show how much I love them... 
I'm so tired of not having someone show how much they love me... 
I'm so tired that I donâ€™t have someone to hold onto... 
I'm so tired that I have no one to lie to 
and tell them I'm cold just so I could cuddle with them... 
I'm so tired of having no one to kiss over and over again...
