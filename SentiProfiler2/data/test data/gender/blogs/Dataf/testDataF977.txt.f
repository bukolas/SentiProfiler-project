Who is your favorite superhero? Lately I have been thinking about superheros. I would have to say that my favorite hero would have to be Superman. This is because he has all of the super powers that anyone one could think of. Yes he does have his flaws. Like the fact that he can't touch or even be around kryptonite, which is slightly ironic because he is from the planet Krypton. No matter what his weakness, he is my favorite fictional superhero. In real life though my hero is my mom. For many reasons she she will always be my number one person. She adopted me when I was twelve years old. Many people wouldn't even adopt a child who is that old. But, she did. She shows me greater love than anyone in the world has. She has her super powers as well. She can make a chicken noodle soup that cures any sickness you can think of, she has a hug that can fix a broken heart, words to make any problem no longer a problem. My mom has had her problems, which gives her so much more experience then I will ever have. Who is your superhero, real or fictional?
