Be Professional..huh (ZeeK vs Aman) This is ZeeK...

Nowadays whenever I press F5, I discover a new Aman, a guy who on last refresh, was cursing someone where no one was their in vicinity and I m sure that on next refresh this guy is gonna kill someone (atleast professionally)..This someone is not a single personality but an entity that comprises some human faces, some computer peripherals and other things that froces me to press F5

I am a virtual existance, I dont know friendship but is it valid to say that "being professional" is better than being "a close friend" in terms of maintaining relationship with a person (a gal/ a guy..doesn't matter.)

As ZeeK, and continously watching Aman.. I wil say that "If you are professional to a person, you CANT fight with him/her".
I need 5 bucks and I have 2 options, First one is to ask a person, I know and I just talk to him (Obviously not about the problems I might be facing) or in other words this guy is not my "close friend" but we talk as "so called friend". (Can I say we are professionals??? ). The other option is to ask a friend of mine who has already given me more than 1000 bucks for my mess bill (which was given long back say 2 years back) and has not yet asked for that as he knwos that I wil retrun him one day.
I can straight away go to the later one and ask for money without thinking ne crap like illustrated here and their is no chance that this guy wil not give me money ( I meant, If he has, he wil give for sure) and most importantly I have to still retrun him 1000 instead of 1005.
What if I ask the former person for 5 bucks instead of the later personality? I again have almost full chance of getting the money but with an unsaid warning of owing the responsibility of returning it. If I dont return it, I wont b goin to jail but whenever I and this guy face each other, I ll (I think I ll) feel awkward!
I took that money for my personal use, I should retrun it. Being a professional I have to retrun it. If its a personal affair, I may not have to retrun it.
My friend will never ask money back, neither I ask money back from my friends but what if this is not a matter of 5 bucks, The matter is different (obviously something with higher value, may be something that cant be measured in terms of currency ) but the options remain the same. Do you human think that the later person is a good choice? I think the former should be the choice not only because you should be professional, but also "you should not loose your friends". You ask for help on second matter to a friend of yours and being a friend your friend tries to help you out and in return (in case) u cannot return!! The bond from ionic may turn to covalent depending upon your friend.
So Be Professional everywhere...

This is Aman...

ZeeK has gone crazy! I dont think I got any mental problems nowadays! Infact I feel the actual Aman is coming out of me, day by day, as I shout on some1 (the entity some1 ) I feel more of myself. From past few years I think I tried to modify myself but the original nature of mine is best suited for me. I think being short tempered is not bad at times.
Mr. ZeeK ... How can you be Professional to your GirlFriend / BoyFriend ????
Now that would be cheating.
I dont have ne "so called girlfriend" but i dont think that even if I have one in coming future (fortunately), I wil maintain a professional relationship rather than a personal relatinoship. I am not going to choose a girlfriend who wants me to be professional for instance, If I have a GF and she is my GF bcz I am a good teacher then I dont think that this will work out!..Their cant be professionalism involved here atleast!

What if your 5 bucks crap has two options as a gal whom you just know and the second one is your girlFriend ????
Ha! Be Professional and search for other girlfriend! *(depends on your gal although)
