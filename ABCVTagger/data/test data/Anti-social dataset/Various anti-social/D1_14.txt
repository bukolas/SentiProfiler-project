why is it that i always find myself alone? why is it that i always seem to enjoy a lot of time by myself? why is it that i struggle to get to know people? why is it that i struggle to start a conversation? why is it that i hide my emotions, and never express the way i feel to family and friends? why do i shut myself away from the rest of the world? why is it that whenever i try to socialise, for the most part, i dont enjoy myself? why is it that a lot of thigs that most people i know love doing, i just dont enjoy myself? why do i always feel so negative about myself? why do i always think that people are talking about me and saying bad things about me behind my back? why do i always doubt myself? why do i always think that no one cares about me? why do i always feel left out?

people say that nobody knows who you are, better than you know yourself!!! but the only problem with that is, that i dont even think i know myself at all!!! almost on a daily basis i ask myself all these questions, and i still haven't come up with any answers!!! why am i lke this?
