Storm of the century

I know that the "big" storm is old news, but we have been in California for two weeks visiting Jared's family (another post about that to come) and I haven't gotten a chance to tell our story. Thank goodness for all the modern technology that alerts us to the weather with enough warning to prepare. Wednesday night we made a trip to Sam's club to stock up on gas and food. It wasn't crazy crowded because this was two days before the storm is supposed to hit. My kids had been sick for about a week and Thursday night Ben was up complaining that his ear hurt. Friday morning we decide to take them to the Doctor before the storm. Snowflakes started to fall as we pulled into the parking lot. It was crowded, but they saw us and both my kids had ear infections. The doctor advised us to keep them inside for a few days. Then we had to get their prescriptions filled. Every pharmacy within a 10 mile radius had a 1-2 hour wait on prescriptions, people were panicking. We came home and Jared went out a little later to get their presciptions, are we seeing a pattern? He made it home safely. Everyone (but my youngest brother) was home and we just hunkered down for the storm. My sister and I had stocked up on some new toys that we pulled out for the occasion. Friday, all was well. We felt like we were prepared. I got up early Saturday morning, for no apparent reason, and my sister was up too. She was worried about us losing power. Having no electricity might not seem so bad considering that my parents have propane heat, but keep in mind that we are on a well here. A well with an electric pump. No power also means no running water for us. She had filled up the bathtub with water and I filled every camel back water bottle that we had (we have a lot of them between us all). Then we go back to bed. After I get up and eat breakfast, I start making bread. We didn't buy any bread because I was going to make some. Here are the pictures of the dough rising. 


I was preheating the oven to bake my bread when the power went out. It was only 10 am. According to my husband, I was freaking out. I was worried about my bread and the fate of us all without bread to eat. But I really didn't need to worry. Jared and my brother-in-law dug out the gas grill and the fire pit and cooked that bread!


I really was impressed. It snowed the entire time they were out there cooking the bread. The two loaves they cooked on the grill, and the three free form loaves they cooked in a dutch oven over a fire they built during a snow storm. The gas grill really saved us during the entire weekend. For lunch we had leftover lentil soup that they warmed up outside with fresh bread. For dinner we grilled up some venison, potatoes, and veggies. It did not feel like we were deprived of anything. But it sure gets dark early with no electricity. My brother-in-law popped popcorn on the gas grill, and we let the kids watch a show on our portable DVD player that has a 6 hour battery (which was fortunately fully charged). Jared had filled up lots of buckets of water and my sister had filled the tub, but with 12 people in the house you use a lot of water just flushing toilets. By Saturday night our bathroom water supply was almost depleted. We still had plenty of drinking water, thank goodness. My sister went outside and stuck all those empty buckets around the house to catch the water run-off, brilliant! Sunday morning, still no power. We used as many paper products as we could to avoid having too many dirty dishes laying around. Since it finally stopped snowing, the men went outside to assess the damage. Numerous trees had fallen, including three across our drive way. They spent most of Sunday cutting down the trees and shoveling a little bit. Once they got the driveway cleared they did some further exploring on our street. There are three ways to get to main roads from our house. Well, a power pole had fallen across the road one way, a tree branch had broken off, taking down some power lines with it the other direction, and the "secret back road" had a car stuck right in the middle of it. No power and no way out, we were totally cut off from the outside world. The phone stopped working on Sunday. Cell phones with no electricity to charge them were our only link to the outside world. I have a couple of siblings that live an hour away, and they didn't lose power. They offered to rescue us, but they couldn't get to us, we would have had to hike about a half mile in 30 inches of snow. My two kids have ear infections, my parents are in their 70's, not much hope of hiking out. Remember that the doctor had told us to keep our kids inside for a few days. That was a bit harder than I thought it was going to be. My brother grilled chicken and potatoes with some veggies for lunch. Sunday night before the kids went to bed we all hung out together in the living room, lighted by my dad's two oil lamps. My brother played guitar and we all sang while the kids danced around. It was a lot of fun and something that only happened because we had nothing else to do. Then we put the kids to bed. We were all a little disappointed that the power was not back on for the Superbowl, for which we had made sandwiches and had chips and dip. Then my brother-in-law and my dad rigged up a TV plugged into my mom's Prius. And it worked! We got to watch the Superbowl, I couldn't believe it. But then it was back to darkness. Monday morning the kids were getting a little stir crazy. My sister dug some toys out of storage that the kids haven't seen in two years. That helped buy us some time. After lunch the road was cleared one way, we could leave! Still no power mind you, but a way out. My sister called some friends in the ward that live in an apartment complex and she asked if we could all come over and shower at the club house. All 12 of us climbed into my sister's 4 wheel drive car that seats eight. We dropped my brother and his son off and we headed off to shower. We filled up all of our water bottles too. Keep in mind that another storm was coming with another predicted 10-20 inches. We went to a grocery store to get us through another storm. Then we went to the mall. It was almost surreal. We had felt so cut off for nearly three days and people were shopping at the mall like it was an ordinary day. I really felt like we had just come out of the dark ages. Which in a sense we had, I guess. Then we made it home, but we had to hike up the long and steep driveway with all our groceries. When we got home, the power was back on. I was so happy, I could go to the bathroom without a flashlight. My parents have a very unique house and all the bathrooms are in the center of the house without any windows. In other words, very dark even in the middle of the day. We hit the house with a vengeance, we did 3 loads of dishes that night alone and 4 loads of laundry. Can I just say that Jared is a survivor, I really don't need to worry with him around. My brother-in-law is the same way. They really saved the day. The story doesn't end there. With another storm looming in the horizon, everyone's plans changed. Two of my siblings (that live an hour away) decided to head to Florida. Their school district had already cancelled school for the whole week. One of them need my brother-in-law to house sit, so he was leaving. We were leaving for California on Wednesday. My dad said that if all his shovelers were leaving he had better go too! Tuesday morning they headed to the airport to see if they could get on a flight to Florida. At 9:40 am my mom calls from the airport. "Honey, the airport is closing after one today, do you want to try and get out to CA today?" Yes, I think I would. She handed her cell phone over to the Southwest agent. He was super friendly. His name was Eric and this is what he said to me "I can get you and your family on a flight leaving here at 11:40 am, can you make it here by then?" I paused for just a minute before I responded. I still had laundry, important laundry, drying. "Yes, we will be there." Then my mom talked to my sister "he says you and the kids can fly standby to Florida, to you want to come, the flight leaves at 10:50 am?" She said "yes" too. The whirlwind began. Bags packing, kids getting dressed, everyone hiking down the drive way. We booked it to the airport, as fast as you can book it in that much snow. My brother-in-law did a great job of driving us safely there. We literally ran through the airport with bags and kids in tow. I am not much for spur of the moment traveling, but it was an adrenaline high. Because the airport was closing in two hours, there weren't many lines, and they all let us go to the front of them. Very nice! We are helping my sister make it to her gate, my parents already on the plane. My sister is carrying one bag, Jared is carrying a bag and a kid. I am trying to herd the rest of them to the gate as fast as 4 and 5 year olds can run. She makes it to the gate and there is no one there. My parents are on the plane, sitting on the front row, saving her seats. The flight attendant prepares to close the door, my mom says "my daughter is coming!" The flight attendant tries to tell her that she didn't make it. My sister flagged an attendant and they tell her to just run onto the plane. I guess once they close the doors, they don't open them again. She made it! Then we had a few minutes before our flight took off. We barely had enough time to buy some lunch before we had to board the plane. But the kids were real troopers and we made it. They were so well behaved. It was awesome, traveling with kids does get easier. It took me awhile to come down off that high, but it was kind of fun. My brother was pretty surprised when he came home tuesday night to an empty house full of food. He had to hike the 1/2 mile because his ride couldn't make it down the road. That is our amazing story of survival. I hope you all were well during the storm of the century!

MDAC
My older brothers, who are nine and ten years older then me, often babysat for me and my siblings. They invented many "interesting" games to keep us busy until my parents came home. The most popular one was called mattress diving association championship or MDAC for short. It involved a mini trampoline, numerous mattresses stacked on top of each other, music, and diving on the mattresses. We would run, jump on the trampoline, and dive on to the mattresses. It was fun. You would have to really know my brothers to understand how they could make that game so much fun. We all had nicknames, our signature jumps, and turns holding the title of MDAC. My brothers would also videotape the proceedings so that we could watch it afterward. The proceedings included interviews, statistics, jumps, and sometimes award ceremonies. Well, this past Saturday it was snowing again, all day long. Jared and I picked the wettest year to move back east. Imagine five children, eight adults inside all day long. So after dinner I decided it was time for MDAC the next generation. I figured it would let the kids burn off some energy. It worked. The kids loved it, but it wasn't quite the same without my brother commentating the whole thing. CJ cried when we cleaned up the mattresses, it was hit. My sister even did a few dives! Enjoy the video, although you would probably enjoy seeing the original footage of MDAC. Fortunately I don't own any of these videos and it is unlikely that any of my brothers would post it.
