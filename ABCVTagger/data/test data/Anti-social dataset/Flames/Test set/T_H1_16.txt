I must disclose to you, before you continue reading, it is possible to become addicted to feedback supplied by me. Proceed with extreme caution, a box of kleenex, and a condom on. First of all, you broke rule #1... It is unethical, illegal, and chicken shit to alter, add, delete or expand on previously posted comments! Second of all, your theory is wrong. I hardly think the things I said were "cute". I can only agree that I am a "smart-ass bitch". But you'll have that. Thirdly, don't be scared! I can take it, tough stuff. Although you would probably like a response to your comments posted regarding my letter... as you know, you are currently in violation of rule #1... so try again SAILOR BOY! P.S. It is not my fault you were not allowed to listen to Kenny Rogers. There's still hope, Smart Ass Bitch.
