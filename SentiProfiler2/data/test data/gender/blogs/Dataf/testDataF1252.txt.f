CSI has provided us with bad debt collections since January of 2005.
   We are very pleased with the results that CSI has given us. Our accounts are transferred to them electronically, and we receive monthly payments and reports from them.
   We have never had a patient complaint about about their treatment from CSI. The only complaints we have found are usually pertaining to billing insurance/co-pay issues. They understand healthcare receivables and we have a most satisfactory relationship with them.
I would highly recommend CSI to any healthcare organization.
