About three things I was absolutely positive.
First, Stephenie Meyer was going to be in Tempe, AZ at an address I knew.
Second, there was a dress there that I wanted...and it wasn't going to be cheap.
And third, I was intently and tenaciously going to fight for it I woke up so excited to be in the vicinity of Stephenie Meyer that day. I call her OZ. Not because she is small behind a curtain but because she is the gatekeeper of the wonderful land of Twilight. She created it, she got it published, and she made more of it for us. Thank you Stephenie for being our greatest mentor. A strong, talented, mother and wife, who has crazy boy dreams just like us!

I set off that day determined to get the lunch. If you guys remember I blogged about lunch and ‘Forever Dawn’ being exactly what I was throwing my money at. Somehow it changed along the way.

The auction started and the dress somehow became the focus after the lunch went nuts. And when I say nuts...watch this video to see. Lunch to me was something that could not be duplicated. Well, she could have lunch everyday with someone but to pick her brain on anything Twilight you could think of would be priceless. Kudos to Carol for getting it!

I decided at one point that there could be more 'Forever Dawn' Epilogues printed out. Making the one item that could not be duplicated the Eclipse prom dress. There will never be another worn by Stephenie, for an event she created around her book coming out. To me this became the item I had to have.

Now me being competitive might have something to do with it. Two ladies came running up to the front of the room. This was two rows, directly in front of me. I looked at Jason (my husband) and gave him a smirk...maybe with a little bit of snark which he took as a let's get em' look. Everything that day had gone into the thousands of dollars.
Eclipse Manuscript $1300.00
Host Skateboard $1100.00
Lunches $6500.00 X 2
Forever Dawn epilogue $5100.00
I knew the dress was going to be insane with all the hype. I sat next to a reporter who kept asking me, "how much you think this will go for". It was fun as we predicted the numbers.

The two ladies were Laura from Twilight Lexicon and Kara from Twilight Moms. So here they are, two rows ahead, bickering back and forth on the figures $5,000 to $5,300. J.S. Lewis says, "you have a sparkle Twilight Mom shirt--you have money". I started dying laughing. It was funny! He was good at egging them on. Finally Jason says loudly, "$5,300" and the ladies start to scramble. They actually tried to pull their money together or help each other somehow. I thought okay here is big dog twilight site and another big dog twilight site ganging up on me, the little Twilight site. I looked at Jason and said, "Get it". Jason yelled out "$5,500". Kara and Laura were a little stunned and I think they knew we didn't look like we were giving up anytime soon and conceded.

I could hardly contain my excitement! I ran up to them and said, "Twifans.com will take good care of the dress ladies" and almost sprinted to meet Stephenie Meyer for the first time that day.
People often ask why Charlotte Martin hasn't got a boyfriend. She's an attractive 31-year-old from Hungerford in Berkshire with a successful career as a three-day  event rider and a busy social diary. "When they ask me why I'm single, I never know how to respond," she says. "It's more acceptable in London. Here in the country people wonder what's wrong with you. But I'd rather be on my own than with someone who isn't quite right. My friends say that I'll meet someone when I least expect it and I guess I just have to believe them. Horsey girls aren't that bad really."

It shouldn't be difficult to meet a like-minded person in the countryside, given that there is a structured calendar of rural social events, including races and point-to-points. But according to Patricia Warren, a farmer's wife from Derbyshire who runs the Country Bureau, a rural introduction agency, the country dating scene can be bleak, whatever age you are. "Communities are small and people work long hours," she says. "There are amazing men out there who want a wife and children but feel as if they've been sitting on a tractor for the last 10 years and haven't met anyone."  Charlotte, however, is socially proactive. "I'm not a hermit, I go out all the time. I like having a full itinerary," she says. "I've gone to so many hunt balls this year, I've become a bit of a joke among my friends. But it's rare to be introduced to a new face and even if I am, the likelihood is that they'll know my friends." For many rural communities, the hunt ball is an annual highlight, organised ostensibly to raise money for the local hunt, but presenting locals with a rare opportunity to dress up and swing each other around on the dance floor. "I'd never go to one on my own," Charlotte says, "but as long as I have a wingman, I'm fine."

This is exactly the right approach, according to dating expert Mary Balfour. "Find a dating buddy; someone who is in the same situation as you," she says. "Single friends will also give you moral support if you're feeling depressed about meeting the third frog in a row."  If you've been brought up in a country community, the chances are you will already know a lot of the people living locally. According to Patricia Warren, this can make socialising stale. "You need fresh blood," she says. Two of Charlotte's friends organised a singles party on Valentine's Day and 70 people turned up. "It was very refreshing to be sat next to two people I didn't know," Charlotte says. "But that kind of event doesn't happen every month; it takes a lot of effort to arrange."

Determined to improve the chances of fresh encounters in the countryside, Lucy Reeves, 30, from Northamptonshire, founded rural matchmaking website Muddy Matches with her sister Emma in 2007. "I grew up in the countryside before moving to London and overseas. When I moved back to the country it occurred to me how hard it is to meet people. As soon as everyone starts to couple up and have children, meeting new people gets harder," she says.
This flat iron is great! I've had mine for 3.5 years now and it hasn't disappointed me yet. I've tried other ceramic irons (CHI, Solia, HerStyler) and they are all quite heavy and start to weigh down on your wrists after straightening for a while. I love that the Sedu is so light and straightens my hair so smoothly and easily! I've recommended this iron to all my friends who want to buy flat irons and they all love theirs too! I have used this Sedu ionic hair straightener for 3 months, my hair has been changed from frizzy to shiny & smooth now. I wanna sincerely thank this hair straightener and I will highly recommend it to my friends, cuz it's really a good tool to renew the hair. I have used many of my friends straighteners after i bought this one. Some straighten faster, but none of them keep my hair as silky as the one i own. My hair feels much less burned using this straightener than using others. It also has a wide range of temperatures. Overall it is a great straightener, but it does take longer than other ones. I have very curly hair so it would take long no matter what. I recommend this straightener, especially to people that don't want their hair damaged easily.
Everyone, it seems, has an opinion on autism: celebs, politicians — not to mention the medical community.

But to grasp on a gut level the emotional texture of what it's like to live with Asperger's syndrome (the highest-functioning form of autism) or to love a family member who has it, you need to read Jodi Picoult's powerful new House Rules.

House Rules has a serviceable plot involving a murder trial. Set in Vermont, the novel centers on Emma Hunt and her two teen sons. Older son Jacob, 18, is a high school senior with Asperger's; the younger son is the unimpaired Theo, 15. (People with Asperger's are often highly intelligent and very verbal but have difficulty navigating the world because they cannot interpret social cues correctly.)

Where's Dad? Although he sends his monthly child support, he fled to Silicon Valley when Theo was 6 months old, overwhelmed by the chaos created by a special-needs child.

Everything revolves around Jacob. Picoult brings alive how "Aspies" crave order and fall apart when confronted with change. Jacob's rigid schedule, his clothes, his food become minefields if threatened.

Emma has devoted herself to helping Jacob through endless therapies, supplements, special diets, doctors. She also ceaselessly advocates for accommodations in school for Jacob. He's doing better, but he'll never be self-sufficient. Hers is a heroic but exhausting and isolated life filled with fear about Jacob once she's gone — as well as guilt over Theo. With good reason, he resents how his whole life is dominated by his older brother's disability.

Emma's deepest grief is Jacob's loneliness. To help him, she hires a lovely grad student named Jess to tutor Jacob in how to read social cues. And to learn why he shouldn't drone on about his favorite topic, a CSI-like TV show. Jacob has a Talmudic knowledge of blood splatters, forensics, crime scenes and decomposing bodies.
I really enjoyed listening to David Martosko! It was nice to feel like we actually had someone who was in our corner. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0bbuuSGcdI      I just returned from the Western United Dairymen convention in Modesto. (I will blog about that later)

Upon returning as I was going through my many emails my son had sent this to me. It was created by the AG communication students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where my son is in his 4th year studying dairy science.

This video exemplifies the quality of students, facility and staff.  This video reward our sacrifice of putting you children through college, knowing that they are surrounded by the quality of the hands on experience. “Learn by Doing”.

To all of you THANK YOU! This is awesome. You make us proud and give us hopes of a bright future.


He put it all out there on the table to explain what we are up against. (I have provided the links below)  Martosko says the Humane Society of the United States masquerades as a protector of pets while plotting the demise of the dairy industry. He said the society is attacking milk producers as part of its effort to turn Americans into vegans. “They are not promoting kinder treatment of farm animals,” said Martosko, director of research for the Center for Consumer Freedom in Washington , D.C. “They are promoting the abolition of farm animals.” Martosko said many people believe that the society mainly funds dog and cat shelters when in fact it spends most of its hefty income on lobbying, salaries and political donations. He told the dairy farmers that Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive officer of the Humane Society of the United States , is “the biggest enemy you have.”

www.consumerfreedom.comwhen it finally warms up enough to BE out there...to listen, smell, savor the arrival of spring with all it brings. Ducks shuttle by unseen, but clearly heard, and geese are back on the river. No woodcock though.

No peent.

No wingy whistle turning the empty night into a whirl of wonderful music.

Then yesterday morning, just as I stepped onto the back porch in the still dark, not morning yet except by government time change standards , I heard him.....close too. I wonder if he moved his peenting grounds or if it was just so quiet that he sounded closer than other years.

He usually starts his sky dance up by the horse pasture pond. This year it sounds as if he is right down under the apple trees by the garden. He showed up on the 15th last year and the 27th in 08
March 29th in 07 but not until April in 06

Another waited for event had taken place as well. When I got to the barn in reindeer bathrobe, barn coat. and high rubber boots, Armada had finally had her first calf, another amazing red surprise, but, alas a bull. She was feeling sorry for herself and wouldn't even try to stand up so I came back to the house to get the boss to give her a bottle of calcium, which perked her right up. I CAN give bottles if I have to, but she was lying half under another heifer and I thought that someone bigger, stronger and with longer arms was called for. Both baby and mama are fine btw...

I am so grateful she finally got around to having him. She was due the 13th. We started doing barn checks a couple times a night about a week before she was due to calve....which adds up to a lot of 0-dark-thirty walks to the barn...in the mud...which is actually drying up just a tad.

Although E. E. Cummings found mud to to be a source of inspiration and delight, I personally find it to require me to sweep the kitchen floor about fifteen times a day in a cycle of endless futility, unquenched by ceaseless boot scraping..the outdoors just wants to come indoors during mud season.

**The photos above are an update of things at the pond in Lykers...still pretty frosty and not much around but a few chickadees. Just a few weeks and that will change.
After being disappointed by Jodi Picoult's previous book, "Handle With Care," I dug into her newest effort hoping for the best.

While "House Rules" treads some familiar ground when it comes to plot devices, her examination of a family dealing with the form of autism called Asperger's syndrome will touch all but the coldest heart.

Picoult quickly introduces us to the three members of the Hunt family: Emma and her sons, Jacob and Theo. At 18, Jacob's intelligence paired with his Asperger's makes life in the Hunt home difficult. For the Hunts, autism rules their life. Meals are color-coded (only green food on Monday, red on Tuesday and so on), and TV watching revolves around a crime-solving show.

Emma long ago gave up dating, friends or any remnants of a social life. The boys' father bailed years ago, although he does appear late in the book.


The book's title defines the problems, as well, for Theo, who is 15. He must abide by the house rules that make life run smoothly for Jacob. Making things go well for Jacob, however, comes at great cost to Theo. His much-delayed trip to the DMV for his learner's permit is still on hold; classmates heckle him over his special needs brother; he's endured injuries when the sound of crumpling paper or a change in Jacob's routine upsets him to the point of becoming violent. (Here is where the plot borrows heavily from "My Sister's Keeper," where a younger sibling is held hostage to the needs of her older sister.)

This time, though, Picoult puts Jacob at peril via a murder of an attractive young graduate student, Jess, who has been working as his tutor. At first, her boyfriend draws the attention of police, but quickly enough the focus swings to Jacob.

And no wonder, because he has taken to showing up at crime scenes around town and fills dozens of notebooks with the plot and details of every episode of "CrimeBusters." He even stages murder crime scenes at home, which Emma has willingly gone along with — until he's arrested for Jess' murder.
It's been about a year since the original RIM BlackBerry Bold made its debut, and while it remains a very solid device, it's about time that a flashier, faster model took over the reigns. And that device would be the RIM BlackBerry Bold 9700. Not only is it T-Mobile's first 3G BlackBerry, but its sleeker design and performance enhancements make it a valuable addition to the carrier's lineup. The Bold also offers UMA support for Wi-Fi calls, a faster processor, and an updated OS. The only major downside of the smartphone, and one that plagues all BlackBerry devices, unfortunately, is the Web browser. It simply doesn't stand up to the competition in terms of ease of use or functionality. That said, if you're after a powerful messaging smartphone, the RIM BlackBerry Bold 9700 certainly has our vote of confidence. It offers more speed and features than T-Mobile's other BlackBerry offerings and gets the upper hand on the T-Mobile Dash 3G with its UMA support. As of press time, T-Mobile did not reveal a specific release date but said the Bold 9700 would be available in time for the holidays for $199.99 with a two-year contract.

Design
The RIM BlackBerry Bold 9700 looks nothing like its predecessor. Gone is the wide, masculine body, and in its place is a more svelte, compact smartphone that should fulfill RIM's hope of attracting both men and women, and consumers and professionals. At 4.29 inches tall by 2.36 inches wide by 0.56 inch thick and 4.3 ounces, the Bold 9700 is certainly more pocketable and is even smaller and lighter than the BlackBerry Tour. It feels solid in the hand and features a similar leatherette backing as the original Bold to give it a classy touch. In addition, the chrome edges and lines between the keyboard rows add to the handset's appeal.   Given the smaller size, you do lose a little bit in screen real estate. The Bold 9700 has a 2.44-inch display (compared with 2.75 inches) but its 480x360-pixel resolution at 245 pixels per inch certainly keeps things clear and sharp. It's the same as the Tour's, and while we did miss having the larger screen when viewing Web pages and videos, overall we had no complaints. Text was easy to read, and images looked crisp with vibrant colors.
This should be a victory lap for Islands. After all, their uniformly excellent debut resuscitated Paul Simon's Graceland as an indie pop touchstone back when Vampire Weekend were still playing in the quad. And with that album's bouncy calypso rhythms and hip-hop bursts, Jaime Thompson and Nick Thorburn (previously known by their noms de rock J'aime Tambeur and Nick Diamonds), succeeded in laying to rest the ghost of their beloved former group, the Unicorns. Since then, they have honed their breezy, buoyant sound on the road, and, despite Thompson's departure from the lineup, the Montreal-based sextet seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough, as demonstrated by moving from tiny indie label Equator to Anti-, home of such classy "career" acts as Nick Cave and Billy Bragg. But Arm's Way, which does away with the musical levity and genre experimentations of Return to the Sea, is much darker and more conventional than its predecessor, and not, unfortunately, to its benefit.

Islands' new obsession with darkness does, however, make sense. The throughline between all of Thorburn's records (with Islands and the Unicorns) is a lyrical obsession with death in all of its forms-- from the corporal (bones) to the metaphysical (ghosts)-- so it was only a matter of time until his band tried to match its outward sound to the inner themes. Gone are the guest rappers, the acoustic nuevo-country twang, and the sunny Afro-Caribbean flourishes (though there are still a few brief flashes of them, as on chugging rocker "J'aime Vous Voire Quitter", which, two minutes in, implodes into a Bahamian "La Bamba" breakdown). In their place are theatrical string arrangements, layers of silvery, minor-key guitars, and lots of gothy synthesizers.

To be fair, almost any record would suffer by comparison to their breathless first one. These songs may be less immediately catchy, but all of them have a moment in which they break away from their straightforward guitar-rock underpinning and allow strange, spacious moments to burble up from within. On "Creeper", the most memorable sing-along here, it's when the stomping 80s guitar melody briefly gives way to off-kilter bursts of steel drum. On "Abominable Snow", a song which predates Return to the Sea, it's a winsome vocal interlude that's nestled before the final crashing chorus-- a breathy call-and-response waltz that's laid against elegant violin embellishments and delicate guitar pulses.
while many teachers do not think about their high school days whilst teaching their students. I find myself constantly looking back at that 2 years of my life and wonder just what did I do? How did I feel at that time? Did the same thing happen to me? What are those students thinking? Can I get a clue from what I went through? I always end up feeling that somehow, i missed some experiences I should have had.

I look into their earnest faces, their artlessness, their simpleness and I wonder if I still had that intact when I was their age. I doubt it. I’m not saying they are angels. but their calculations, strategies are so transparent I always want to ask them who they are trying to fool. Except that it is just too amusing.

I’ve always felt that that 2 years of my life was pretty much wasted. beside the fact that I made a few friends I would keep for life, joined the drama club and made precious memories of becoming someone I just wasn’t, and breaking out of my shell while in character… i was always too self conscious to really enjoy school. too… negative… too… non-chalent… too cynical… too fatalistic. I never valued the activities there were. Even now, I probably think sports day was lame, national day with a march pass was lame… boys were lame…

I always felt that entering NUS was a kind of liberation from jc.

Upon reflection, i think some of the factors that acted as barriers were
1) the fear that I would not enter university after screwing my ‘O’s and entering CJC. I have to say that i had never (and probably will never) study as hard and memorise as many facts as I did for my ‘A’s. I studied and forgot about the experience
2) lack of confidence. i assumed i was invisible and thus became invisible
3) the idea that many of the things we had to do was lame (besides watching plays and studying literature)
4) the idea that many things didn’t matter in the larger scheme of life. I forgot how experiences could and will shape a person
5) the lack of interest in almost everything
6) the lack of many familiar faces around me

i look at my students and find myself wishing i could go back to the time when I was 17. the time when I didn’t know better, the age of wide-eyed innocence.

Alas, the best we can do is to live in the present and live to the fullest to avoid making the same mistake. Carpe Diem.
The trend took off two years ago, when the Hankyu department store opened in Osaka, Japan, with its entire 16,000 square meters of floor space devoted to masculine products from shoes to cigars. Soon after, Louis Vuitton opened its first men-only store inside Hankyu, replete with leather furniture, pure wool carpet, and a goatskin rug. Around the same time, the British fashion queen Vivienne Westwood, who can spot a forward-looking trend seasons away, also opened her first store geared for men in Tokyo.

Now others are catching on. On Feb. 9, Hermès will open its first men-only store on Madison Avenue in New York. Housed in a classic brownstone, the 817-square-meter interior will resemble a cross between a traditional tailor's shop and a gentlemen's club, reimagined with a contemporary vibe. The fourth floor, designed to evoke the feel of a private home, will be devoted to made-to-measure wear, including bespoke suits as well as special-order items like luggage. Meanwhile, a few blocks uptown, Ralph Lauren has announced plans to convert its landmark Rhinelander mansion into a shop for men only, a move that underscores the importance of the menswear market to the company.

For all the talk of women's rising spending power, luxury brands seem to be courting the fashion-savvy male these days. "Luxury fashion brands that have catered primarily to women see the menswear market as a growth opportunity in a low-growth market," says Milton Pedraza, CEO of the New York–based research firm the Luxury Institute. "They have had some male offerings for some time and feel they can gain market share from weak competitors, primarily top Italian brands that cater to men only and whose tired and outdated brands currently attract primarily older men due to lack of great marketing and 'cool' factor."

In some cases the move to men-only stores follows a steady rise in menswear sales. Louis Vuitton, which recently opened a men-only boutique inside Harrods, has seen "very strong growth" in its menswear business, says Jean-Baptiste Debains, president of Louis Vuitton Asia Pacific. "We want bigger and more differentiated places for men…and I believe it is a trend that will spread." The luxury giant's interest in creating different shopping atmospheres for men and women extends to existing equal-opportunity stores, which have made subtle changes to color and lighting schemes in the men's departments. "We know that men don't necessarily have the same expectation and don't behave in the same way in stores," says Debains.
Now's as good a time as any to get started. Diverse, delicious and not as difficult to cook as you might think, Indian is among the leading cuisines of the world. With every state, city and even every home having its own recipes for thousands of dishes, you can imagine how the variety is absolutely mind-boggling!

Contrary to popular belief, Indian food is not just about curry, chillies and oil! There is probably no other cuisine in the world that includes as many healthy and diverse vegetables and spices. At the same time, Indian cuisine is not just for vegetarians. If the worldwide popularity of Butter Chicken, Rogan Josh, Vindaloo and Fish Amritsari is anything to go by, Indians know a thing or two about pleasing the non-vegetarian palate!

In India, cooking is considered an art and mothers usually begin to teach their daughters and pass down family recipes by show-and-tell, fairly young in life. As a matter of fact, food is very serious business. In most Indian homes, even in this day and age when most women work outside the home, if one is not cooking or eating a meal, one is planning what to cook next! Meals almost always include several dishes, dessert and a staple or two like rice and Chapatis.

Over the course of history, various invaders have passed through India and left their stamp behind on its cuisine. There was Aryan, Persian, Arab, British and Portuguese to name just a few. The result is foods that are so delicious, some of them are legendary!

Join me as we explore the delicious depths of Indian cuisine! Here are some resources to help you get started.
"I have to admit, when I first saw Handy Manny, I thought looked like a cross between Bob the Builder and Dora the Explorer. Handy Manny is a Playhouse Disney animated preschooler program about the title character Manny, a bilingual handy man, and his tool box full of talking tools including the humorously named Pat the Hammer, Turner the slotted screw driver and Squeeze the Pliers. The tools have various personalities that sometimes leads to problems in the toolbox, but they are soon sorted out as the tools learn various lessons about problem solving, teamwork, friendship and community.

There are various other characters in the town who appear regularly throughout the show as well, such as Kelly who owns the Hardware Store and Mr Lopart in the Candy Store next door who always tries to fix things himself, usually with disastrous consequences.

The “Tooling Around” DVD has five episodes of approximately eleven minutes each: Squeeze’s Day Off, Amigo Grande, A Sticky Fix, Pat The Screwdriver and Supremoguy. Manny and the tools attend to tasks from fixing broken trophies and steps to putting up a new flagpole and helping to build a new house … and they even learn the value in having a rest and not working sometimes.

The show is not overloaded with singing, but has a couple of songs repeated in each episode such as “Hop Up Jump In” when the tools hop into the box on the way to a job, and “We Work Together” while they are making .

Handy Manny incorporates some basic Spanish, and sure, Spanish is not as culturally relevant here in Australia as it is in America, but like any kind of bilingual program, it’s helpful for kids to learn how language works.

The adults in our house find Handy Manny a nice little show without the annoying shouting, irritating constant repetition, and sometimes just plain old weirdness of some preschooler viewing. Manny’s gentle accent is very easy to listen to, and every time I see Mr Lopart’s cat with a comb over I giggle. If I judge preschooler television by my ability to be in the same room as the television while it is on, without actually wanting to throw something at the television, then Manny is a winner.

The kids really enjoy watching Manny (even the ‘big’ school boy), and will grab the toy tool kit to play and sing along as they watch. And I can hope that they are absorbing some of the team work and problem solving lessons as they watch.

I love the convenience of DVDs for trips, or for when there’s nothing appropriate on television at the time, and Tooling Around is already on the favourites list in our house."
Guys. I am off to Paris in an hour to launch 'Les Nuits aux Etoiles," which is the French translation of an early novel, 'Starry Nights'. The book is being published by France's most prestigious imprint, Actes Sud. And the event is being hosted by Yves Carcelle, who is the President of the LVMH Group. I am fortunate to have two such powerful brands for my French debut!!

All set for the soiree . And all set to answer questions on the luscious Carla Bruni ....plus, anything else the press throws at me. Wish me luck!!

This appeared in the Asian AgeDeccan Chronicle :

Ji haan.What Soniaji wants, Soniaji gets! God is also great, ji! He likes Sonia. What a bhet! That too one day after International Women’s Day. Am I thrilled to bits?? Nope. I have never been pro-reservations. And that cuts across the board. I don’t believe in subsidies and quotas. But my far worthier sisters say, I am being silly about this. Super sensitive and even selfish. Theek hai. I guess we should be rejoicing, and eventually I too may get co-opted. But till such time, I’m keeping the bubbly on hold. My biggest and main concern is that the bill does not remain a naam ke vaastey grand gesture, in the same tradition as our Jai jawan! Jai kisaan! programmes, which sounded terrific as slogans and won elections for the then leaders…. but left those poor jawaans and kisaans exactly where they were…where they still are.

I am in distant Dubai, attending the Emirates Writers’ Festival,and it seems slightly surrealistic to be talking about the women of India being on a collective high, especially to the ladies here, who look away uncomfortably and change the subject when the topic of womens’ rights comes up. A lovely woman who has written her first book based on a true story of a thirteen year old local girl who’d been married off to a much ,much older, much ,much married man, lowers her voice to confess, “ We have to be careful what we say… and who we say it to. I would have preferred to write a stronger book, but I also knew it wouldn’t get published.” A poet seated at the same table, nods his head sympathetically, but says nothing. His own poems on exile are filled with yearning for a different life. But even poets know when to hold their tongue.
Major Pettigrew dimly knows this woman as Mrs. Ali. She has been blending tea specially for him at the local convenience store. Since these two are not strangers, they cannot be experiencing love at first sight, even if discreet sparks fly between them. It’s the reader who is apt to be susceptible: read this one page, and you may find you’ve fallen head over heels for Ms. Simonson’s funny, barbed, delightfully winsome storytelling. Don’t say you weren’t warned.

That “Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand” opens at a moment of heartbreak has no sobering effect whatsoever. Grief is what it took to make the rigidly correct Major notice Mrs. Ali, or anything else around him. This 68-year-old widower, a man who has taken some of his greatest satisfaction in reading and rereading his will and is proud to grow a type of clematis vine that his neighbors think is worth stealing, has long been immune to human companionship. He has preferred a style of such extreme correctness and gimlet-eyed detachment that all it takes to give this book its comic perspective is to present his point of view.

Set in the kind of tidy, bigoted backwater where Mrs. Ali is understood to be either Indian or Pakistani even though she has never been further abroad than the Isle of Wight, “Major Pettigrew’s Last Stand” sounds British to the bone. It isn’t: Ms. Simonson was born in East Sussex but has spent two decades in the United States, a stint that has only heightened her ability to make jokes about American excesses as they are registered by Major Pettigrew. The book has a couple of broadly vulgar American characters, and they turn up in the Major’s village in what he regards as disturbingly rapid succession. For him “two Americans in as many weeks,” Ms. Simonson writes, was something “approaching a nasty epidemic.”

As the story hums along, it contrasts change for the better with change for the worse. In the first category there is the Major’s extremely correct yet warm friendship with Mrs. Ali, who is 10 years his junior, is also conveniently widowed and shares many of the Major’s tastes, including a love of reading. He is duly impressed to find her carrying plastic-covered library books. He’s even happier when he learns that she shares his love of Kipling. In the second category is Roger, the Major’s hilariously obnoxious son, a striver who lives in London and once suggested that the Major get rid of books to make room for an enormous television, so that he “would have something to do in the evenings.”
According to the 2009 Internet Auto Award from AutoScout24, Europe’s favourite car is the Opel Insignia. We perhaps would have placed our bets on the Opel Astra, but clearly a sedan is still more popular than a hatchback.

The trophy is known as the ‘Carolina’ and was accepted by the company at an awards ceremony in Munich. Carl-Peter Forster, chairman of the Supervisory Board of Adam Opel GmbH, said: “This new award for the Insignia proves that our blend is right: sporty, elegant design combined with innovative technology. The new Opel philosophy also resonates with the customer.”

Opel has already sold more than 150,000 Insignia in Europe, and the Astra is also a big-selling model for the company, taking up a third of its sales volume. It begs the question as to why General Motors really wants to sell the brand, and whether the sales success with this model design will continue with new owners. Opel Insignia OPC in the pics.
In her book editor days, Janet Hill Talbert edited books like Having It All?: Black Women and Success by Veronica Chambers, Gumbo: A Celebration of African American Writing edited by Marita Golden and E. Lynn Harris and Crowns: Portraits of Black Women in Church Hats by Michael Cunningham and Craig Marberry. She also sent one of the loveliest rejection letters I have ever received ("This is exactly the type of book that I would love to publish but...)  She even followed up with a phone call! She is a jewelry designer now and she has a new inspirational line of jewelry called On This Rock, inspired, as she puts it, by her love of words and The Word from the Bible.  The jewelry is made from sterling silver, brass, beach stones and other materials.  My favorites are the cuffs, especially the ones featuring "The Lord's Prayer" and Psalm 23.  Perhaps I will wear one of them for good luck the next time I send out a book proposal.  And say a prayer... 
I can hardly believe that Josie Natori almost opened a chain of McDonald's franchises instead of becoming a designer, but it's true.  Even after becoming the first female Vice President of Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch in the 1970s,  Josie was anxious to take on an entrepreneurial venture in the tradition of her grandmother, a venerable businesswoman in her own right. 

The result is Natori, her now 32-year-old success story.  The label began with lingerie and has since expanded into fragrance, home, eyewear and ready-to-wear. I was very excited meet Josie at her home to on Manhattan's Upper East Side, thrown by yet another entrepreneurial diva, The Creatrix of Purple Lab cosmetics, Karen Robinovitz.  The occasion was to introduce her new collection, Natori Essentials.   Social Media evangelist that I am, I was thrilled to see that Josie was so enthusiastic and interested in jumping into the new media world!  While her staff maintains @NatoriCompany, Josie maintains a blog, Josie's Thoughts, and tweets herself at @JosieNatori.  She even commandeered my BlackBerry so I could show her a few new tricks on Ubertwitter!
Anyone that’s been in any branch of internet marketing such as Search, SEO, Social Media Marketing and the like will fully understand what I mean when I say that Google is always changing. The animal we seek to master is impossible to tame, if merely for the fact that the algorithm behind the Google search engine is never really still. Stable, arguably so, but the fact remains that engineer upon engineer, programmer after programmer are spending their time constantly tweaking the code and structure of Google, often leading to unexpected twists in the SEO trail.

The point that I’m getting at is that as a marketing expert, Search professional, or SEO company, one must be prepared to change with the times. Resistant to change some of us may well be, but change we must, if we are to survive. Of course, some changes are easier to accommodate for than others, some are small, some are large, the difficulty to change with the times sometimes – but not always – scales with the size of the change.

However, once in a while comes a change that is just incredibly awkward to deal with. A change that is so downright frustrating that it makes you wonder why you ever got into this business. A change like that has happened in recent days and continues to still happen. That change is typically referred to as “personalised search”, the process via which a Google search can become “personalised” or “unique” for a given user, particularly when logged in to one’s own Gmail/Google account.

It works by giving alarming priority to popular branded sites (presumably ones that Google thinks has a high amount of “trust” built up) and pushes these to the top of related search results, so you end up being more likely to find these branded sites in a better position than other, smaller, “less trusted” websites. This also has a literal knock-on effect of pushing the websites that were previously ranking well for related keywords (the smaller sites) out of the way entirely, as they’re moved to one side to make room for the “big ones”. From an SEO point of view, I’m sure you can understand the frustration here.
One day, I decided to make some cake. As I was making a small cake, I had lots of leftover batter, and decided that I would make heart shaped cupcakes. I greased the bottom of the heart-shaped cupcake pan with margarine, and poured in the batter. Turns out I didn't have as much extra batter as I thought, so the last row of four in the pan was left empty. I didn't think much of it, and put it into the oven.

After cooking for a short while, I came back to see smoke had lightly filled the room, just enough that the room seemed blurry. I opened the oven in panic to see that the cupcakes were not even close to being finished, but the margarine in the empty row has sizzled and was now being to steam and burn. I took the pan out and wiped the row as best as I could and put it back into the oven so the cupcakes could finish.

The butter continued to smoke, but it wasn't catching fire, and wasn't harming anything so I simply let it be but kept a careful eye on it.

I set off the fire alarm twice and had to bring in a fan and open the door so the thin layer of smoke wouldn't set it off again. Even a couple hours later when my mother came home, she commented on how the air seemed foggy.
A lot of wine lovers fantasize about someday becoming winemakers, but I can tell you honestly that I’m not one of them.  Although I do love to spend time walking amongst the vines, sampling wines, and trying to imagine how they might evolve down the road, there are far too many aspects of the job that would make me crazy. 

First, there’s all that cleaning.  Ask any winemaker, and he or she will tell you that much of the job -- way more than you’d think -- involves the constant hosing down or otherwise sanitizing of tanks, barrels, equipment, floors, etc.  And then there’s that whole chemistry/science aspect. 

If you really want to get a feel for the sort of work winemakers get up to on a day-to-day basis, get your hands on a copy of Vineyard & Winery Management magazine and check out Tom Payette’s “Wine Tech” column.  In his May/June column, Tom -- a Virginia-based winemaker and consultant -- details the steps for testing for and correcting pH levels in wine.  The process takes place not in a picturesque wine cellar, but a sterile laboratory setting, and requires all manner of scientific equipment and painstaking precision.  Every time I read one of Tom’s articles, I say to myself:  Man, I’m glad I’m not a winemaker.

Just thinking about all the variables that winemakers face from the vineyard to the bottle makes my head spin.  They have a multitude of options to consider in terms of clones, yeasts, winemaking equipment, cellar practices, barrels, toast levels, and on and on.  Deciding on the right combination usually involves years of experimentation -- and I just don’t have that kind of patience. 

I was reminded of this recently, while having lunch with two terrific winemakers from Duckhorn Wine Company’s Anderson-Valley-based operations: Neil Bernardi of Migration and Zach Rasmuson of Goldeneye winery.  (Migration was originally a part of Goldeneye, but it became a stand-alone brand in 2009.)  The occasion for our meeting was the launch of the first Chardonnay in Duckhorn Wine Co.’s 30-year history:  The 2008 Migration.  While we munched and tasted, Bernardi and Rasmuson talked about the process of creating this new wine. 

Duckhorn first set out to make Chardonnay in the late 1990s when the company founded Goldeneye, which was intended to be a Burgundy-style winery focusing on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.  With this in mind, they planted three small blocks of Chardonnay on the Anderson Valley estate. 

“We experimented with Chardonnay for quite a few vintages, working on winemaking technique and thinking critically about what kind of wine we wanted to make,” Bernardi recalls.  “After years of making wine from these specific blocks, we felt that the wines were very good, but a little less distinctive, and not exactly in the style we had hoped.” 

The Goldeneye team grafted its estate Chardonnay over to Pinot Noir in 2006, but kept up its search for great Chardonnay fruit in Anderson Valley.  But still, the style they were after eluded them.  “Meanwhile, Migration Pinot Noir was distinguishing itself stylistically as being bright, elegant and acid-driven,” Bernardi says, “a style that very much mirrored what we wanted to achieve with Chardonnay.” 

The company eventually took its search for the ideal fruit beyond Anderson Valley, and discovered that Russian River Valley grapes -- particularly from Dutton Ranch in Sebastopol -- fit the Migration profile.  This happened more than a decade after the company first set out to make Chardonnay -- and finding the right grapes was only the beginning. 

“Because we barrel ferment almost all of our wines, it provides an incredible opportunity to look at many variables,” Bernardi explains.  “For example, in 2008 and 2009, we looked at native vs. inoculated yeast (10 different strains), fermentation style (tank vs. barrel), malolactic fermentation (ML) vs. non-ML, various ML bacteria strains, cooperage (stainless steel vs. new wood from eight coopers vs. neutral wood), and stirring regime.” The research process took two years to complete.
CBC had a 2 pt lead with 14.2 seconds left in the game. Ryan was fouled on a defensive rebound. Double bonus for CBC. Made the first one and Oakville called a time out. Missed the second one and Oakville's Josh Noblitt came down and hit a killer 3 to tie the game and send it into overtime. He was 6/8 from 3 pt land in the game. A Columbia Tribune reported captured the final 14 seconds of the 4th quarter on video. Ouch.

CBC was cold from the field all night. 3/17 from 3 pt land. From my point of view, it seemed like they struggled to play as a team down the stretch when the pressure was on. Maybe the credit should go to Oakville for playing great defense. They had a plan and worked it to perfection--keeping the game close and hitting shots when it counted. Ryan had 15 rebounds but only 7 points. And he missed a key free throw at the end of regulation. His teammate Seth Jackson had 15 points, but was also called for at least 2 player control fouls in the second half. Scored on both attempts, but the baskets did not count. Point guard Cory McArthy only had 3 points and was 1/9 from 3 pt land (1/11 FGA/FG).

So now CBC plays for 3rd place today at 1:40. I hope the kids can pick themselves up and go out on a positive note. They had a great season and got to a point no one really thought they could get to. But there is one thing that is interesting about their team (and other teams in this era)--and this is purely my opinion. Now, you'll have to know that I was a 2-guard and small forward who prided herself on passing the ball to my team's All-American forward. I used to hold the school record for single-season assists because I had to play smart. I couldn't out-run or out-jump anyone. I wasn't a scoring machine and knew it. And I didn't have that crazy 3 pt line to play with my mind. We were a small team and had to rely on a match-up zone on defense and solid fundamental offense to score.
Liberals keep complaining that Republicans don't have a plan for reforming health care in America. I have a plan!

It's a one-page bill creating a free market in health insurance. Let's all pause here for a moment so liberals can Google the term "free market."

Nearly every problem with health care in this country -- apart from trial lawyers and out-of-date magazines in doctors' waiting rooms -- would be solved by my plan.

In the first sentence, Congress will amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act to allow interstate competition in health insurance.

We can't have a free market in health insurance until Congress eliminates the antitrust exemption protecting health insurance companies from competition. If Democrats really wanted to punish insurance companies, which they manifestly do not, they'd make insurers compete.

The very next sentence of my bill provides that the exclusive regulator of insurance companies will be the state where the company's home office is. Every insurance company in the country would incorporate in the state with the fewest government mandates, just as most corporations are based in Delaware today.

That's the only way to bypass idiotic state mandates, requiring all insurance plans offered in the state to cover, for example, the Zone Diet, sex-change operations, and whatever it is that poor Heidi Montag has done to herself this week.

President Obama says we need national health care because Natoma Canfield of Ohio had to drop her insurance when she couldn't afford the $6,700 premiums, and now she's got cancer.

Much as I admire Obama's use of terminally ill human beings as political props, let me point out here that perhaps Natoma could have afforded insurance had she not been required by Ohio's state insurance mandates to purchase a plan that covers infertility treatments and unlimited ob/gyn visits, among other things.
Touch-screen technology has become wildly popular, thanks to smart phones designed for nimble fingers. But most touch screens have a major drawback: you need to keep a close eye on the screen as you tap, to make sure that you hit the right virtual buttons. As touch screens become more popular in other contexts, such as in-car navigation and entertainment systems, this lack of sensory feedback could become a dangerous distraction. Now researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed buttons that pop out from a touch-screen surface. The design retains the dynamic display capabilities of a normal touch screen but can also produce tactile buttons for certain functions.

Graduate student Chris Harrison and computer-science professor Scott Hudson have built a handful of proof-of-concept displays with the morphing buttons. The screens are covered in semitransparent latex, which sits on top of an acrylic plate with shaped holes and an air chamber connected to a pump. When the pump is off, the screen is flat; when it's switched on, the latex forms concave or convex features around the cutouts, depending on negative or positive pressure.

To illuminate the screens and give them multitouch capabilities, the researchers use projectors, infrared light, and cameras positioned below the surface. The projectors cast images onto the screens while the cameras sense infrared light scattered by fingers at the surface.

The idea of physically dynamic interfaces isn't new, and in recent years, researchers have explored using screens made from polymers that can alter their shape when exposed to heat, light, and changes in a magnetic field. However, these materials are still experimental and relatively expensive to make.
Her radiant, larger-than-life image is everywhere: on snow-fringed billboards in Stockholm's chic shopping district, on stately buildings in the capital's picturesque Old Town, on the side of city buses. Ebba von Sydow, 25, is Sweden's current it girl: the face of Swedish fashion brand MQ's antismoking campaign and editor-in-chief of the nation's largest magazine for young women, Vecko Revyn ("Weekly Review"). "Every girl in Sweden wants to be Ebba," says a 28-year-old female office worker from Stockholm. "She is the woman with everything — success, power, brains, and beauty."

In other words, Ebba is the perfect example of what the latest research shows: that Sweden is a country in which women truly thrive. In fact, a 2005 report by the World Economic Forum found this Scandinavian nation to be the world's "most advanced country" for women, with greater levels of equality, power, health, and well-being among women than anywhere else. (The survey ranked the U.S. an abysmal 17th place — one above Costa Rica.)

Relaxing with coworkers at an exclusive spa to celebrate her 25th birthday, Ebba sips champagne while explaining that Sweden's pro-female culture has helped her achieve her dreams. "I have a fantastic life and a job I love. Women here are judged on their talents, not their gender," she says. "If you're good at what you do, you can get to the top very fast."

Sweden, which has a population of 9 million — around the same as the state of New Jersey — has a long history of female-friendly policies. The government gave women equal rights to inherit property way back in 1845; in 1901, it introduced the world's first formalized maternity-leave program. In 1958, the Swedish Lutheran church changed its doctrine to permit women to become priests. And today, female politicians make up around half of the Swedish parliament.

The goal of equality starts young: "Anti-Sexism Awareness Training" begins in kindergarten, where male toddlers are encouraged to play with dolls, and females with toy tractors. In school, classes in cooking, sewing, metalworking, and woodworking are compulsory for both sexes. All education, including college, is free, and girls routinely outperform boys; in 2005, women made up more than 60 percent of all Swedish college students. All this adds up to more flexible gender roles later: As one Swedish website puts it, "In our country, women drive the buses and men push the baby buggies."

Do you use Google Calendar? If you do, and if you share your calendar with friends, family, and colleagues to make scheduling group activities easier, you should check out the new Labs feature that launched today. It’s called “Smart Rescheduler.” Say you set up a dinner outing with your entire gang and your brother’s family. It was a lot of work finding a time when everyone could fit it in. And then, after you think it’s all set and on everyone’s calendar, your brother remembers he has tickets to a basketball game that night. Grrrr. Back to the drawing room. And naturally, it falls to you to figure out a new time. Just click the tool (after you install it; below) on the right side of your calendar and it searches everyone’s calendars for the next time that works for everyone. You can even specify the date range and times of day you want it to consider so you don’t end up eating dinner together at 2am. Pretty cool. How do you get it? Along with a lot of other experimental add-ons for Google Calendar, it is in Google Labs. As you can see from the screen shot above of the gadgets in my calendar, I also use the “Jump to date” and “World clock” gadgets. I can’t tell you how often that World Clock has saved me from embarrassing scheduling mistakes.
Happy Friday and welcome to another Essential Tools feature. This week we have programmer turned affiliate marketer Eric Nagel in the spotlight. Eric is an  Yellow Pad of Paper & a Pen – after researching, using, and rejecting many “to-do” applications, methods, etc. I’ve gone back to a yellow pad of paper & a pen. Each day, I write down what I need to get done that day, and go through my list. I have “daily” tasks (like checking stats, updating sites, etc), then there’s things I want to get done that day, and finally my big picture tasks, which may take a couple days to finish or weeks out before I start them. However, writing them down daily (I use a fresh sheet each day) allows me to reevaluate their priority in my list. When I work on a task, I try to focus on that one task – if something else comes up, I write it down, but keep working on the original task. This keeps me on track, and allows me to get a lot done in a day. (From Char – I have finally found an online app that rivals my pen & paper – TeuxDeux – worth looking at)

APIs - automation has saved me. Without automating as much as I currently do, I’d need 28 hours in a day to keep up with the various projects I’m working on. Spending 2 hours automating a 5 minute daily task will pay off in just 3 weeks! Invest in automating tedious activities, and you’ll find more time to work on new projects.

APIs are entry-ways to the data or processes that need to be done. One of my sites had 8 Google AdGroups that I was manually entering the cost data from into a spreadsheet daily. Then, I’d enter the revenue from CJ and ShareASale. Now, the same project has nearly 280 AdGroups, and the cost, revenue and profit are all automatically pulled into my database each day. Checking the profit (or loss) on each AdGroup now takes 10 seconds. In addition, as merchants are deactivated, the AdGroups are automatically paused, not only saving me time, but also money.

Palm Pre – even though I don’t leave the house much, when I am out, my Palm Pre keeps me connected. I previously had a Motorola Q, and the Pre is such a huge step up. I keep up on my email, Twitter, can take quality photos… it’s an amazing device, and I’m glad I went this route versus a BlackBerry.

Skype sits in-between a telephone and instant messenger and has lately become an important tool that I use daily. While I still IM via AIM and have a phone line in my office, Skype allows others to see if I’m available, send me an IM first, then quickly initiate a call to take care of business. In addition, being able to talk to an affiliate manager and conferencing in the merchant is invaluable.affiliate marketer specializing in PPC and SEO. What this means is he does Internet marketing for other companies, and makes money when they make money. Eric also shares in depth how tos and tips on affiliate marketing on his blog – a recent series on How to Build a Datafeed Site is just one example.

Eric’s essential tools – in his own words, of course:
Just try to mess with Jessica Simpson.

After the ribbing she has taken in the past year, chances are you won't get very far.

She has been called fat, lonely, you name it — yet she's about to open herself up to the public again, despite what criticism it may invite.

"Right now I'm so numb to it I wouldn't take offense," says Simpson, who takes viewers on a journey of personal discovery through her VH1 show, The Price of Beauty (premieres tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT). "I've allowed my life to be public, and that is my responsibility. I can't expect people to not have opinions on how you live your life."

Simpson, 29, who launched a singing career as a teen and rose to fame through her hit MTV reality show Newlyweds, has been a tabloid fixture — one that has only escalated since her divorce from Nick Lachey in 2006.

In the past year, Simpson has come under scrutiny for her love life, including a high-profile breakup with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, and she has been criticized about her weight and appearance .

"At the time I just didn't talk about it at all. I just didn't want to give it any attention," Simpson says. "I thought the best way to do it was to discover beauty by myself. I think the world kind of gave me this favor. I don't think I would have been as receptive to the idea of this show until now."

In Beauty, Simpson sets out with longtime friends Cacee Cobb and Ken Paves— who doubles as her hairstylist — and travels around the world ("And I wear really great shoes," she jokes) to learn about the lengths women will go to to feel beautiful. A trip to Thailand examined women who wanted to lighten their skin color, and a visit to Uganda explored a tribal ritual of pre-wedding weight gain. "Can you imagine?" Simpson says. "It's amazing. Men want their women to be fat because their prized possession is their cow."

Simpson says the timing for the show was just right. "I did hear the concept (for the show), and at the time I was really struggling and I was like, 'Is this (my weight) ever going to stop selling magazines? Why is my weight such an issue, especially when it's probably five pounds?' "

"It's so trying, because daily women are obsessed with the way that they look and what they see when they look in the mirror," Simpson says. "A majority of women who would have gone through what I went through this year ... being a public embarrassment, I don't think they could have handled it. I was on tour (with Rascal Flatts), and I had to get up on stage every night and just know that people were looking to see whether I was fat or not. You walk by 10 magazine covers and it's you and these stupid jeans."
So far, like this year's basketball tournament, we've had our share of upsets.  For those of you who don't follow basketball, although the upsets are usually the BEST PART of the tournament, the first round of both March Madness and Fug Madness are designed so that the number one seeds (in basketball, these are the best teams; at GFY, it's most fugly celebs) have an easy couple of games and don't meet their biggest competition until later on, with the hope that the FINAL game will pit the two very best (fugliest) in one final head-to-head. That's why someone like Mischa gets someone like Camilla Belle in her first game. It's almost like a gimme for the one seed...but sometimes, the underdog comes from behind and when that happens, it's AWESOME.  What will today bring? We'll soon find out. But until then, a brief teaser for the Fug Match-Ups you'll see on Monday: Well, this ought to be interesting: the wackily-attired socialite versus the barely-attired "actress." Place your bets now, but I think this one could go down to the wire. In the first round, Fab blew through Carrie Underwood like she was the favorite and not Carrie -- we like that kind of confidence from a bizarrely-garbed random -- and Pammy spanked Drew Barrymore, despite the fact that Drew looked like a lunatic most of next year, what with the heinous leggings and the two-tone hair. What happens when two spoilers go up against each other? We're about to find out. I'm super excited to see how this one shakes out. Both ladies handily dispatched their round one opponents -- Rumer Willis and Nicole Kidman, respectively. Both are musicians prone to wearing SUPER CRAZY costumes and neither has ever met a headdress she didn't immediately put on and wear out. Could Juliette take down Katy? Stranger things have happened.
Comprehensive health care reform will cost the federal government $940 billion over a ten-year period, but will increase revenue and cut other costs by a greater amount, leading to a reduction of $138 billion in the federal deficit over the same period, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, a Democratic source tells HuffPost. It will cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion over the second ten year period.

The source said it also extends Medicare’s solvency by at least nine years and reduces the rate of its growth by 1.4 percent, while closing the doughnut hole for seniors, meaning there will no longer be a gap in coverage of medication. The CBO also estimated it would extend coverage to 32 million additional people.

The CBO score is the last piece House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was waiting on before putting the puzzle together on the House floor. A contingent of Blue Dogs has been holding out support, insisting that the bill be fully paid for and not increase the deficit. The numbers give a major boost to Pelosi and her leadership team, which can now begin the whip count in earnest and can specifically point to the cost savings.

With the CBO score released, the Democratic whip team has a specific, thoroughly-analyzed bill to show to undeclared members who can no longer claim they are “waiting to see the language.” Pelosi has very little room for error and needs to move nearly every undecided voter to a solid “yes.”

Since the House last passed legislation in November, three Democrats who opposed it — John Tanner and Bart Gordon of Tennessee and Brian Baird of Washington — have announced their retirements, relieving them of some political pressure to oppose the bill. Pelosi may end up drawing on those exiting members for a cushion of support.
Next week begins the 2010 Human Capital Summit in Arizona; here's sneak peek at some of the things I'm most looking forward to!  Remember, Joy, Amy and I will be live blogging (www.hci.org) throughout the event for all members who can't join us in-person.

Also, as an industry first we are providing our keynote presentations globally via video webcast for you to access live. While there is no substitute for the networking and peer to peer collaboration that happens at live events, budgets are tight and travel has been reduced fore many. Register here!

Monday will be the kick off, with welcome remarks by Michael Foster, Chairman and CEO, Human Capital Institute and  Michael Gregoire, Chairman and CEO, Taleo.  Next up we can't wait to hear from Geoff Colvin, author of Talent is Overrated, as he discusses "The Upside of the Downturn".  The session view is that top performing leaders reject the common view that slashing costs and firing employees are all that matter in tough times. They see downturns as rich opportunities to reinvent their organization and lay the groundwork for future growth. What a way to kick off the Summit!

I'm also really interested in the next two speakers, Blake Mycoskie, CEO, TOMS Shoes and Jim Carroll, International Futurist, Trends & Innovation Expert, Author of Surviving the Information Age.  Their sessions are titled The New Rules for Tomorrow's Business: Moving Towards Passion vs. Payoff and 7 Things You Need To Do Right Now: Aligning the Fast Future to Your Current Strategy .  I like that all of these sessions have a great "forward moving" feel-- let's get past the downturn and look at what human capital can be doing to build for a great tomorrow.

I'm going to stop there on discussing sessions because there are over 50 great meetings and you can read about them right after they happen in my blog. Looking forward as well to lots of time to network and reconnect with HCI members-- and of course for the Around the World Wine and Tequila Tasting.

See you in Arizona!
If you have a smart phone, chances are good that you add to its functionality pretty often by downloading new software apps. But updating the computer systems built into your car usually requires a long visit to the dealership, where company technicians install new software using special interfaces. Ford has begun changing that paradigm with its Sync and MyFord Touch systems, and by opening the Sync programming interfaces to mobile app developers. In January, Ford, Pandora, Stitcher, and Orangatame debuted Sync-enabled software that allow drivers to use the car's voice-recognition and speech-synthesis systems to interact with Internet-based streaming radio and Twitter apps running on the driver's phone. Now Ford is looking to do much more than simply create in-car versions of existing smart phone applications. With the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and Microsoft, Ford is providing expertise for a computer science and engineering course called "Cloud Computing in the Commute." Students in the class will work in small teams to design, build, and demonstrate automotive telematics applications. "The services you care about when you're driving are different from those you use when you're walking around with your phone," says T.J. Giuli, a software engineer in Ford's Infotronics Research and Advanced Engineering division, who is co-teaching the class with Michigan professors Brian Noble and Jason Flinn. The software development platform for the class is based on Microsoft's Windows 7 and Robotics Developer Studio and will provide access to vehicle performance data, networking services, voice recognition, text-to-speech, and Internet services such as social networking platforms, as well as to the Windows Azure cloud computing environment.
You may have seen another of my posts and noticed that I make ethic dishes that take a lot of work.  I'm fascinated by foods that people feel passionate about.  I don't mind taking the time and effort to learn to make them.  I also happen to be shamelessly nerdy!

Last week I made sushi.  I had a large bag of glutinous rice, ingredients for california roll, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and jalapenos.  I sliced and slivered according to the diagrams in my sushi cookbooks and even made two types of spicy mayonnaise for dipping sauce.

Then, I cooked the rice. I followed the package directions.  I timed, I seasoned with spiced vinegar, I cooked, I fanned. I failed.  It was too moist, tasted metallic and stuck to my teeth.  I dumped it in the trash can, muttering to myself.

I tried again, this time steaming the rice longer.  Again with the timer, the vinegar, the fan, and still, no good.  It looked fine, but it was still raw.  I hated dumping it yet again, and I felt a little crazy as I shoveled it into the bin.

I went to You Tube for video support.  I watched four videos, viewing four entirely unique procedures: rice cooker, no cooker, fanning, no fanning.  However, they all washed the rice many times before cooking it, which my instructions had listed as an optional step.  

I started over.  I rinsed the rice eight times, until it no longer yielded the cloud of starch in the wash water.  I left it to drain the recommended 10 minutes, and proceeded as before.  This time I  let the rice boil for a few minutes before turning down the heat for the steaming phase, and I left the rice to steam an extra five minutes to make sure it absorbed all the water.  I seasoned it, and fanned it, and it WORKED!  It tasted good, and had a nice texture, with a pearly shine on the grains.

I wish I could tell you the assembly process was elegant and neat.  I had the rolling technique in my head, but not my hands.  I did manage to get the rolls to hold together firmly, but the fillings were not centered.  Once sliced, they resembled colorful 'googly' eyes on the plate. Sticky rice adorned every surface of the kitchen, my clothing, and my hands, but I had five rolls of handcrafted sushi to show for it.  My feet and back ached, but I was so satisfied.

We ate the crooked sushi like hungry little piggies.  It was tasty, with the rich flavors of the soy sauce, wasabi, and chipotle mayo dipping sauces.  The frustration of the past three hours smoothed away in the fresh and creamy avocado, cucumber, and salmon bliss.
Today it is the first day of spring, and for those of us in the northern hemisphere, it is the season of renewal. (For those of you in the southern hemisphere, please humor me and think back to a few months ago. ;) ) Few things make me feel as alive as when I see the first sprouts of green grass, fresh leaves, and colorful flowers taking place of the lifeless landscape that’s dominated for the last six months. Never mind that it’s not even 30 degrees where I live today (thanks, Arctic chill that blew in yesterday). Even in my frigid corner of the world, the snow is melting and the days are warmer; we’re expecting a high of 54 tomorrow, so I’m not completely living in a fantasy. Surviving yet another wretched winter gives me hope, and in celebration, I make a list of at least five things I want to accomplish during the spring season each year. This helps me feel like I’m kicking ass and making the most of my favorite months of the year. Here’s my list for spring 2010:

   1. Survive Latin 1020, by far the hardest class I have taken and must pass in order to graduate this summer. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m hanging in there, and I’m writing this here as a reminder of how important it is that I keep working hard until the very end.
   2. Upon passing Latin 1020, my next goal is graduating this summer! Even though I technically won’t finish until the end of summer semester, I still get to walk in the ceremony this May. I’m stoked.
   3. Before my family comes to see me walk, I will give my house a thorough spring cleaning. Since school started, I have only been doing the housework that’s been absolutely necessary. I’d rather not have them all think that we’ve been living like slobs since we’ve moved here…even if that really is the truth. :P
   4. I will listen to music, take photographs, write, and satiate my creative drive by making time for even the smallest of things that will inspire me every day. Carpe diem.
   5. I will consume fewer aspartame-laden drinks and, darn it, drink WATER instead! I have difficulty with this, despite my hunch that aspartame is what has been killing off my short-term memory in the nine years I have been drinking it.
If you’re showcasing a product on your website or in a print ad, you can make it look more professional by giving it a decent background and by adding a few special effects.

For my “product,” I’m using a photograph of a non-descript media player which I downloaded for free, here from Stock Xchng. Thanks to Pzado. 1. Create a new Photoshop document. For this example, set it to 800 x 600 pixels with a resolution of 72ppi.

2. Fill the entire document with black by pressing D to set the Foreground color to black and then pressing Alt + Backspace (windows) or Option + Delete (Mac). 3. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the toolbar and draw out a circular marquee. Hold down Shift to constrain it to a perfect circle as you drag. Fill the circle with white. Press Ctrl + D (windows) or Cmd + D (Mac) to deselect the circle. 15. Now to make the reflection fade away a little more authentically, we’ll add a layer mask. Make sure your reflected layer is selected in the layers palette, then click on the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the Layers palette. A white thumbnail appears on the layer. Click on the thumbnail to select it. Now select the Gradient tool and choose a Foreground to Background gradient.
About 6 months ago, I had a severe acute asthma attack and was hospitalised for 10 days, requiring IV theophylline and oral steroids. I was on steroids for about six weeks, at about 40mg a day. Before I went into hospital, I was 10 stone 6lbs but after, was 12 stone!!!! (I am 5ft 8). My exercise levels dipped for a few mnths - it took ages to get back on track. Prior to the attack, I was walking abt 12000 steps a day & doing some exercise (about 3 x 30 mins a wk). I am not a big fan of running or heavy cardio, as it makes me breathless which can make me panic. I walk briskly (4 - 4.5 mph). Currently I'm also hoola hooping about 4 times a week for 30 - 45 mins with a DVD which really causes me to sweat! However, the weight loss is SLOW. I only started seriously in Jan and now go up and down between 11st 4 and 11st 6. I am SO careful with what I eat - lots of wholegrains, fruit and veg, lower fat meat etc but it just won't shift. It is making me miserable. Help please! PS yes, I probably did eat more than usual (increased appetite is a side effect of oral steroids) and as I've said, I also reduced my regular exercise as I was unwell. Calories in up, calories out down = weight gain. I'm not stupid. I'm not interested in discussing HOW I gained the weight, I'm interested in HOW I can get rid of it, given that I now walk 3 - 4 miles a day and eat 1500 calories a day? Also, to be fair, as I slept for most of the time I was off ill, I can't see how I would have gained 21 - 22lbs in six weeks as this would entail increased consumption of 1833 calories a day in addition to what I needed anyway?
Well, since I last wrote, I've been to Starkville MS and Auburn Alabama for two UGA women's basketball games. Unfortunately we lost both of them, but after returning late last night from one of the games, I don't want to talk about it! We will definitely have better days! When I went to Auburn, we went on a bus trip with other booster club members. This is usually fun and I won't say it wasn't fun -- i just didn't enjoy it as much and not because we lost. My intention was to get there early enough to get in the front or the back of the bus because of the noise. I knew that if I was sitting in the middle that I would be bombarded by noise coming at me from all angles. Well, my best laid plans as they say didn't work out. I was right in the middle. I did have my earplugs which were a godsend, but I was still not comfortable and was only hoping the bus driver would go faster and faster to get there. We stopped for lunch and I chose not to eat in the restaurant because it was too noisy so I got a little break from it. Coming back wasn't as bad, because we were coming back late and because the crowd was a little more subdued because we lost. I'm not sure if I'll be doing that trip again. Next Monday -- we are off to the capitol in Atlanta for Alzheimer's Awareness Day. Hopefully we will have a good turnout.
Some people are so afraid of legalism that they would simply throw up their hands in disgust at this entire post. Others will no doubt quote the Scripture about "physical exercise profiting little" as a rebuke to me, suggesting that it would be far more godly for me to be a couch potato and do little or nothing to prevent/forestall my genetic ticking time bomb of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity, and osteoporosis. But I am too grateful for the gift God has entrusted in my care: my physical body. Oh, it's quite plain, boring and used up by contemporary standards, but it has been a blessing to me. It has borne six children. It is the tool I use to enable me to serve God in my daily life. Why should I not take care of it as my way of thanking God? Why should I not be a good steward of my health? Besides, the Bible is clear that gluttony is a sin, modern ideas to the contrary. Binge eating is not cool. Eating like a pig is not a sign of healthy masculinity. Pretending it's more gluttonous to be health-conscious and watch what one eats than it is to eat everything in sight is...plain goofy. Being overweight or obese is not a sin. But the way that most of us get there is. Yes, there are some people who will always be "overweight" though fit and healthy. But obesity is a different matter. Yes, in a few cases, there are medical conditions that prevent a person from losing weight, no matter how hard they work out or how carefully they eat. But that is far from common. There has been a big brouhaha over on the Bayly Blog about obesity. I know one of the parties that has weighed in. (Haha...poor attempt at humor there.) I think it's interesting that some people are so afraid to admit that, in most cases, obesity is easily preventable and is caused directly by two things: eating too much and not moving enough. But I guess it's horribly judgmental to say that. Horribly judgmental to think that men who show off how fat they are maybe, just maybe should be ashamed rather than proud...not necessarily ashamed for being fat, but for what they almost certainly had to do (eat too much and work too little) to get that way.
I thought it would be appropriate to share with you an excerpt from my book, Safe At Home, about playoff baseball. So enjoy! And Go Blue! What I've learned about the playoffs and the Word Series is to be very, very excited. But not too excited. It's not that I don't appreciate the postseason. I do. And it's not that I don't recognize the majesty of St. Louis Cardinal Jack Clark taking Tom Niedenfuer deep in Game 6 of the 1985 National League Championship Series. And it's not that I don't long to see the Dodgers win a World Series again. But the truth is, part of who wins that classic matchup is based on the same factors as who wins a regular-season game -- skill, smart managing, the ability to bounce back, and luck. That's what makes the game great. Still the notion that postseason games are somehow more important, or more pressure-packed, or more, I don't know, special than a contest in the middle of May, or July, or even April, obscures a larger truth, which is this: Every game is special, and it's how a player performs in each game, and in every game, that determines his success, not how he plays in one series. For years, I had pretty limited postseason experience (quite limited actually), but like so many fans before me, I learned the risks of postseason exuberance the hard way in the fall of 2008. I found myself an adult in a whole new baseball situation as I watched my Dodgers win a postseason series and move on to the NLCS. We hadn't won a postseason series since 1988, when I was just fifteen, but I had always appreciated postseason ball. It was fun to watch the games of the fall even if my heart wasn't emotionally invested in the teams that were playing. I could really just sit back and appreciate the fundamentals at their best. Last fall proved different. I wasn't just invested in who won, I was all in. I sat in my seat with a white-knuckled, sweaty-palmed death grip on whatever I was holding at the time. Every pitch meant something. Every out. Every managerial move. Every call by the ump. The fans were alive. They stood when there were two outs and two strikes, waving those rally towels as if they possessed magical powers to make the batter strike out. "Throw him the chair!" my brother screamed. Translation: "Sit him down." As you might expect, losing to the Phillies in the NLCS last year was devastating. My brother and I were inconsolable. As lame as it might sound, a little piece of my heart broke that night. An even bigger piece of my brother's heart broke that night. The game that we were eliminated in was at Dodger Stadium, and we stayed for about an hour after the last out. In that hour, players came out for curtain calls and blew kisses to the fans that were still there. I would say over a thousand fans stayed, and we were a rowdy bunch. Frank McCourt and his lovely wife stuck around. A chant started. "Please sign Manny." Clap, clap. Clap, clap, clap. "Please sign Manny," the Dodgers fans shouted. Nomar came out of the dugout, and the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. He waved and put his hand over his heart paying tribute to us fans. He took a long look around, soaking up the moment, his moment. It seemed like he was saying good-bye to the stadium; I hoped he wasn't saying good-bye to baseball. Tommy Lasorda said a few words into a microphone. He thanked "the best fans in baseball." He finished up his speech by saying, "When you lay your head down on the pillow tonight, say a prayer for Tommy and the Dodgers." It was a vivid moment, and while we reached a disappointing end, there was something strangely uplifting about the whole scene. As we were walking to the car, I saw daddies holding sleepy kids with their baseball gloves still on, draped over their father's backs. I found solace in the idea that even though we weren't moving on to the World Series, memories were made that night. The children of the fans from '88 had their own stories to tell. A whole new generation of Dodger fans got to experience NLCS baseball for the first time. And who knows, maybe one of these years we'll actually win. PEACE, LOVE, AND BASEBALL, Alyssa
I'm writing this blog post from Sun City Center, Florida which has been unseasonably cold since I got here on Tuesday night. I am here until this coming Tuesday visiting my parents on vacation. I had planned on keeping my vacation pretty simple and had hoped to spend most of the time in the pool! It's been way too cold to go in the pool!! I had also planned NOT to work while I was here!!! I have been forced to re-evaluate my plan! Well, here it is Sunday and after 4 days of not working, I'm back at work!! My creative ideas and my excitement are flowing. I am choosing to go with go with the flow and get back to work. One of the things I am really excited about is a new ADHD Coaching option that I will begin to offer on March 15th! As many of you know, Terry Matlen and I offer online coaching through the ADD Action Club. As an ADHD Coach I really love the ADD Action Club and the online coaching format. In addition to the ADD Action Club will also be offering individual online Coaching too. Keep an eye out for more information about my new Unlimited Online ADHD Coaching package.
I went to a wonderful event today for "Kids In Sports". The goal of this great organization is to create community led after school sports programs for children and youth in underserved areas of Los Angeles County. In 1996, KIS initiated the Girls In Recreation, Leadership and Sports (GIRLS) Program to recruit and attract young girls to the sports clubs. At the luncheon, Kim Ng was honored for her excellence in raising awareness for women in sports. For those of my blog readers that may not be Dodgers fans and don't know, Kim Ng was the youngest person to present a salary arbitration case in the major leagues at age 26. She has three World Series rings from when she was the Yankees assistant GM. She is the first woman to interview for a general manager's position in Major League Baseball history. Recently, she was picked as one of the most influential people in the game by Baseball America. AND Kim Ng is the Vice President and Assistant General Manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. I have always been an admirer of Ms. Ng. I would imagine that she doesn't want to be known as a trailblazer. Like any woman who has achieved absolute greatness, she wants to be recognized for her brain and talent, not her gender. But, my God, what an amazing role model she is for women everywhere. When she accepted the award, she spoke of growing up and what sports meant to her and her sisters (she is the oldest of 5). With humility, she told the crowd how sports gave her self-esteem during those pivotal years of teen development, and taught her of teamwork and commitment. Playing sports as a young girl, gave her the foundation to grow into the smart, successful, business, woman she is today. The words Kim shared are actually statistically proven. Girls who play sports have higher levels of self-esteem. They have a more positive body image. They have the experience of success, learn of the hard work to achieve goals and how to deal with failure. Kim Ng is a great spokesperson for the game of baseball and inspired me today. After Kim accepted her award, she graciously took a picture with me. In that fleeting moment, I thought about asking her what the Dodgers were going to do with the bullpen or if she had any plans to get another set up guy or a starter (that could maybe go more than four innings, maybe? Please?). But somehow, in that moment, baseball didn't seem relevant. I wasn't there as a fan of the Dodgers. I was there as a fan of Kim Ng. Peace, Love, AND BASEBALL, Alyssa
Well it's been a while since I promised to report back - due in no small part to the fact that it took me so long to get to my GP appointment. Don't ask. One appointment was accidentally cancelled by the surgery, one I forgot to go to because I had a tummy bug, another one co incided with another appointment and so it went on. But here I am - finally - with news!! I had, in between attempts to get to my GP, an appointment at the Pain Clinic with a Pain Nurse. I told her about my failed attempt to increase the dose of Pregabalin and she loaned me an NHS Tens Machine! To say that this simple little device is streets ahead of the all singing all dancing thing that I bought from the chemist would be a massive understatement. Even I can understand the instructions and use this one!
Those of you who have read this blog for any length of time know that I have been quite candid about my own struggle with gluttony. And, yes, it's an uncomfortable and extremely unpopular topic to talk about. I've been a skinny glutton, with a high metabolism that kept me from gaining weight. And I've also been a...well, less-than-skinny glutton. So I don't equate gluttony with being overweight or being obese. I also know that "overweight" is a loaded term, and one that can be difficult to define. According to one medical weight chart, I am currently, at 130 pounds, overweight for my age, height, and frame size. I could make excuses, insist that I am healthy at this weight, etc., etc. but I know the real truth: I am at this weight because I've been eating too much and not exercising as much as I should, especially over the holidays. For some people of approximately my size, 130 pounds would be a wonderful weight. The weight chart says I should be at around 115 - 120. I know that, at this stage in my life, I don't want to drop that many pounds. But I do know that I can't use that as an excuse to indulge my appetites.
This is WAY cool! I haven't blogged for a while, but I just had to share this! Ferrofluid is a liquid that becomes polarised in the presence of a magnetic field. Here's the technical definition, straight from Wikipedia: "Ferrofluids are composed of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid, usually an organic solvent or water. The particles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration. Although the name may suggest otherwise, ferrofluids do not display ferromagnetism, since they do not retain magnetization in the absence of an externally applied field. In fact, ferrofluids display (bulk-scale) paramagnetism, and are often referred to as being "superparamagnetic" due to their large magnetic susceptibility." A bunch of scientific mumbo-jumbo to me, I'm afraid, but the behaviour of the fluid is fascinating to watch. This YouTube clip is wonderfully entertaining and demonstrates the fluid's seemingly impossible properties. There are lots of examples on YouTube, accompanied — not surprisingly — by abundant debate re whether or not it's CGI fakery. There's even a television commercial using the fluid. Kinda reminds me of those 50's Wooly Willy toys we had as kids, with a goofy-looking guy and iron filings you dragged around with a magnet, to give him hair and a beard. Ain't the web grand?! Every now and then, one tends to forget the incredible marvels this technology has brought to our desktops.
Aha, here I am again. Medicine Run-down – 90mg Cymbalta, 20mg Abilify, 12.5mg Ambien, and 200mg Lamictal. 900000 mg nicotine from my cigs I am just coming out of a major depressive bout. I must say it was a rough one. I've been drawing some though and trying to keep spirits up. I usually don't do well this time of year. From the day the time changed I have been up and down and mainly down. I think I am finally adjusting. Ive been drawing a lot. If anyone is interested, check out some stuff I did at deviantart. Its at http://sunraven0.deviantart.com Tonight we have to go to a Christmas Party. My stomach has been acting up, so I don't exactly know how I'll make it, but I will. It will probably be fun, and hey – Olive Garden is always good. Anyway, my mood feels a bit more stable. My Abilify was increased a bit, so I guess that helped. I've also been trying to drink more water and watch my wheat intake. I don't know if it will help, but hell, its got to be good for you. Hope all is well with everyone. I am trying to think of things to read and draw so any suggestions are welcome. If I draw something you suggest, I'll post it on deviantart so you can see it.
I took B. into the pediatrician today to get a vaccination. We split them up by a few months this year, not because I think vaccines caused their autism, but just because ??? Who knows? It just felt like a good thing to do. Our pediatrician is finally back in the original office, after months of repairs from Hurrican Ike. As far as I can tell, they spent a huge chunk of the insurance money on the mother of all fish tanks. They've always had a tiny one, and the only interest B. has shown in it was watching the bubbles rise. Well, today he could not stop bouncing around and staring at it. Then I realized he was saying, "Goldfish, goldfish, what do you see?" (from the book Brown Bear, Brown Bear, by Eric Carle, which G. recites in its entirety frequently throughout the day). I was so excited, because B. never used to show that he was noticing things in the environment, not to mention knew their names! I kept smiling proudly, as he jumped around the waiting room. Other people looked uncomfortable, and didn't meet my eye, and I can see that he was acting weird, in terms of usual waiting room behavior. But I was so happy! Then, when the nurse was about to give him the shot, she said "One, two, three...", and he said in the saddest little voice, "four, five, six". He also slapped her hand when she said "give me five", and said "bye, bye" when I asked him to. I was walking around with a goofy grin for an hour or so afterward, I'm sure.

Okay, I know I'm already slacking on my work out blog but I promise I wasn't slacking on the soccer Field tonight. The new season started tonight and I'm so thankful because I know that is what kept me lean this past year while I was taking my break from the gym, and also cause it's super fun to tackle grown men. Tonight I was a little displaced because it's been over two month since I've really played and I need to get back into the game. I actually have not had any fears about breaking my nose again which is good.... I think....only if I don't break it again. Tonight was pretty low key and I didn't end up on the ground at all and was only pushed and had my foot stepped on once. Oh and I didn't send any guys to the grown.... kinda boring.... but a good way to get back into the game. What I did have was the assist to the only goal of the game and it happened to be to my man Scottie who sunk it in the net beautifully. It was great because those of you who know me know that the first time I met him he was being super cocky. We met the night before we played in a soccer tournament together and his first words were "Hi, I'm Scott. I'll be scoring all the goals tomorrow, so when you get the ball just kick it to me." Funny thing was he kinda wasn't joking.... He was joking when he said it that night; but I did kick it to him the next day and he did score that goal and most the others that day. So that is always a running joke between us; I'm just following orders when I kick it to him. Anyway even though I've been slacking a little on the blog, I've still been working out. I'll be better about posting this week.
I received a John Tesh daily calendar for Christmas, and more often than not, I can link his messages to my RA life. See if any of these quotes from his calendar don't also apply to you and your RA: May 15 -Feeling Tired? If you're feeling sluggish, drink a glass of water. Experts say one of the first signs of dehydration is fatigue, so down a glass of water to perk up. Have you ever met an RA sufferer that didn't complain of fatigue? Let's give it a shot and see if we don't feel a little more perky. May 14 - Relieve Stress. If you're stressed out, have a popsicle. Why? Stress causes the muscles in your jaw and neck to stiffen, which decreases the amount of blood and oxygen that reaches your brain, and leaves you feeling stressed. But eating something cold relaxes those muscles, and makes you calm down. May 22- Tip to help you calm down. Focus on the good! Whenever you feel anxious, focus on something or someone you appreciate - like your spouse or your pet. Doing that will shift your focus to stress-free thoughts, which will help regulate your heartbeat. And new research shows that keeping your heartbeat rhythms at a smooth rate will short-circuit the tension in your body. Stress is one of my big RA triggers for inflammation. How about you? The next time I see someone eating a popsicle and talking to imaginary friends, I'll just know they're practicing some of John Tesh's techniques to relieve stress and calm down. Just eating a popsicle makes me feel happy and carefree! Add the vision of my smiling little Yorkie dog or my loving husband to the picture, and I shouldn't have a worry in the world! John, you're a genius!
When I was of early school-age, my family did not have a lot of money. The reason I know that is not because I knew explicitly that there was no money. In fact, I only came to understand that later over time. Looking back my favorite food was baked beans and my sibling's was macaroni and cheese. So I didn't have high brow taste as a kid. The "organic" and the "slow food" movement was not around back in the 1980's when I was in grade school. However, my mother never got us fast food and I didn't even sip soda until I was 5 years old. Because of my mom's vigilance, I don't drink soda (maybe root beer every six months) and I only eat fast food if it's the only option (again once every couple months). When I make dinner for my husband and my toddler, I focus on very simple, quick meals. Normally I try to make sure we have one thing from the following food groups: one grain, one veggie, and one meat. Sometimes I do make our meal with something from a can (actually baked beans maybe once a month), but more likely I get our food from the freezer (especially frozen veggies). We also like to go out to eat for dinner once every weekend and usually got out for Thai food.
Yesterday was the first day of third grade for Ethan. He was very excited and we're very optimistic for the school year. He's got a great teacher and he has four friends from previous years that have been in class with him. He said he had a good day and that they were going to be learning lots of new things this year. He had a lot of fun over the summer and I also spent time working with him on his cursive and his reading comprehension. The biggest issue right now is making inferences and I plan to do some research to see if there are any techniques for helping children on the spectrum learn to make inferences and predictions. (Besides simply doing practice worksheets w/reading a questions, etc.) I'm looking for something that's more of a systematic program to help build skills for creativity, imagination, and most important: making inferences and using deductive reasoning. In other cool news, there's this nurse practioners website that likes to create various lists of internet resources for all sorts of different medical resources. They recently put out a “Top 50 Autism Support and Research Blogs” and my little blog here is listed #2 (not a ranking just a happy coincidence of listing). Check it out.
 Back in the day, I worked--- mostly nights --- at a university hospital, as a ward clerk. As part of my job, I met quite a few security guards, of which a significant number were either in law enforcement, had been in law enforcement, or planned to be. Around that same time, I read the LA Times...a lot...and there was a lot of bad news about the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. There was also bad news about the LAPD. One night in the emergency room, a sheriff tried to impress me with the fact that he had beaten up some guy in the course of arresting him. The sheriff looked completely unruffled. The young man he'd arrested was extremely bloodied and had a couple broken bones. I was not impressed. In fact, I was sickened and disgusted. Of course, I don't know the story of this man's arrest. But, a few years later, I was an eyewitness, more than once, to what I can only describe as unprovoked police brutality. There were some other dealings with police over the years. Some good, some bad. But I grew cynical about the sort of person that was attracted to police work, and about what police work eventually did to even the best of people. And then I met two police officers who made me toss out all those stereotypes and prejudices. One morning, after a long night shift, these two men, practically strangers to us, cheerfully helped us move, joking and laughing as they easily carried our heavy bookcases upstairs, actually seeming to enjoy the hard work, and apologizing that they couldn't stay all day, but had to get some sleep before their next shift.
Unfortunately, the only real relief is anti-inflammatory meds, keeping it elevated and......rest. Anything to keep the wrist from bending too much and putting strain on those soft tissues is beneficial such as a wrist brace. At one point, mine was so bad that I could not hang onto a drinking glass...my hand would just "let go". I did eventually have surgery and it was the best thing I could have done as I was on the verge of nerve damage from all the years with cts. And yes, yard work made it much worse, especially the string trimmer. I also know that being overweight causes the pain/discomfort to increase.
The beta version of SnapVillage — Corbis' long-awaited foray into the microstock arena — debuted a few days ago. I've done quite well online with some of the other microstock sites, so I was curious about how the traditional stock photography giant might approach the business of microstock. They had, after all, been slow to acknowledge the seriousness of the mounting competition coming from this quarter. So far, I'm colossally unimpressed. I uploaded half a dozen images over a week ago, and as of this writing they still aren't processed. No acknowledgment at all. Worse, the site times out quickly after the upload completes, so that if you do not immediately enter descriptions and keywords (that's right, the site doesn't support embedded IPTC information), you're bounced out, and you have to RE-LOAD everything all over again. I was not impressed with the lack of support for IPTC data, which is pretty standard in the industry, as is the ability to upload via FTP. The site is still in beta, so one can only hope these features will be coming shortly. If they don't, SnapVillage will fail to attract professional photographers who have come to rely on such functionality at other microstock sites. The quality of the existing images is poor, but then — in fairness — I guess Corbis faces a bit of a branding dilemma. They need to somehow differentiate this site from their costly "high-end" site. Unfortunately for them, some of the other microstocks have really raised the bar. Sites like Shutterstock, iStockPhoto, and DreamsTime feature excellent photographers and many professional quality images. Corbis is late off the mark, and disdain virtually oozes from this site. It's evident in the name they chose — snapvillage — the word "snap" more than a little denigrating in its suggestion of casual snapshots rather than serious photography. It's almost as if they're targetting the Flickr amateur shutterbug crowd. Indeed, some of the images look like they came straight from the worst of Flickr. All in all a failing score. One would expect more from a company backed by the Corbis brand and bankrolled by Bill Gates.
My name is Kim and I am another newbie to the blog. I am 28 years old and was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis 2 1/2 years ago. I take a lot of medication, which at the moment doesn't seem to be working, I am currently on 22.5mg of Methotrexate weekly, Hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day, Diclofenac 50mg three times a day plus pain killers to help control the pain and I occasionally have steroid injections when I have a flare up which is more often than not at the moment. My RA first started in my hands and wrists but has gradually spread to other parts of my body, my feet being the worst with arthritic nodules popping up. I have an appointment in a couple of weeks to see a podiatrist I am hoping they will help with the constant pain in my toes, my RA nurse and Dr always tell me to wear flat shoes and trainers but to be honest it doesn't make a difference what footwear I have on the pain is continuous...i'd be happy wearing my slippers all day they give me the most confort but i'd look a bit stupid walking around work in my fluffy yellow slippers :-)
Oh wow, it's been awhile my blogger buddies! Sorry it's been so long, I've been very busy! We are starting to potty train Shaylee....it's going pretty well, she hasn't really peed in the potty but she has gone "Number two" almost everyday in her potty. She just needs to know the feeling of when she has to pee....it might take awhile! Things have been good here, John is working like crazy....as usual! He'll have a nice break over new years though. Shayle is still loving school, Next year she'll be headed for Kindergarten. My monroe is healed and I LOVE IT!! I get so many compliments on it, it feel like second skin, I hardly feel it. It's so stinking cute! I messed up my hair for the holidays too.....I cut BANGS....short kindergarten mom cut my bangs...bangs. EEEK! Sooo..... With Christmas coming up at light speed....I have a few of my favorite Christmas things to share.
I went on my search engine and typed "How long can a person go without food" and found that it could be pretty long. especially a person like me. I also found out, actually it verified the fact that I cannot go without water for more than a week. Everything hurts when I try to eat. EVERYTHING. I tried everything so I decided not to eat anything. I am in pain all the time and I am sick of it so today I had lots of ice, one cup of coffee and a teaspoon of peanut butter. I regretted the coffee and peanut butter because even though it was easier on the esophagus, it hurt like heck when it reached my stomach. So there is no winning. I woke up at one-thirty this afternoon because I was in such pain last night and stayed in bed all day, except to make my coffee and eat the dreadful peanut butter.
I'm OFF the Carafate!! Everything seems to be doing OK now that I have finished three rounds of the Carafate. This has to be taken an hour before eating and at bedtime, and it coats the stomach lining where the infection, ulcer, irritation is, so that it can heal. It doesn't taste great, but mostly I'm glad to be off of it, because it meant remembering to take it and to be sure my stomach was empty before taking it. Adhering to the empty stomach rule put a serious dent in my herbal tea intake. But now I can get back in the habit of drinking about 8 cups a day. We've decided to cut the amount of Stevia I put in each cup in half, both as a precaution that I might have been getting too much of it each day, plus it will save money. Nothing wrong with that, and it has such a sweet taste that half a packet will do, anyway. We decided to wait a week after going off the Carafate before starting to add back in the vitamins and supplements I have been taking for the last few years, so I'm not taking as many pills right now as I'm used to. That way, if I have any digestive problems adjusting to the pills again, we'll know the problem is from the pills, not that my stomach wasn't healed yet. It's kind of nice taking so much less medicine for awhile. I am still on the MiraLax and the metamucil, and I've started eating prunes for my afternoon snack again. I can't afford to let myself get constipated, as it really throws my whole system off when I do. We've had a long record breaking cold spell here in Alabama, so I haven't been out of the house much of late. Today's our Date Day, but there are only a couple of brave souls trying to have yard sales and such, so I'm not sure what we'll do today. Our weather is getting back to normal temperature range, so it will be good just to get out of the house for awhile, no matter what we end up doing. I've even worked on a little bit of our taxes already, so I really do feel like I'm keeping my resolution to be more efficient with my time usage. It's so easy to while away the days when you're retired, if you're not careful. And now that I'm feeling better, I get a lot more done. When I don't feel well, my brain just goes into slow motion. I did have one very upsetting thing happen this last week. Out of nowhere, someone I went to high school with called me. Sadly, I didn't remember him at all. He had located me from the WHOIS information about our website. It was a very pleasant conversation, but he kept asking me if I remembered so and so, and it's all a huge blank. I can only remember a few people I went to school with, and that's mostly boys I dated LOL. I guess they made a bigger impression on me, eh? But I was very upset by the time the conversation was over. I had to tell him that I was having some memory problems to get him to stop bringing up name after name that drew a complete blank for me. It was extremely embarrassing and frustrating. So I get reminded at such times that all is not right with my brain. Between age related forgetfulness, drug related brain fog, and just plain old neurological brain fog, I am pretty much a complete blank on my past. It's scary when I allow myself to realize that, but mostly I just live for now. On a happier note, I continue to lose weight slowly, and I'm doing much better with my exercising. I'm up to 3 minutes twice a day on the treadmill, and I've recently started back on the recumbent bike for about 5 minutes twice a day. The treadmill is on an incline and not adjustable (translation = cheap), so by the time I've been on it 3 minutes my heart is really pounding. That should improve with time, though, and it's good for my heart, anyway. All in all I'm feeling very good, and hope to keep it that way, with the daily blessings God brings my way. I'm blessed to have a wonderful family who love me and I love deeply, and we all live in the same state. That's better than most people my age can say!
Here's one for chocophiles everywhere. Get your daily fix of the sweet treat with Chocomap. This new Canadian web site, sponsored by Ecole Chocolat, uses the Google Maps API to find chocolate shops throughout the world. Using the standard Google Maps interface, you can search geographically then zoom in on a location. Read brief descriptions of chocolate destinations or post your own review. There's lots of other useful information too, including recipes, chocolate e-cards, interviews with top chocolatiers, tips on cooking with chocolate, and background information about the origin and cultivation of the plant that gives us this wonderful food. Already, the site has more than 1,000 listings in over thirty countries. Definitely one for my favourites list.
And I'm not referring to anything related to pageants. When I'm teaching something new to my students, I first pre-test them to find out if they know how to do it. My pre-testing is accomplished by asking questions. Maybe a couple of them can answer my questions, but most of the time if it's truly new material, they can't. So I model or demostrate how to do it. Some students grasp material right away, but most average students require a lot of repetition and additional models. Then there are students in special education programs that require additional support including multimodal input (learning through more than just visual and auditory - oftentimes it's tactile: "let's trace an 'm' on paper,") or through cueing. In my humble opinion, modeling is teaching and the basis of learning is through imitation. To imitate well a student needs to have adequate attention and memory. I believe schools can learn how to "model" good food. Many students get either bad models or no models at home in regards to nutrition. So they come to school to learn not only reading and math, but also basic life skills that their parents aren't teaching (or aren't able to teach) them at home. I hate to add something else to the full plate (pun intended) that schools already have, but school lunches are important. Executive functions like attention and memory are supported by good nutrition. Let's teach kids what they should eat at lunch by modeling good food and giving them the best we can offer.
I went in last week for my first trimester risk assessment ultrasound and my prenatal lab work at Yale's genetic's department. I told them up front no other testing, no amnio or CVS. Anyways, the blood work came back fine with no elevation in my blood levels for Trisomy 21 or 18. My ultrasound showed that the baby has a thicker nucual thickening around its neck. Average is 3.0mm, my baby's is 3.1mm. When I was pregnant with Joey's his was almost double that that plus no nasal bone is what first made them suspect Down syndrome. His nucual thickening was severe enough to be classified as a Cystic Hygroma, but we were fortunate that it dissolved by the time he was born. This baby has a nasal bone. After ultrasound tech was finished, he went and got the doctor to take a look. Of course, the doctor saw that this baby's nucual thickening is a little abnormal. I was a little mad when he said, "I'm sorry", like he was sorry he was giving me bad news or something. I'm not worried what so ever, if this baby has Down syndrome too then God chose us to have another children with an extra chromosome, so what! I'd feel blessed to have another child with Down syndrome. Neither of us are T-21 carriers and the odd's of this child having T-21 is 1 in 45. The only reason for the odds being what they are is due to nucual thickening being what it was. Without the nucual thickening, the odd's were 1 in 100. I guess more than anything I'm mad at the doctor for saying "I'm sorry", because I'm NOT sorry, I'm happy! I'm 13 weeks pregnant and the baby is healthy. It has a nice strong heartbeat and has 2 arms and 2 legs. What more could a parent want?!
Unfortunately, the Botox hasn't been nearly as effective as it was the first round. We are pretty bummed about it but trying to remain hopeful. In an effort to really make the most of it, Darsie's foot is being serial casted tomorrow. In the first round of Botox, we saw huge improvement immediately and even more after the serial casting. So, fingers crossed that the casting is what we need to really take the Botox to the right level for her. I know that kids grow "immune" to the Botox, but after just one round?
I believe that we were meant to work hard. In today's world, for most of us, there is less and less hard work for us to do. We're all in danger of becoming soft and lazy. Recently some of my women friends were laughing about how their great-grandmothers would have found it ridiculous that they paid good money to go work out at the gym. Why not plant some crops? Toss bales of hay into a wagon all day? Put up heavy storm windows? Isn't that work enough? Seems most of us have lost the opportunity to do hard work...and we need to replace it, at the very least, with hard exercise. Unfortunately, too many of us are too lazy to do so. It's much easier to sit and indulge ourselves with our favorite foods, while pretending anyone who suggests we do otherwise is the one with the problem --- and getting annoyed if anyone suggests that obesity is, in most cases, caused by eating too much and doing too little.
Arthritis sucks! Does anybody want to 2nd my motion? In recent months, I've heard chatter within my circle, about the importance of exercising and taking care of ourselves because we're approaching the age where health concerns become real. Hearing family and friends discuss cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease and fatty livers, made me realize, I'm not exempt and have a responsibility to take care of myself. Knowing my body, limitations and capabilities, I came up with a walking plan to get myself into better shape with the hopes of avoiding future problems with my general health. The first two days were relatively easy and while I felt I'd actually made progress, I didn't feel as though I was challenging myself physically. On the third day, I slightly bumped it up a notch (extreme emphasis on the word, slightly). Increasing my speed just a little, for a short period of time, gave me a greater sense of accomplishment and the feeling of a better workout. Stepping off of the treadmill, I felt great, as if I'd ran and won a marathon (against snails mind you, but nevertheless, I did it!). Feeling good about myself, I walked away from the treadmill, humming the Rocky theme song.
Jeannette Twomey, inventor of the Kind Reminder, sent me an email recently to tell me about her product. It's a little device that plays a recorded message with the push of a large button. The caregiver can leave a simple message like, "It's Tuesday and I'll see you at 5 p.m." or any information that the dementia patient may need to access frequently. The recorder is inexpensive and 5% of the purchase price goes to the Alzheimer's Association. If my dad was still alive, I'd have no problem shelling out $20 for this! Maybe if he had had a recording of my voice to carry around, he wouldn't have forgotten me.
Every month I complete of my project, I'm going to write a reflective follow-up on what happened (please pardon me that we are already one week into February): January Stats: 18 school lunches eaten included: (4 - pizza lunches) (2 - hot dog lunches) (2 - chicken patties) (2 - cheese sandwiches) (2 - pasta dishes) (1 - PB&J that I will never forget...) (...other meals you will have to check out for yourself...) What I learned about school lunch: 1) More people than I ever expected are interested in improving school lunch and reading about my misadventures. 2) School lunches normally consist of a main dish with some some meat product (often combined with a grain), a fruit product, a vegetable product, milk, and an additional grain if the meal needs it to comply with federal regulations. 3) The meals contain a lot of processed food items. 4) The food is bland and usually tasteless. 5) There is a lot of salt in the meals and they are low in fiber for the most part What I learned about myself: 1) I finally figured out that I'm lactose-intolerant (I wasn't drinking a lot of milk before so I never knew) 2) I'm proud of myself 3) I'm enjoying the project more than I expected
Just today I read a blog post, which linked to several others, which in turn linked to yet others, which made me do some Google searches...and I discovered there is a mini-trend of women bloggers "coming out as plus-sized". Most who have "come out" are then inundated with adoring comments from fans along the lines of "What courage!" and "Now I love you even more!" and "You are so beautiful inside and out!" and even "[expletive deleted] anyone who is smaller than a size 12!" There are plenty of "Real women have curves" type remarks and diatribes against any woman who "exercises too much", is "too skinny", dares suggest that obesity might be linked to health problems, or -- even worse -- has the audacity to suggest that lack of exercise and/or overeating might contribute to obesity in any way. A plus-sized woman is applauded when she says, "I feel great about my size!" I remember the actress (but have blanked on her name) who exclaimed, "This is for all the fat girls!" when she accepted her Emmy award some years back. The crowd went wild! Everyone loved it! I think people would have been appalled, disgusted, and outraged if someone the size of Calista Flockhart would have enthused, "This is for all the skinny girls!" upon receiving an award. There would have been no end to denouncing such a woman as being unhealthy, both physically and mentally, and contributing to the eating disorders of impressionable young girls.
I have been touched by so many of your comments and everything that you have shared with me via email. It seems like there is a real need for people to share their school lunch experiences: the good, the bad, and the ugly. In the spirit of sharing and continuing the dialogue about school lunches in the US and abroad, I've started a Flickr Photo Group (see flickr badge to the right): http://www.flickr.com/groups/fedupwithschoollunch/ If you choose to join my photo group, your "homework" is to take a picture and share it. The photo can be anything related to school lunch. You might be a teacher who wants to take a photo of the lunch at your school. You might be a nutritionist who wants to highlight some really great lunches. You might be a lunch lady who wants to share some terrific (or not so terrific) meals. What are you (students, kids, teachers) eating for school lunch? Or even what great lunches have you packed for your child? I need you to know that I will be monitoring the content aggressively. The group rules include: Post only your own pictures (taken by you). Please obtain parental permission to post pictures of students' faces. If you must post pictures of students' without parental permission (as in a large group photo), please blackout their faces. Might as well get adults' permission to post their faces on the photo group. For example, you can take a picture of your own child with a lunch, because you are that child's parent. For this reason I haven't taken pictures of the cafeteria or the lunch line because I do not have parental permission to shoot the kids. You also must have a Yahoo ID to access Flickr (it's a part of Yahoo). And if you want to enjoy the photos and comment, you do need to log in with your Yahoo ID. A picture is worth a thousand words. It seems that mine are making a difference... and I want you to be a part of the School Lunch Revolution.
i have hot flushes, shooting chest pain, shortness of breath, tiredness, symptoms are not constant and do not always come together. my doc has done peek flow tests, chest x rays and general blood tests which are all clear. on listening to my heart there is no mermer and my lungs sound fine. please please help me this is going on about 2 years now and the symptoms are just getting worse i need to find out what is wrong they thought it was asma but that has now been ruled out. im 19 and female and defo not pregnant if you catch the drift ive been to hospital loads of time they cant work it out so i am asking everyone so if you have an idea what you think it might be let me no even if you think it is stupid or you will scare me or insult me you wont i am already thinking the worst and im thick skinned
Today's menu: chili, beans, tortilla chips, icee, milk So...the chili was actually quite good and I ate the beans and chips too. I couldn't bring myself to eat the icee, but I did force myself to try it. The sweetness was overpowering. I winced. I don't have a clue how much high fructose corn syrup was in it, but I couldn't stomach more than a drop or two. I talked to two of my students about what they ate at lunch. They told me they ate the icees (evidence: red stains around lips and on shirt), the chips, and the milk. The rest they threw away. Can you imagine the spike in blood sugar? I don't think that students should be offered "icees" at school. Since it's coming from the school, why would they suspect that it might be bad for them? About 30-45 minutes after lunch one of the students I interviewed seemed to "crash" physically (some tears about a minor offense from a classmate). This same student seemed pretty spaced out. What are we doing to kids?
Readers have commented about scheduling school lunch in relation to recess and how it's better to have recess before lunch.... Um... Tell me again what this "recess" is that you speak of? My school doesn't have recess. The kids get gym once a week. That's it. (Revised: the preschoolers get recess but not in the winter.) It bothers me because kids really have the need to move. And kids want to be outside even in the cold: they want to run around. With ADHD diagnoses increasing every year, it makes you wonder if we are requiring them to sit for too long. I love watching kids run around, going wild, hair flowing in the breeze, playing tag, laughing and smiling. Being kids. I love seeing their pink cheeks after gym class. That's increased blood flow to their brains! Recess in not optional. Recess needs to be required. Once I was testing a student He has test anxiety. His eyes were wide, he was fidgeting with his shirt, and his hands were trembling. We started the test and he started tanking right away. So I stopped it and said to him, "Let's do some jumping jacks!" He was confused at first, but when I did a few jumping jacks, he did some too. He had the biggest smile on his face. We sat down again and I could see that he had less tension in his body. We returned to the testing and his scores went up. A little common sense goes a long way.
I want to reiterate that I really like the lunch "ladies" at my school. These are hard-working women and men doing their job every single day. The quality of the lunches is something completely out of their control. I worked in the dishroom of my dorm cafeteria my first year of college. It was hot and smelly work standing in the spray of an industrial dishwasher. Shifts started early and you had to wear uniforms and hairnets. I was usually half-awake. Every day I would go back to my dorm room and smell like grease or fast food or...I couldn't put my finger on what exactly, but if you ever worked in food service, you know that smell. The unwritten rule is that you MUST go home and shower after your shift is over. It's not enough to take off your uniform! I had a lot of fun in that job because the other employees were college students and we got to socialize during our shifts. I made some good friends. I also knew it was not my lifetime vocation. The women and men working in the lunch room have to put up with similar conditions as I did, but they do it year after year. There's a lot of heavy-lifting, smelly food garbage, and messes made by the children. I'd like to point out that the cafeteria and what I've since of kitchen are exceptionally clean. It's a credit to these devoted professionals.
In my last post, I wrote about the benefits and drawbacks of wearing splints and tried to give some suggestions for complying with a splinting regimen. I also thought that it might be helpful to talk about splinting for kids, and from a kid's perspective. Splinting is a major treatment modality for kids. While it offers some of the same benefits as for adults, like joint protection and improved function, splints also help prevent joint deformities and contractures (shortening) of the soft tissue around the joints, like muscles and ligaments. Contractures tend to occur when the muscles around a joint are maintained in a shortened, flexed position. With RA, this sometimes happens because inflammation makes it impossible to straighten a joint completely or because it sometimes feels better to favor the limb or digit by keeping it flexed. They can also occur because of unequal growth of bones making up the joint; a common problem for children with JIA as they grow. Splinting and stretching programs (both passive and active) are important for preventing contractures or to keep them from getting worse. Once contractures have formed, splinting, stretching and other modalities can be used to try to lengthen the soft tissue again, but if those methods fail, then surgery may be required.
.Well, 21 actually. I just logged in and realised that it has been 3 weeks to the day since I last posted, and after reading through my last post, I hardly recognise it as me, and yet I remember writing it through tears. I can't believe how completely different I feel. I remember Seaneen saying once that if you feel suicidal try to ride it out for just one month - chances are, you would have changed your mind by then. It's so true. I'm not saying that I wanted to kill myself and that I've been waiting for a month to pass, I'm just saying that 3 weeks ago I would never have imagined I could feel as different as I do today. This is probably the best I have felt in at least 7 years. In fact, I'm in such a positive place right now that I'm scared of losing it or spoiling it in some way. For the first time since Mr Man's first admission into hospital, I'm at peace, and I want to stay at peace. For this reason I have decided that I won't be writing in my blog for the time being. Although I have struggled to update my blog regularly for quite some time now, I never thought I would stop writing it completely. But dwelling on past experiences has not allowed me to let go of the anger I have felt over certain events, and although I desperately wanted to share them with the world, I now feel that it's time to move on. Of course, never say never. This is perhaps a "See you later" rather than a "Goodbye". Thank you all for reading, and especially those who have taken the time to comment. The blog will remain and I hope that others will continue to benefit from it.
Hard work has a way of transforming us. In all my life, I've never met one obese person who got that way while eating sensibly and working hard. Gluttony and laziness were significant lifestyle factors, which the more candid and forthright ones readily admitted. I believe that God designed our bodies for hard work. Male bodies, especially, are designed for streneous physical labor. Those masculine muscles were put there for a purpose. What is sad to me is that too many men in our culture have become soft, indulgent, and lazy. Even worse, they are unashamed of this, and try to act as if it is the way that men should be. Some time back, I hard an overweight young guy criticize his girlfriend for putting on some weight. "Girls are supposed to be skinny," he said, "and guys are supposed to be big." Big being, of course, a polite way of saying overweight, flabby, and out of shape. I pointed out that, no, actually women were supposed to have a higher body fat percentage than men. It's one of the ways God designed us. Men were supposed to be relatively lean and muscled. Those that work hard enough and eat sensibly enough usually are.
My daughters were born and raised in coastal Florida, right up until we drove halfway across the country to move to Colorado in February 2009. They're both excellent swimmers even though they've never taken a lesson. Instead, they grew up in the Gulf of Mexico and in our backyard pool, where floating in a swim ring gave way to splashing around with arm floats gave way to the little kid's drowned-rat doggie paddle gave way to actual swimming and, in Kyra's case, diving.
I'm so keyed up right now, I'm fucking delirious. But not in a positive way. If I had a nickel for every time I've said the word "fuck" in the past six hours... I don't know, maybe it's just from a day of eating after a good two-day fast. I say "good" because although I didn't have any food, I must have had too many liquid calories (soymilk, fruit juice), because the weight didn't budge. For two solid days. Fuck. But, in order to be strong for the 3-day weekend fast, I decided to go ahead and eat today. That, and I had a mid-day job, and sure enough, as soon as I got there, they tried to feed me. But I had already set my mind to eat only healthy foods today, and as the shoot was short, I made enough excuses to get out of eating. What the hell? My call time was noon, and they ordered lunch to arrive RIGHT before I got there. Convenient? Coincidence? Or has someone figured me out? If I find out that one of my agents or managers is reading this blog, I swear to God I will shut it down or move it to another address. The moment I arrived at this shoot, all three -- the producer, director, and stylist -- immediately start insisting I should eat something, eat something, EAT SOMETHING. Fuck the hell off! It's enough to make me fucking paranoid!! For the first twenty minutes I was there, all I heard was "eat something." I'm like, "Where's the script? Would you like to see my wardrobe? What's the character's mode?" etc. No, none of that seemed to matter, just, "Eat something." I was so close to screaming! But I kept my cool, made some great excuses (thank you, C!!) and was able to avoid eating anything they offered me. I think the timing actually worked in my favor, because I was able to buckle down as soon as I arrived, and by the end of the shoot, they'd all forgotten that I hadn't eaten. (Oh and by the way, I was shooting a commercial playing a girl working out at a fitness center! Ha ha! So I got in a mini-workout in the middle of the day!) Then the drive home was fucking frustrating. I only had one shot of espresso early in the day, but the stress alone had me pulling my hair out all the way home. (No, not literally). And when I got home tonight, all keyed-up and ready to have a killer-fucking-workout, I get to the gym and the place is closed for a power outage. What the fuck!!!????!!! I'm so ludicrously charged up, and I've got no place to burn all these calories and stress!!! Well, I do have about a zillion things to take care of before midnight tonight, so I guess the good Lord's actually putting me where I need to be. But that means tomorrow's weight is gonna be way up, and I'm already dreading that. I already took one melatonin tonight to try to calm me down. Thank God tomorrow's audition is for someone who's "energetic and a fast-talker." Jeez, I wish I could do it right this very second, I'd win the part for sure. God, I can't wait to start this 3-day fast. I fucking need it like I need fucking air in my lungs. I'll probably start tomorrow
I've been reading Marya's book again. The last time I read it, it triggered me into a summer of long-term fasts (lost 20 pounds in 3 months), so I'm wondering what will happen to me now that "I've been rehabilitated." It's such a wonderful account of her journey. Those of you who've commented that you enjoy reading my stuff, I HIGHLY recommend you read this book. She's a fucking fantastic writer. She's a freakin' phenom, and I aspire to be her one day. I'm not in ana-mode right now. No. Not that I don't want to. I've been back out on my own for several months now, but I'm still not entirely sure that I'm not being watched. But I can see the ana creeping back in. I'm back to my daily routine-making, gaining control. I've been having a bowl of cereal for breakfast (300 cals), a salad for lunch (440 cals), and a latte for dinner (260 cals), followed by 8-10 miles at the gym (950 cals) every day for the past few weeks. Some days work has gotten in the way, and I've had to switch to have the latte for lunch and the salad for dinner. And weekends are way harder when I'm out with friends. But for the most part I've been able to stick to it. I'm not weighing myself. The scale is in the bathroom, and it's a struggle in my head every morning deciding whether to look or not. I don't want to know. I just know that I'm not even close to my all-time low weight, so I know I'll hate myself and relaspe for sure if I look. I'm scared to look. But I'm dying to know. I hate myself. A little bit of trauma in my life lately. Same boy who left me for "fat cow", then broke up with her in November just shortly after I got sent away, then tried to get back with me when I got out... hasn't talked to me for about 3 months. I was ok with that. Until last week when he randomly decided to call me up for dinner, only to let me know that he'd met another girl and he's going to marry her. (SFX bomb-drop) Not that I ever really expected to marry him, but shit. Who decides to marry someone after only 3 or 4 dates? Apparently he does. So yeah, that's been a little bit triggering. Had a helluva 11-mile run at the gym that night. But unfortunately that tipped me over the edge: I twisted my right hip and it's been aggravated since, keeping me from going to the gym the past 5 days. So trauma is just that much more... shitty. I hate this life. Why do I bother to persist?
I had severe CTS in both hands and it kept me enjoying gardening, even using a riding lawn mower so I had Carpal Tunnel Release surgery May 2008 on my left hand as I am right-handed and wanted to make sure the surgery on left was a success before I put my right hand through the surgery. My surgeon told me I would be "like new" and could again enjoy working outside, and able to do ANYTHING. I just want to mention something to the people who are thinking about having Carpal Tunnel surgery that I wish someone would have told me, primarily my surgeon. After surgery, the pain only got worse (over a 10 on pain scale) and I had not had any relief since the anesthetic wore off. Finally in July my surgeon said I have "RSD" aka Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. RSD is also known as CPRS Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and anyone considering having CTR surgery be aware. I have RSD/CRPS and after 1 year in physical therapy (3 x's a week)I have a 5 lb. weight restriction for life and my right hand is not operable for the severe CT still causing extreme pain. There is no cure for RSD/CRPS & it is a debilitating disease. I am no longer able to work because of the heavy pain meds I am on, and will be on for the rest of my life, not to mention everything I do exacerbates the RSD, daily tasks. If you would like more info regarding this disease that can happen to anyone go to www.rsdsa.org and you will get an idea of the hell it is to live with it. Please do some research before you agree to CTR surgery. I cannot do ANY yard work now. Any trauma causes the RSD to spread. RSD/CRPS aka Causalgia is the most painful type of chronic pain according to the McGill Pain Index today, even more painful than amputation and I live with this pain everyday. Good luck and I hope this never happens to anybody else!
You got to watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIwrV5e6fMY (It's 20 minutes long so get comfortable) And the accompanying article for more information about the award: http://www.tedprize.org/jamie-oliver/ Jamie Oliver is working to change children's lives by tackling school lunch. When he accepts the award he does a dramatic display with sugar. That's all I'm going to say about that. And then the clips of the families he is working with...wow. My favorite part is when he takes a bunch of different vegetables into the classroom and shows them to the students. He asks them to name each of them. A kid calls an eggplant "a pear." I'm going to try the that with my students sometime soon (this week if I find time to get to a grocery store). It's the Jamie Oliver Vegetable Experiment!
Here is the most shocking admonition of all: I prefer being the size I am right now. I have weighed more in the past, but I feel better at this weight -- and I actually think that I look better. So does my husband. (I don't carry my fat well. I'm not one of those women who "gains all over" and looks voluptuous. The more weight I gain, the more disproportionately pear-shaped I become.) So, yeah. I'm wearing skinny jeans. My size 6 pants are now too big for me. A lot of people think that is disgusting and would no doubt assume I have some sort of eating disorder or mental condition. I'm sure some moms would rather their daughters not read my blog -- and I may even lose some of those mothers as readers. But...if it's a wonderful thing to come out as "fat" or "plus-sized", why not as slim? Instead of asking, "Can I please be fat?" I'm asking, "Can I please be thin?" I'm certainly not expecting the sort of applause my plus-sized sister bloggers have received. All I'm asking for is a little "healthy weight for my frame acceptance" or even -- dare I say it? -- "thin acceptance".
His teacher told me that Adrian was “bright” and “caught on to things really quickly” two things that honestly, I thought I would never hear from a teacher about Adrian. His teacher is fabulous. I really wasn’t sure about her but now we’re so impressed and excited. She truly seems to really like Adrian, he cuddled with her when I was there and she smiled at him. She is very good at sticking with things and finding out exactly what works for Adrian no matter how long it takes. She used the word “excited” several times when describing how she felt about Adrian’s progess. Adrian is moving on to “normal” kindergarten math activities and working on some 1st grade writing stuff.
It was probably within the past two years that my husband came home from work and told me about one of his coworkers that stopped eating any foods with HFCS (high fructose corn syrup). I laughed and thought, "What a loon!" Fast-forward to having a child and breastfeeding my baby. I started to have to supplement with a little formula when he was around six months old. One day I was looking at the ingredients of the formula and I noticed that HFCS was right up there in the ingredient list. That broke my heart! As a mother, I just want my kid to get the best food possible with the least amount of cheap additives. And here my baby was so small and getting a lot of this corn product straight. Something felt wrong to me. What do you know about HFCS? Are we overreacting about how it might change students' classroom behavior?
reat post! Another disease with the heterozygote advantage is Cystic Fibrosis. It is a disease that infects the lungs, causing large amounts of sticky mucus to build up in the pancreas as well. In the lungs it can block airways and make it difficult to breathe. If the pancreas is infected the digestive track can be clogged and digestion stopped. Although people with cystic fibrosis have a shorter life expectancy than normal, as treatments improve the life expectancy is rising. Also the earlier you get treatment the longer you will live. Symptoms of cystic fibrosis is salty tasting skin, wheezing, coughing, and short breath, excessive appetite but little weight gain. You can be tested from a sweat test or prenatal screening, or newborn screening.
I've had Ulcerative Colitis for about 16 years, and I'm almost always in a flare up. I just starting using this website, which is wonderful! For the past week, I've been modifying my diet to include mostly anti-inflammatory foods, and I immediately started feeling an improvement. My constant bloating has diminished, and I'm anxious to see how this affects my health over the coming weeks and months. I wanted to know if there is a way to search ND to find foods within a range of IF ratings, for example -- be able to search for highly anti-inflammatory foods, or moderately anti-inflammatory foods. I can see the IF rating when I select a specific food, but it would be great if I could search for a list of foods based on IF rating. Thank you.
Yesterday and today, I viewed two different videos with poignantly beautiful messages. If I were to combine the themes of both together, it would be this: our Father God wants to tell each one of us, as He carries us through our personal storms, "I love you...we're going to make it...I know the way home...surrender...surrender and let me carry you...all will be well!" My friend Mike knew that. He would talk to me of surrender and brokenness...of his "Precious Saviour"...of grace...ah, grace!...and of glorious freedom, not just freedom FROM but freedom TO...and always he would hammer home truth, truth, truth...and how beautiful and wonderful that truth is! That's why, at the end of his life, Mike could be so calm and could even joke. He was that sure. As he had told me at least once, "I'm a nobody...but I know Somebody." And Mike knew -- he knew with every brain cell of his vast intellect and every fiber of his very being -- that it was grace, all grace. Salvation? All grace! Sanctification? All grace! Anything at all good in us? All grace! Our eternal hope? Grace upon grace! That is what Mike taught: grace, grace, grace. It is what he lived and breathed. It is what will be sung at his memorial service. It is grace that took Mike home, into the very arms of his Precious Saviour. I know that all is now well for the man who considered himself a big brother to a number of us. All is well...and someday all will be well for us too. Enjoy Jesus, Mike, enjoy Jesus. See you forever.
Jil's advice of the day: If you are Bipolar, do not drink 9 million Red Bulls in a day because you will go crazy and never sleep. I know this from experience and have learned from my dreadful mistake. It really gives you wings. 24 days no smoking. I rock! Not much else going on. My 10 year high school reunion is coming up. That should be interesting....especially since Ive gained about 50 lbs since high school (thank you Zyprexa)....and people I havent seen in a long time have no clue who I am. Nice. I am selling my motorcycle. Anyone want it? I really hate to, but I need a car....extremely bad. Man, I am tired...but no Red Bull for me!! I was watching the clock about every 5 minutes last night, paranoid that it was wrong and I'd miss work. Yes, I am quite strange. I drank 2 of the really big Red Bulls yesterday and God knows how many Mountain Dews....lets just say I was wound up!! Now I can hardly keep my eyes open because I didnt sleep :( OOOOHHHH WEEELLLLLL Thats it from me for the moment.
Doing good so far on the 3-day weekend fast. Nothing but water yesterday, and was down 2 lbs this morning. No food today, but did have several caloried drinks as well as my water. I'm anxious to see what I'll weigh tomorrow morning because of the calories... mostly soy milk, so I know the protein is what kept me strong enough to evade eating. But do the calories factor out? We'll see. I will admit, I did buy 2 butter croissants and an apple-cinnamon scone today to support my church's bake sale. And I bought them with the mindset of bingeing. But once I got back in the car, I reminded myself of you guys, and the promise I made to fast for three days. I didn't eat them. (I love you guys.) I can tell myself I'll only eat one bite, but the truth is that I can never stop myself. If I eat just a little bit, I end up tailspinning into a maniacal uncontrollable binge-fest. I think it's a survival-instinct thing... my body's been starving for a few days now, and it thinks that I have to LOAD UP on calories in case I don't feed it again for awhile. So to avoid the binge, I MUST avoid the first bite. I wrapped up the baked items and put them away to save for Monday. If I can save everything for "cheat days" (make them Monday and Thursday) and then fast five days a week, hopefully the starving will outweigh the binges. God, I wish I could just stop bingeing altogether. One day at a time. I feel strong that I will be able to get through tomorrow without eating again. I'll probably have another soy latte, 1) because I need the caffeine to keep my energy up, 2) the protein in the soy was a miracle filler. But if tomorrow's weigh-in doesn't look like I'll lose all five by tomorrow night, maybe no soy latte...
Milk has been there my whole life. I loved the stuff and drank it everyday. But like many folks in my family as I have gotten older it's gotten harder for me to digest milk products. This project has revealed to me that I'm lactose-intolerant. Just to make my life easier I'm cutting out straight milk and ice cream (dairy products with the most lactose). Lact*aid products although great just seem like too much fooling around for me with my busy schedule. I can't imagine removing dairy completely from my life since I love yogurt (and luckily it is low in lactose). Milk is a staple of school lunches. Kids really do love it (I know my toddler does). I think the debate about milk that I've seen online is that students should only be served skim milk because it is low in fat and that it does not contain high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) like chocolate milk. I am concerned about HFCS and how it influences children's behavior, but I don't have a lot of information about it. I also think it's possible that students who don't get good fats (vegetable oils) in their diet could benefit from milk fat instead of trans fat.
At the next park day, the more experienced moms in our group laughed at my tale. They had been there. They had learned to share mostly the sanitized version of motherhood with their husbands, and to come up with a canned, pleasant answer to "What on earth did you do all day?!" As one mom told me, "Marriage shouldn't be a contest about who had the most stressful day. Let your husband win that one. He will be happier thinking that he is creating a wonderful life for you through his noble sacrifice. He doesn't need your stress on top of his." Once in a while, I listen to Dr. Laura on the radio while I'm running errands. One of her recurring themes is to remind women that they are married to men, and not to their girlfriends. Hours of talking? Deep sharing? Feelings? The daily minutiae of life? Save it for your girlfriends. Your husband will never be interested in that!
I am a thirty-something wife, stay-at-home mom, school volunteer, community group leader, writer, scrapbooker, jewelry designer. Oh yeah, and I have this chronic, painful disease called rheumatoid arthritis that tries to take all that away from me. This journal is all about me trying to keep it all together while still living a normal life. (Plus bonus literary quotes! What's a former English major going to do without her quotes?)
After a very stressful few weeks, and a very naughty weekend, I am feeling quite... (how shall we say) unqualified to fit into my skinny jeans this week. So, now that I feel like a lot of the heat has let off, it's time for a good old-fashioned FAST. Just a little one, to see if anyone notices. It's 6 pm here on the east coast, and I have a party to go to tonight, followed by 2 auditions tomorrow, and another party tomorrow night. Evenings are usually my gym-time, so without an outlet for my persistent anxiety, I feel like I'd rather control my food intake if I can't get a grip on my energy output. To keep eyebrows from raising, I'm going to try to keep pushing the fluids, keeping a drink of some kind with me at all times, to give an illusion of intake. However, I will try to keep these calorie counts down as well. Mostly water, maybe a little bit of VitaminWater, a sip or two of soymilk for breakfast, and coke zero if I MUST have caffeination. But no food. Until at least midnight tomorrow (Monday night). I'm already anticipating the high!! And looking forward to telling ya'll how it went. God, I hope I get away with this. Depending on how it goes, who knows what I might do after this? Who's fasting with me? 30 hours food-free! Let's do it! Think beautiful thoughts, girls! XOXO!
Today's menu: cheese lasagna, peas, pear, milk, bread, butter Wow. Truly monumentally bad. I couldn't get through the main entree. I was hungry too... I bit the cheese lasagna and it didn't even pass muster as pasta! Al dente? No, al crappy. The pasta couldn't hold its form and it crumbled. I ate two bites and I was done. Yuck. Luckily I keep peanut butter in my desk. I used the two pieces of bread that came with the lunch and made a peanut butter sandwich. The spork was my snife. I would have been so screwed without my little snack stash today. The pear and the peas were good. If it had been a fruit cup, I probably would have cried.

I havent written in a while and just gave this link to a friend and realized how long it's been since I've posted something on here. I love to write but sometimes I get tired of talking about my illness, you know the cheesy line, "I have Achalasia but Achalsia doesn't have me" well, sometimes it takes over and I get overwhelmed with the drama of it, which now that I think of it, is somewhat selfish, at least blogwise. I have new readers and haven't kept up with what I've learned about the disorder or what's new about it. Im going to do some research tonight. I don't want my fellow achalasia suffers to feel alone and I don't want to feel like I am the only one in the world with this disorder
Today's menu: cheeseburger, corn, peach fruit cup, popcorn chips, milk I'm feeling so yellow after this meal. Can you get over how everything is the same color? And then there's two corn-based sides... I love popcorn. It started because of my Grandma, who was a popcorn fanatic and ate it whenever she watched a movie. I'm not referring to movie theater popcorn, but popped on the stove, drizzled with real melted butter, and consumed while enjoying an old movie in her den. Good food is all about memories and family, no? I'm trying to figure out why the popcorn had to be made into crisps?! Popcorn is good without being further processed! The last picture is a look inside the package at this strange food. It didn't taste like popcorn to me.
I'm 35 and was recently diagnosed with RA (although I tried to convince the rheumatologist otherwise!). For several years I dismissed all the symptoms as nothing more than the stress of being a recently divorced single mother, trying to make ends meet as an administrative assistant by day and a piano instructor in my home studio by night (my own super-hero identity in the making?). Not once did I think my poor health was due to anything other than sheer exhaustion and stress. So when the rheumatologist confirmed what my family doctor speculated, I was in shock. I went into denial. I tried to convince myself that I could be healthy if I just tried harder to manage the stress better and stuck to a strict diet/exercise plan. In fact, I think I still am in denial at times: I'm struggling, stubborn, and stupefied. I agree with others that a diagnosis of RA causes feelings of isolation due to the general population's lack of knowledge about it (myself formerly included). I've always 'burned the candle at both ends' to take care of myself and my family, and admitting to myself that I cannot physically do something was/is very upsetting. But reading your blog and the interactions with others with RA has helped immensely. I've laughed a lot, and laughter is the best medicine of all, right? And now I have all the more reason to finally purchase a grand piano before the age of 40….it's going to happen, and I'm going to play Chopin on it beautifully, with all my students on stage with me, and my two wonderful children at my side. Thank you, and best wishes.
If you allow yourself to be open to the struggles of humanity, it can sometimes be difficult to remain hopeful and positive. I try to educate myself on what is going on in the world. I try to remember that as I type away, in the comfort of my sitting room, with my A/C and chai latte, there are many things simultaneously occurring that are unfathomable and devastating. I try to remind myself daily of how blessed I am. I'm pretty good at remaining grateful. I can look at my family, friends and animals, and know that they are all a reflection of what is good in life. It might seem weird that I'm starting a post about the All-Star Game with the above paragraph, but honestly, my experience at the All-Star Game always invokes a feeling of gratitude. It is a reminder that, not only am I blessed to be given the opportunities bestowed upon me, but also that I am blessed to have been born into this country. Baseball is an escape for me. I get lost in it. Baseball is the coming together of unlike minds for a like purpose. Every moment before a pitch is thrown has its own pulse. Looking at a field and seeing all the greats in the game, in all their shapes and sizes--their different cultural backgrounds, history and cellular make up--is a reminder that anyone, from anywhere, can play the game of baseball. You don't have to be seven feet tall or seven feet wide. It is the Everyman's sport. Regardless of any controversy that surrounds baseball, this is what I think of when I look at all the greats on one field. I had a beautiful time in St. Louis. On Sunday, I did an autograph session at the stadium, where I got to meet some awesome people.
I had Adrian's IEP meeting yesterday morning. They are always hard for me and I try to just walk away from it without crying, I didn't cry yesterday but it was very close. Present at the meeting was Adrian's teacher, speech pathologist, school counselor, a representative from the area education agency, and school principal. First they just went through everything from when he first started receiving services from the AEA until present day. We talked about his progress and whether or not he is still eligible for special education services, summer school, and door to door bus pickup. He's still eligible for all of those services. Next the school counselor brought out the Conner scale that myself and his teacher had filled out. He is rated “high” on many areas that would indicate ADHD but the counselor said you can't be sure whether or not some of those high ratings are from the autism or ADHD. She just said it's up to me, I can take this to the doctor and have him evaluated, it's just our choice how to proceed. I will take the charts to his doctor either next time we go or I'll make an appointment in the next month or so, I haven't decided yet because I think we're going to have to get a referral and go out of town to have him evaluated for ADHD. Next I talked to the speech pathologist. She just gave her report and is really impressed with how well he started to come along because apparently they had a rough start. Then his teacher discussed his goals, I think I'll write up a separate post about his actual goals because this will get too long. The only thing I was kind of surprised about was that the AEA rep was talking about how we need to make sure Adrian's goals will help him function in his life. For example, rather than teaching Adrian his days of the week we should be teaching him things like telling the difference between a men's restroom and a ladies restroom or that you should stop at a stop sign to be safe. It kind of turned into a thing where we were discussing whether or not he should be taught to read right now or not. I want Adrian to read, I think he's capable and he loves letters. The question is will he just memorize the words or will he really understand the meaning behind the words? I just didn't know what to say or think, I guess I wasn't prepared for that. I just assumed that the next step, since he knows all his letters and the sounds, that he would start to learn to read. Eventually we came to an agreement that the would add an extra goal, one for learning his sight words AND one for learning more functional skills. Basically it boils down to I want him to HAVE IT ALL! It was also a big joke that Adrian REALLY likes girls. He cuddles up next to girls, he approaches girls in the hallway, he tries to cuddle with all the female teachers. His teacher made the comment that they were having some college girls coming in to help in that classroom and that Adrian “was going to just love that!” They were all talking about how lovable he is and even when he's having a rough day it makes it so much easier because he's such a loving and sweet boy. Music to my ears. When I receive the actual IEP in paper I will post his goals. I wish I would have done more research on what I wanted his goals to be before I went so maybe our goals can help someone in the future. They had to make some changes to the IEP so I didn't get a copy yet.
I have a few friends that question whether or not true and deep intimacy is possible between members of the opposite sex, even husbands and wives. Oh, sure, husbands and wives can share closeness, friendship, a strong emotional bond --- but can they be as intimate as two women friends? As vulnerable with one another? As understanding? As capable of sharing thoughts and feelings? As emotionally close? As willing to share the bad, as well as the good? When I was a new mother, I craved friendship with other mothers, and I enjoyed a level of intimacy with women that I'd never experienced before. It was a deep fellowship, a sharing of this overwhelming new adventure that had completely captured us. It was to my friends that I was able to admit a few "dark nights of the soul". At one point, I felt that maybe it was wrong for my fairly new friends to know me, the real me, so much better than my husband did, so I attempted to let him know how profound the experience of motherhood was for me. Unfortunately, we both ended up frustrated. He simply couldn't handle the fact that I was not only and always happy about every aspect of motherhood. He didn't want to hear about sleep deprivation, about the numbing mindlessness of many days, about changing two dozen diapers in just 24 hours. He also didn't want to hear that I sometimes went in just to see my sleeping baby (during those rare moments when he slept) and wept with joy at his beauty. He strongly suggested I needed more time with my women friends. He also wondered if my reaction to motherhood was normal. To him, it was all wacky and disturbing. Couldn't life just return to normal?
 Today's menu: peanut butter and jelly graham cracker sandwich, apple juice, fruit cup (peaches), milk I could barely eat this meal so I didn't. And then I was deliriously ravenous driving to get my little one. And then it got worse. I got sick when I got home. I can't say what exactly did it. Whether it was the lunch (I ate only half of one sandwich) or the not eating enough (also family history of vertigo) or taking a vitamin towards the end of the day without much in my stomach or just plain getting sick.... I feel better now. I probably didn't eat enough. You know, I think I'm going to pack a lunch for tomorrow. In general I don't look at the lunch menu for a extra "surprise," but I can't do it after this night in the bathroom. I can't make my husband do all the work two nights in a row. Until I feel better I'm doing the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) and I'm sure none of those foods are on the menu. I noticed a LOT of kids with packed lunches today. Maybe they knew something I didn't. *** Earlier in the day I asked the kids what they thought of the lunch. Some ate it and said they thought it was "good." A couple kids did not eat it. Tons of packed lunches though. Maybe 20%? Trust me, that's a lot. I asked a couple kids if they ate the peaches and they looked at me strangely and said, "no." I don't think they even opened the packages. *** I took a photo of the nutritional facts. Each sandwich was 318 calories. Because the other food items haven't listed the calories, I never knew. Looking at the calories made it hard for me to choke this one down.
I'd like to have a comprehensive list of links on the side of the blog so that people interested in school lunches, nutrition, food politics, food journalism, food service, foodies, mommy meal planners, school gardeners, school lunch companies, etc. But I don't have time to hunt each of you down and figure out your blog URL, etc. If you want to have a link in a new list to the side of the blog, please comment below with your blog's name, URL and how it might possibly relate to the discussion we have as a community around school lunches. I'll add and update the link list slowly over time (you know, when I get some!) Thanks!
