Winter Beauty Tips:
Potatoes have so many uses!  Slice raw potatoes and put them on your eye lids to reduce puffiness.  Or cure swollen feet with a mashed potato foot soak!  Just purchase a box of dehydrated mashed potatoes and followed the recipe. Once you have your mashed potatoes add lukewarm or cool water to get the temperature to the right level to soak your feet.  The potatoes will retain heat longer than a traditional foot bath and they help reduce swelling and soften skin.  To make it special add essential oils before you put your feet in. Then indulge feet into one of the best soaks you’ll ever experience!   (It’s perfect for making use of those leftovers…)  This same concept can be used with Oatmeal.  Oatmeal will be soothing and deeply restorative to dry cracked and painful feet.
 
Exfoliate:  In the winter, the most important thing to do to keep skin remaining healthy is to exfoliate twice per week to remove dead skin cells.  Central heating plays havoc on the sebum our skin normally produces, which makes our skin lose water which should be retained in the lower dermis of the skin.  During the winter months there are thousands of dry skin cells ready to be sloughed off the surface and they become clumped together with oil which forms what appear to be flakes. Don’t be flaky, exfoliate! Exfoliate your facial skin with crème based exfoliates with jojoba beads.  You can exfoliate your body with a butter, oil, or crème scrub that uses salts or sugars.
 
Hydrotherapy:  For a simple in home hydrotherapy, start out your day with a hot steamy shower and just as you are finishing switch the water to cold for about fifteen seconds. Repeat the process for two minutes. This hydrotherapy technique will revitalize your skin by stimulating the flow of blood through the skin.
