Feels like a monthly blog!

It dawns on me that it was just about a month ago that I updated this thing! Being in a musical melodrama in addition to work just about did me in! So, the thoughts for today:

To have someone change their behavior, the person must THINK differently. This was an idea I heard of about 8 years ago when I listened to Dennis Sparks (National Staff Development Council) speak to the MAS/FPS board during one of our summer retreats. I never forgot his ideas. One of our assignments was to read an online book: "Designing Effective Professional Development," and the ideas hit home then, and they hit home now.

So why haven't things changed?

I guess I've changed. I've changed jobs (school districts) twice since then, and each time I entered into these new cultures, I first had to assimilate myself into this new ground, before I could start to embark on any change. That is the hardest thing for me right now. Being in my new district merely 6 months, but having ideas that could potentially be employed in an instant, yet knowing that IMPOSING those ideas will not create real change is frustrating. 

People need to THINK differently. The training that I'm attending during these first two school days in Februrary and two days in March involves increasing skills in "Coaching for Results." The idea is to use conversations to stimulate thinking, and to effect change. This kind of thinking is a type that elicits emotion, and allows connections to be made. From this intense emotional change comes change. 
And it ain't easy, and it isn't timely. But it lasts...and therefore it is important.
