here goes my testimonial for viveki know this guy for the past 8 yrs and still remember the first day wen he joined 11th in our schoolhe is very friendly,helpful and a cool guy who takes things in a sportive manner and a good friend to be with...he is very good at french and german, he was our unofficial french teacher at schoolcant forget those days wen v used to go to his house saying v r gng to learn frenchand instead we used to play cricket inside his house ,his house was almost like a guest house for us where we get snacks and tea  always, we have spent more time talking to each other while playing in the ground rather than in school..those are memorable days and he is one of the few school frnds with whom i still have regular touch...hope we remain in contact till the end ... wishing him all the very best for his future career
