Its like yesterday, but I can still remember the day i first met you.It was August 19,2005 around noon.We were all gathered for the first year's orientation day.At first sight itself you waved at me like a very old friend and introduced yourself to me and i was amazed.This is how it all started. I never thought i would be really this close to you as you had many friends in college. But you took the initiative and made sure that I was comfortable with you.
Sumi can read your mind just like that. A very true and a loyal friend to have. She is unpredictable at certain times. Dont try to mess up with her feelings. Just accept the way she is and you will be really surprised to see a very different person altogether. She can be silly and intelligent at the same time. I wonder how she can watch a movie all night and still manages an 80 in the next day's test. She makes a boring class very lively by her constant doubts.
Hey SUMI you are the best i have ever had.I will do my best to make you feel the same way!..
