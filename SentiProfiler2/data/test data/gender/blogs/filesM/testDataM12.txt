Hello, Peeps! Thanks for visiting my blog. It's a place that allows me to share all the cool creative people and their creations I come across in this world. And, a place to showcase some of my work. I'm a designer, and I believe that if you can dream it you can do it. I apply that very basic belief to every aspect of my life and work. After my family, my greatest passion is to design and create things that are new, unique, and on the edge. Creativity and inspiration are all around us everyday. Anyone can recognize when something is beautiful, the secret is to take the time and learn why it is.
As I write at 10am, it is 26 degrees.  The low last night was around 20, the worst of a series of overnight freezes here in Central Texas since December and on the way to becoming the coldest winter on record.  

Last summer was the hottest on record.

It leaves me wondering if whatever is going on with the climate isn't so much global warming (although overall, it is) as extreme fluctuations, like a swing with a bonfire on one side and an iceberg on the other.
If so, how far each way will it go?

Maybe it's just a coincidence.
I just finished a video project on Utah after 9/11 for the paper. It was coupled with a small portrait series. I was very impressed with those I interviewed. From the General of the Utah National Guard to a married couple who were blocks from the Twin Towers when they were attacked, to parents of fallen soldiers, they all spoke so open and candidly with me. 
I naturally thought how my life has changed since 9/11. When I was a kid I was interested in the decade of the 60s. From what I saw and read, it seemed like so much changed so quickly, and the things that did change were monumental. 
I wonder what will be said about the last decade. I remember the morning of the attacks, it was my first semester at community college, and I remember the year following; the patriotism, the national reverence at all the memorials. I feel like it was an interesting time to be a college freshman. It all came to a point when almost exactly a year after the attacks I was moving back to Germany for two years for church service. It was a month or so after the US Congress had authorized the military to go into Iraq. The stewardess handed me a copy of the Frankfurter Allegemeine newspaper and the front page photo was a giant protest against the US going to war. I remember looking at that photo and realizing that I was entering a very different sea of opinions than post 9/11 America. 
7-8 years later I am still wrestling with my opinions on the war(s) etc. I feel myself pulled to the moderate center, but then I feel like I use those words to dress up fence sitting. It is funny how since 9/11, the more I hear the resolute opinions of others, the less I want to have my own.
Hey.  Things are going great down here in alabama.  it is really hot though.  i hate to say it but i miss maine's weather.   Especially when it comes time to do pt every day.  congrads on the job in new York.  Do you like it there?  I hope everything is going good for you.  Are you going to be able to go home for Christmas?  I'm planning on going home for a week or two. It was really nice seeing my mom and erin for my graduation.  I just wish I could of spent more than one day with them. Well i have to get going but take care and it was nice hearing from you.
I'm so tired of myself... 
I'm so tired of being in love... 
I'm so tired of wanting to be in love... 
I'm so tired of always being alone... 
I'm so tired of not having someone to talk to... 
I'm so tired of not having someone to show how much I love them... 
I'm so tired of not having someone show how much they love me... 
I'm so tired that I don’t have someone to hold onto... 
I'm so tired that I have no one to lie to 
and tell them I'm cold just so I could cuddle with them... 
I'm so tired of having no one to kiss over and over again...
I love me my Star Wars.

No, seriously. My first memory is of watching Return of the Jedi. Even though I felt deeply nonplussed by Killer Klones and Revenge of the Mediocre, I am still George Lucas’s bitch. I’ve bought the VHS, the DVD. I have Action Figures. Mini-Lego Sets. I ran a goddamn Star Wars D20 game.

I would not be surprised that my individual contribution probably paid for Jett’s braces.

So a few years ago Republic Commando comes out for the PC and Xbox. It gets good reviews, but I hold off, waiting for a price drop. It hits the bargain rack, but I have a huge backlog… and I’ll be back in Walmart next week.

There’s always another time.

Well, oops. Republic Commando left the bargain rack, and I figured that the game had passed me by. Then along comes Steam and its fiendish Holiday Sale (the number one reason why posters in the GESC will never finish that novel, that iPhone app, or rake that layer of leaves resting on the lawn). 5 bucks! Hot damn! Five bucks!

Click. Sold.

Having just gotten done with Batman: Arkham Asylum, I wanted something quick and zippy. Republic Commando fit the bill. Let’s see how well it stands the test of time.

At first, I was seriously meh. I had just finished Arkham Asylum, a gaming equivalent of The Dark Knight. You know why it’s been roundly praised as 2009’s Game of the Year? You’re the GODDAMN BATMAN! No, seriously. It’s the closest thing you’ll get to being an unhinged badass vigilante mofo with impeccable controls and incredible design.

And then along comes Republic Commando, a very decent licensed squad-based shooter. It felt like weak sauce. Decent is good. Would that more games were decent. After 2009’s GOTY, decent just felt… decent.

The first third of Republic Commando feels like a well-done generic squad shooter. Simple commands? Check. Weapons? Standard fare. License? Effective. Levels? Acceptable. Controls? Floaty. I spent most of the time feeling like I was piloting an underpowered floating turret. My assault rifle… just didn’t do much assaulting. Hell, I used my pistol as my go-to weapon – at least I wasn’t wasting ammo. On top of that, the level design just felt bland. I turned to my girlfriend and told her that it was just a bit of a bore.

Did I just waste five bucks?

The next night, I tackled the Assault Ship campaign, and suddenly things started getting better. Sure there was some copy/paste level design with ship corridors, but overall, I felt far more immersed in the game. Blasting flying bugs in a brown landscape? Been there, done that. Crawling through the guts of a “star destroyer” (Republic Assault Ship. I know. There’s a difference.), checking corners, breaching doors, and rescuing downed comrades? Hell yeah! That’s what Genndy Tartakovsky is all about.

Last night, I decided to put this baby to bed. The Kashyyyk campaign finally felt like a full-on Star Wars experience. You finally had decent weapons, your squad seemed to have stepped up its game, and the environments and levels stopped feeling generic. More than that, they got the final battles “right.” In fact, there wasn’t a final battle, per se. You traversed a collection of skirmishes with your team doing door breaches so that you could take down a Separatist Cruiser with cannon fire. Like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, there is no final boss, just a final level that tests your skills. When that cruiser came down, it was the exclamation point at the end of a satisfying endurance test.

I was immensely impressed. Most games peter out by the end. Republic Commando just kept getting better. That said, the game did have a number of flaws.

First: the base weapons suck. I rarely felt like I had a weapon in my hand. It wasn’t until the second campaign where you get the shotgun and the repeater that you actually feel you can open up a can of whoopass. Once the shotty became available, I only used the assault rifle against droids or when I ran out of ammo. 

What are we supposed to use? Harsh language?

Also, the graphics are dated. Duh. But still, there were some character models that were embarrassingly low-poly. Wookiees? They looked like they were rendered in the Dark Engine. The environments? Cohesive but unimpressive textures. Your squad looked great (thankfully), but you can definitely tell that the game has not aged as gracefully as it could have. It did, however, run nicely on a bootcamped Macbook White on Max Settings.

Also, you can definitely tell that the levels were designed for the Xbox. Yup. Loading screen. Loading Screen. Walk to the next building. Loading Screen. Oh! Hi! Alex Denton! I’m a big fan! Loading screen…

On the whole, though, Republic Commando is worth five bucks. Indeed, it’s worth ten. Is it worth the 50 bucks it was at launch? No. But if you’re a Star Wars fan who wants to drop a ten-spot and hit the wayback machine, take a look.
Two people stood in the busy street, the hustling thunder of the traffic an ostinato to their symphony of conversation. "you look well" he said with the awkwardness of memories lying on his tongue, as thick and sweet and decadently shaming as honey, and everything seemed to click back into place, just like two summers and 900 kisses ago.
"thank you" she said, and the love they felt for each other trailed behind them like scarves in the wind, twisting up into the sky above them and trailing around the tenements and apartment buildings, buzzing with life and electricity, intertwined and indivisible.  All around them the traffic danced and the peopled buzzed forward and they just talked. And it was like all there was about them was a field, and a beacon and the grey sky above, telling them to long for the ground, and each other and their lips and kisses and-
His phone rings, she jumps and the spell is broken, the strings of violins snap, the conductor gasps.
The symphony is silent and as they realise what they have been dreaming, and how dangerously close they came to connecting, he answers the phone and the signals of reality and boredom seep back in. A hand goes up, an absent-minded "bye" and he hurries away.
She stands in the street alone and begins to wrap up the tangles of her scarf, winding back the kite. A tear falls, or is it a raindrop. In the flood of a city, who can notice the difference?
It was 63° today and the snow has finally melted off most of the sidewalks. So I made it over to Starbucks and had tea this afternoon. It was so nice getting out of the house and enjoying the warmer weather. Maybe winter is finally over, after all it's almost St. Patrick's Day! I could sure go for a Guinness or two about now.

The mayor of Pittsburgh has declared a state of emergency in advance of flooding. Hopefully people are prepared, Especially those in flood prone areas. The weather forecast is expecting rain the next few days on top of melting snows in the higher elevations.....

The last few weeks I have been using my Netflix account to watch a ton of movies... plus the on-demand cable. Now that the weather is getting nicer I plan on being outside more as soon as the 1 foot of snow and ice melt off of my back deck....
I attended the sold-out Muse concert at the GMU-Patriot Center a few weeks back, and they give a fantastic live show. Now, this is a blog about film, so discussing a live concert may seem a little strange. But Muse uses a very impressive sound and light show, including showing sci-fi style video clips. I could include a link to a clip of a live performance here, but instead I've got something better. As long as we're on the topic of short film, here is Muse's music video for their song "Knights of Cydonia". It's a silent kung-fu/space-western set to the song. Check it out:

Lady Gaga: Auteur
I spent the day watching Lady Gaga videos on Youtube (It's spring break, okay?). After watching "Paparazzi" for the fifth time or so I began to dig into past SFFS events/meetings, and I realized that Lady Gaga has come up many many times in our various activities.

Why is this?

I'm not sure whether or not to chalk it up to pure coincidence, or whether to dig deeper into the Lady's prevalence in SFFS activities. Let me give a brief outline of what I'm talking about.

At one of our meetings, when trying to fix a technical problem on the projector, I put on the video "Bad Romance." I knew that the video started off with sound, and since our problem was an audio one, I figured it'd be a useful video to use. After we fixed the problem, we watched David Lynch's "The Alphabet," a short film that I described afterward as a sort of "moving canvas." What was even more telling than this was when member Justin Cousson, about thirty-seconds into the short, said something along the lines of, "Is this another Lady Gaga video?" I laughed at the time, but, now that I'm thinking about it, the aesthetic of the "Bad Romance" video is very Lynchian, which is to say, it's very Kubrickian. For a visual explanation of what I mean, see the following screencap:
Last year I made my New Year’s resolutions public on my blog. That seemed to help me complete a good handful of them (final score here). So I am going to have another go at it…

Big Stuff

Finish my pilots licence. It is just getting embarrassing at this point. 
Keep up the vacation plan and take at least 2 vacation that are more than 3 days. Hey people die at my age, got to get with it. 
At least 6 date nights with my wife. This would be more than the sum of all dates in the last 10 years (guess how old the oldest is) so this is a very aggressive goal. 
Go sailing at least 3 times (have not been since I was a kid). 
Get my wife to go sailing at least once (if I pull this one off I need a medal). 
Read at least one book that is not fiction, self help or business related. Not exactly what is left to read but there must be something out there. 
Maintain my weight (unless of course I am exposed to some freak nuclear activity that turns me into a ripped super hero overnight, in which case I will let this one go). 
Have neighbors and friends over for dinner. Small groups 1-2 couples. It is easier to dig up the dirt that way. 
Go at least once to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Hopefully the rest of the family will come too. 
The Little List

Now that I have found my foil and my kids are starting to express an interest I will bring this back to the list. Based on last years performance I am probably just being silly. 
2010 is the 20 year high school mark for both my wife and myself. Hoping we actually go so we laugh our asses off. 
Become proficient at tying my turban. There really is no reason as I could never wear it outside of the house, but man it feels great. No joke, can’t explain it but it just feels great. Help mental focus, I swear. 
Own and wear more hats. I love hats, why are they so out of fashion. 
Golf at least once. 
Make an effort to get technically better at taking photos now that I have a camera that can support it. Technically better means not having to take 200 photos to get lucky on 10. 
Take kids again on a train ride up to LA and explore. Hmmm boa and boba, sounds good right now. 
Drink more scotch (hey, I put it on the little list) 
Looking at this list it feels a little like a bucket list.
It was a beautiful sunset landing in Las Vegas last night, and today was a crazy good first day at the show! The fashion peeps are some of the coolest on the planet. Boundless creativity and vision. I was loving every minute of it...despite my sore feet! I would love to know how many miles I walked. It was a whole lot, but worth every step! 
Out of respect for the designers, I didn't take any close ups of the new products, but I did manage to snap a few shots to give you a little of the atmosphere.
This company makes their socks with bamboo...yes you read that right...bamboo! And, you would not believe how soft and wonderful they are! So cool...so GREEN...so awesome!

There was SO MUCH more, but I was so focused on the next rad piece around each corner, I just couldn't stop to take more photos. But, I will leave you with a very cool video I took at the end of the day in STREET
Have a great day eveyone! I'm off to start day 2! :-)
Nasty
under the skin, we meet and see our self's in the mirror our images
superimposed, ready or not I peer into your soul and dive deep splash
landing in a pool of pain As salty and familiar as the tears that run
down my cheek your eyes don't like what I see You don't want to be me,
pain is what I see, Am sorry that I couldn't be there. So you curse at
me and smash the mirror, scream and beg for it to stop so now What do
you get, in the hands of despair just splinters of glass, and tears of
regret, Now look again and tell me what you see, a monster Is what I
plea.
All right. So, here we go. The first parody of many to come. Please let me know what you think. Also, I will post a link to a youtube video of the original song so you may get the full experience of mine...ya know, if you play it while reading mine.

This was the very first parody that I made and wrote down to remember. For a long time in my life, I had been making up parodies to myself - just silly little changes to the songs - and they amused me. But if I ever tried to tell someone about it, I couldn't remember what I said. So, I promised myself that I would start writing down my parodies, and this was the next one to come.
Bailey is a cat. But not just any cat. He is a seventeen pound cat belonging to my fiancé. For those of you not familiar with pet weights, seventeen is freaking huge for a cat. You can't really blame my fiancé's family though. They found the cat as a stray and apparently wanted it to eat it's fill.
Anyway, I had the song Lady by Styx stuck in my head all day as I cut my fiancé's grass. I took a shower after I was done and when I walked out of the shower, there was Bailey sleeping soundly. I started singing Lady, but replaced Lady with Bailey. Upon hearing his name, he opened one eye and glared at me for waking him up. I then made up the second verse then and there. The rest of the song I made up later.
Enjoy!
Observation. I love to watch. Unlike the scene in "Being There", this has nothing to do with Peter Sellers and Shirley Maclaine. More importantly, it involves not just watching, but understanding the world around us. I have a point of view and I express it here.
Mind keep chewing old thoughts, random memories..turning the essence like juice savored slowly swirled around the tongue…some fragments stay stuck in crevices between teeth…lips smile at the taste of the memory…living in a tiny body perched on a tiny planet rotating/revolving in a set path in a universe that is moving in a hurry somewhere at breakneck speed….the mind gets disoriented…too many things flash by through the window to the eternal space….even though there is stillness around…..we live stacked upon each other and feelings and thoughts struggle in the crowd to breathe, suddenly there comes a break as when the train rushes suddenly through a country side…we breathe fresh air….like caressing strands of old music drifting aimlessly with the breeze, like an unanticipated unadulterated kiss in the middle of a mundane-any-other-day, like the fleeting smile on the lips of a sleeping puppy ...the stink becomes just a memory for a few seconds….and eyes begin to sparkle looking ahead…making soft dreams out of all that is left and all that is gathered new.
Academic: I seek to foster a research environment and culture at an undergraduate level, knowing that good undergraduate students make good graduate candidates. I wish to instill in the younger generation the desire to produce quality results that are cutting edge in their field of work.Personal: I am interested in fostering a healthy non-academic environment in which students can participate. A healthy dormitory life can be just as important as the availability of a quality education to the overall outcome of a student. I enjoy the non-academic activities available for student interaction and growth.I enjoy reading and constantly exploring new ideas and technologies from all different fields. More often than not I have been inspired by knowledge of advances in ancillary fields when attempting to solve problems in my own.Taught my first course in the Fall Qtr. 2006, undergraduate Transport Phenomena. The following spring I taught my first graduate course, Graduate Transport Phenomena, then in Fall 2007 I taught Biomechanics, Winter 2007 I helped to teach Senior Design Laboratory for engineers. This last year I assisted for most of those classes again. I have found what I love to do.Have been involved in research since 2001, and look forward to a lifelong involvement in academia. I doubt I will head back to an industry-life, but life has taught me that I can never predict exactly where it will take me
The dinner plates began to go cold. Some would say eat while you can. Others would say as long as you can is all that matters. The masters of the world know that the key to life is in their hands. So, they pull the strings and manipulate. Because, they know you'll jump through hoops to get what they have.

The game of life used to be survival. And now, the game of life is slavery. Ha. They say life is unfair. Well, why do you think that is?

Give me more Britney Spears. Give me more MTV and TMZ. Tune me into your programs. My brain is still unclean. It needs more washing. Whatta' ya' say, Uncle Sam?

Whatta' ya' say Obama? Ha. I'm being puppeteered by the puppet.

You win America. We are your slaves. Now hand me that big check that isn't quite big enough and dangle the food above me.

Just don't get comfortable. Karma will come to collect. Lololololololololzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Fruits.
There are some people in this world who are given the possibility to realize their dreams. Only problem is, that these opportunities are place on their lap, but they either don't have the knowhow, persistence or maybe just get bored with the situation at hand and then, they simply don't see it through. I knew such a man...

This man I once knew was pretty resourceful. Ever since he was young he had this dream to travel the world. So, he looked for a career that would offer him that ticket. He liked music, opera in particular. He sang alright, but he soon realizes it would never gain him international acclaim. Knowing that singing was not going to fulfill that dream of his, he found a way to gather what money he could and traveled to a distant land.

Truth of the matter was, that this man was driven. He had his goals in mind and he was determined one way or another to get where he wanted. What he had going for him was that he was hard working, but that card playing risk taker of life always shadowed him. Yes, he gambled alright. But, it was strictly on life. Other people saw these qualities in him and he rose quickly in the ranks of the corporate world. And as destiny would have it, it allowed him the opportunity to fulfill his dream of traveling. In his travels he met all types of characters of the world of finance and trade. All of which suited him fine. Since these characters were now fulfilling his sense of adventure.
I wanted to write a thing about this picture here since November last year. This picture here was published in TOI on 29th Nov 2009. Yes, 3 days after the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai... India rather. England Cricket team was on a tour of India.
You can see in the picture, England captain being guarded by a commando while the captain is on the street heading towards his Hotel I presume. Well the thing that strikes me is, What if a terrorist had tried shooting the Captain? The man in the 'line of fire' is not the captain but the Guard yo see in-front of him. The questions that hit me is, What creates this Difference in class? What makes the life of the Captain more precious than that of the guard?
The captain may be good with hitting the ball on a 'Life-friendly' playground. But the guard is also great with protecting lives, protecting nation with his accurate aim on the enemies. Leave the so called 'hero of a nation' on a battle field, he is helpless as a fly caught in a web. So the brain(in this case, the talent) is not a thing that differentiates. Is it that the captain wears an Adidas jacket and the guard a cheap military cloth? That the captain gets a thousand dollar haircut in fashion and the guard a home made one?
Both have their own occupations. Each specialized in their own skills. According to me, the commando here is a much more socially responsible person than the captain. So, what makes the captain's life more worthy than that of the commando? Imagine if both die in a terrorist attack. The death of the captain will be a great loss(world shock) for years. But no one will bother to remember the name of the commando except for their 'Below Poverty Line' family!!!
Sweden is in recession. Most companies and organisations are cutting down on their R&D and trimming external consultants. The whole media sector is experiencing disruptive changes, many of them are seeing their revenues dwindling.   I find it a bit strange that everybody in the established media sector seem to agree on:

There will be big turmoil in their markets due to internet and media digitalisation.
Nobody really knows what will happen or what will work in the near future.
And still they cut down on R&D!
It is as if they just hope that somebody else will come up with a working internet business model and they will be able to jump on that wagon when it starts moving and then everything will be fine again.

But hey, there will not be one or two internet business models replacing today’s media models.
There will be hundreds!

And we are now seeing just the beginning of the media industry disruption, it will get much worse soon.

But disruptive times have always created opportunities for those that see them, often people from outside the existing industries, people that are not hindered by “we have never done it like that before”, or “that won’t work”.

The way to create real innovation and progress in disruptive times is to gather a wild mix of creative people of all types and enable them to brainstorm and network. Add the low cost of developing and live test web apps these days and great stuff can evolve quickly!
The curse of a hurt man.... Hi, all… I do not appreciate personal blogs which are just related to the person writing but this time I cant help… I have to tell this… Please read it as far as you could….
Its midnight, I m somewhere between Thursday and Friday and undoubtedly one of the happiest guy. The reason is very very simple but quiet have a history of its own, SPS BULLS lost. Yes you heard me right, SPS BULLS lost and I m lot lot more happier than the guys who shot them down. Its an Oh I Say!!!! Moment for me, watching the game from far away, so far I do not have any idea of score and knew only when they lost but ah they lost… Nothing can get more gratifying then this….

Why do I need to be so happy, it had to happen. They were destined for the defeat and I knew it very early… earlier than this fixture was declared.. earlier than this tournament began, even earlier than last one…Once upon a time, when i was hurt, i was really hurt by many guys, i never showed any emotion, not even to myself in alone… But today i did… I laughed.. I screamed and if there exists a parallel universe, I want to console that boy who is alone, hurt, whose ego is bruised and who cannot do anything for it but to keep quiet… Time stood by me… You all see, time stood by my side and I m laughing with him over you assholes who always demanded without even thinking how much effort I ever put. Assholes who always wanted me to keep there words but never kept my smallest of feeling. Who were stars but never care how much my hands are burnt in this stardom. Don’t get me wrong, I never asked for credit but at least listen before discarding anyone hardwork just because it doesn’t fit to your moronism…
I don’t need credit, I had enough… But I can never forget the questions asked to me, especially by the boy whom I always took care about… He hurt me not the year ago but way before than that… when we were in 2nd year and he wounded me so much that I did what I never even thought of… it was shameful but I have no control over the fury I had within…. and we both knew it...

I don’t think anyone else than me would be interested in all the things I wrote but if you are still reading it means you could sense what I m talking about…

Exactly an year ago I had to face allegations, serious ones from the guys who do not know what a team mean, who have no idea how its made, and what it takes to keep a team alive. One of the mediator, Sandeep asked me, do i have any answer to these allegements, i then said i have 100 replies of their each question but i need not to answer a single of them, because i was million percent confident of their fate. i would have confirmed their doom that week itself but Sandeep f betrayed me and shamelessly unwrapped my mission of making a new team and its painfull.. more than you could ever imagine… They would have ate the dust there only but sandeep exposed it before time and I was ravaged…
You might be thinking we are here to study and why the hell should I take Cricket so seriously, but no, it was serious, more than even i could imagine and it was about how we live and how we think… but I m happy that serious cricket is over and my time with assholes too…
Now i m happily semi retire and play for warriors, a lovely team who listen me and even i never ever shown my face in practice and friendly matches but they want me in their team as far as i think. Cricket as a game is over for me and i play just to be with the guys who took me when other teams like Broomsticks refused to take me in their team. Anyways where the hell is Broomsticks ????


At last about SPS BULLS… i have many things to say but i don’t think anyone would be interested, you already had enough reading it till here and i cannot ask for more..
There dream of Major Tournament is over in 1st round and i advice to them is that none of you ever had strength of this major tournament… Try your luck in Super 6 in Fuera, I m not going to play that but my good wishes for that..

Those guys didn’t won a single game after, not a single game in the major tournament and stars of yesterdays are out in 2 consecutive tournaments in the 1st round….

1 year… 2 Tournament… 0 Wins…
Well Done Boys!!!! After all you did this without me…..
Sous-Vide and Low-Temp Primer Part I

We have had a lot of requests to make last week’s low-temp charts available for download. Here you go: 


Click here to download the sous vide charts.
We are often accused of being long-winded. Guilty. When we looked at the sous-vide primer, however, even we thought it was too long—so we decided to break it into parts. We hope to put out a new section every week (or so). This is how we plan on breaking it down:

I . Introduction to Low-Temperature Cooking and Sous-Vide (Today’s Installment)
II. Use and Abuse of the Vacuum Machine and Packing for Low-Temp Without the Vac
III. Vacuum Tricks
IV. Temperature Control and Safety
V. Cooking Meats and Poultry
VI. Cooking Fish
VII. Cooking Everything Else
Today we have the introduction. It provides an overview for everything else. There won’t be any specific applications or how-to’s in this section. That is for later.

Part I. Introduction to Low-Temperature Cooking and Sous-Vide

I. Getting the Terms Right
Low-Temperature Cooking Defined

III. Low Temperature Cooking Disadvantages
Surface Browning, the Maillard Reaction, and the Challenges of Low-Temperature Cooking
Uniformity of Texture
IV. Why do Chefs Use Sous Vide?
Sous-Vide for Economy
Storage
Organization
Sous-Vide for Effect
Texture Modification
Flash Pickling and Vacuum Marination
Forming
De-airing
I. GETTING THE TERMS RIGHT:

Sous-vide and low-temperature cooking are just two of the many techniques and processes that are revolutionizing modern cooking. Despite their growing popularity, many remain confused about the difference between low-temperature cooking and sous-vide—including equipment manufacturers. Between the two, low-temperature cooking is undoubtedly the more important.

Low-Temperature Cooking Defined:
Cooking low temperature does not mean cooking food to a lower internal temperature than is traditional. Low-temperature cooking refers to the temperature of the cooking medium, not the final temperature of the food being cooked. A rare steak has the same internal temperature whether cooked low-temperature or traditionally. Low temperature cooking is defined as any cooking procedure where the cooking temperature is at or close to the desired final internal temperature. There are two basic requirements for low-temperature cooking:

precise and accurate temperature control;
a cooking medium which conducts heat more efficiently and accurately than dry air. Water and water vapor are typical, but oil, stock, or any other liquid will work.
By way of example: to cook a steak to an internal temperature of 55°C (131°F), you could either sear it and put it in a 205°C (400°F) finishing oven till it reaches 55°C (131°F) (not low temperature cooking), or quickly sear it and throw it into an oil bath maintained at 55°C (131°F) (low temperature cooking but not sous-vide).

In traditional high-temperature cooking, the temperature of the cooking medium is almost never the same as the desired temperature of the food. That is, while your oven may be heated to 205°C (400°F), your fry oil can to 190°C (375°F), and poaching water to 100°C (212°F), a steak cooked in those mediums can only be considered rare when it reaches an internal temperature of 54°C (129°F). The difference between the desired final food temperature and the temperature of the cooking medium is referred to as temperature delta, or ΔT (pronounced “delta t,” the triangle is the Greek letter delta). You should just get used to referring to ΔT’s –like, “hey, you want that squab cooked to 56°C? Do you want to use a ΔT?”

Sous-Vide Defined:

In contrast, the simplest way to define sous-vide may be to refer to its French meaning, “under vacuum.” Anything associated with a vacuum machine is sous-vide. In restaurants, the sous-vide process usually (but not always) consists of:

placing products into impervious plastic bags
putting those bags under vacuum
heat sealing those bags
releasing the vacuum
further manipulating, processing, or storing
This is where it gets confusing: sous-vide techniques are often used for low temperature cooking, but not all sous-vide cooking is low-temperature cooking. The classic example of this is boil-in-bag meals. The cooking medium is boiling water—not low temperature. Yet, because there is a vacuum process involved, it is sous-vide. That said, sous-vide is very effective for low-temp cooking because food inside the bags neither dries out nor loses flavor during prolonged cooking if proper temperature is maintained. The vacuum bags also eliminate evaporation and evaporative cooling. The temperature of the food’s surface becomes identical to the cooking temperature after a short time.

Chefs and diners alike often confuse sous-vide and low-temperature cooking. Sous-vide must involve a vacuum process; but the food may be cooked at high or low temperatures. About 90% of what cooks want to achieve with low temperature cooking can be achieved without a vacuum.

II. SOME USES AND ADVANTAGES OF LOW TEMPERATURE COOKING:

Uniform Cooking, Increased Consistency, and Shifting Control to the Chef:


Traditional steak vs. low-temp steak.
Traditional cooking typically uses a high ΔT. Foods cooked in this manner display an overcooked portion on the exterior. Meat cooked at high temperatures does not have one level of doneness—it is tasted as an average, from the well-done exterior to the less cooked center. Low-temperature cooking is less forgiving, because there is no way to average out errors. In a steak cooked at a low ΔT, the steak retains the same temperature throughout. The difference of 2°C can make a large difference in texture when there is no averaging effect—you need good temperature control (The entire range of steak doneness, from rare to well-done, is only a matter of 14°C (25°F). Luckily, modern equipment easily gives us temperature control accurate down to a tenth of a degree, which means we can cook products extremely uniformly and get them right 100% of the time.

Uniformity can be a disadvantage—no one wants a giant piece of roast beef that is one color all the way across—but most of the time uniformity is an advantage because it leads to increases consistency. Your steaks will never be over or under –always just right. This advantage cannot be overstated, and it applies to restaurants or home cooks. Additionally, because the hard work of reaching the correct internal temperature is being regulated by an accurate piece of equipment, the responsibility for getting the product right is shifted away from the line cook towards the chef who is choosing the temperature and setting the machine.

Shifting Work from Service to Prep (or from Party to Prep at Home):

We can always make more prep time. Service is what service is. Any time we can shift work away from service towards prep we win. Many low temp techniques require more prep time than their traditional counterparts; but are blindingly fast to finish off at service time. The high speed finish derives from the fact that the food is pre-cooked and can be held warm and ready to go, only needing a few seconds of finishing time. Speed finishing is a boon to the home cook as well. Parties are a lot more fun when you can hang out with your guests and all your food is in perfect finish at the same time.

Low-Temp for Insurance:
Low-temp cooking can provide a type of cooking insurance by guaranteeing a minimum doneness. Here’s how:

1. Low temp your food to the rarest you want it. The food is now uniformly rare.
2. Cool the product completely.
3. Cook the product traditionally, but focus only on obtaining the perfect exterior because the middle is already cooked. You have insured that the inside is done.
Here are some examples of low-temp for insurance:

Roasts can be challenging. Often you get a good crust before the middle is done and then overcook the whole piece to bring up the center. Other times, you focus on getting the middle perfect but end up with a poor crust. Low-temp insurance fixes that. Low temp the roast till it is rare and cool it down. Put the roast in a high oven and pull it when the crust is perfect—you have already insured that the middle is done.
On a beef Wellington it is very difficult to insure that the puff pastry and the beef come out nicely at the same time. Usually the meat is overcooked or the pastry is too blond. With low-temp insurance you sear and pre-cook and cool your tenderloin and then wrap it in puff pastry. Now, you can turn your oven up and just focus on getting the pastry nice and brown since your meat is already cooked.
Sausages are often poached before being finished in a pan on the grill. This is high-temp cooking insurance. Instead, low temp-cook the sausages (60-62°C is usually good), then finish them on a grill or in the pan. The low-temp pre-cook doesn’t overcook the meat and rely on fat alone to provide juiciness.
Duck breast is best cooked with low-temp insurance. Pre-cook the breast to 57°C and cool it down. Then just focus on crispy skin.
Low-temp for insurance tends to produce items that have textures and appearances very close to traditionally cooked items, just better and more consistent. Because the products have a traditional feel, many cooks like this technique.

Low-Temp for New and Novel Textures:
Low-temperature cooking also allows for the production of some textures that were traditionally unattainable. Three examples:

Super-low temp fish: Fish heated at extremely low temperatures, around 50°C or (122°F) to an internal temperature of 42°C (107°F), has a dense, fudge-like or custard quality unattainable with high ΔT cooking. This type of cooking is controversial; many chefs dislike the texture attained with these methods, and some scientists believe the techniques are unsafe. Other chefs believe that the traditional cooking method overcooks fish and that the low-temperature method is best.
Low temperature braises: In a typical braise, meat with a lot of connective tissue is cooked at a high temperature for several hours. The high temperature and several hours is what is needed to break down the collagen into gelatin. This process overcooks the muscle and dries it out. Luckily, the gelatin re-moistens the overcooked meat and produces a delicious braise. When a meat is under-braised, it seems tough and dry because the collagen hasn’t melted into juicy, water holding gelatin. With low temperature cooking, however, we can hold a tough piece of meat at a very precise temperature for a very long time. If a short rib is held at 6o°C (140°F) it will maintain a lightly pink, medium-cooked color for days. The texture of the muscle fiber itself will also remain somewhat static. The connective tissue, on the other hand, won’t break down over the course of 3 or 4 hours at this temperature—you need to cook it for two full days. At the end of these two days, however, you will have a completely pink, completely tender short rib that is a dream to slice and portion.
Creamy egg yolks: When you heat a whole in-shell egg in water to 63°C (145°F), the yolk becomes creamy—not runny, not set. One degree lower is a runny yolk. One degree higher is a set yolk. The 63°C egg is a delight and completely impossible to make traditionally. More on eggs later.
Low-Temp for Increased Tenderness:

Low-temperature cooking can also produce meats that are more tender than normal. Enzymes responsible for some of the benefits of dry-aging meat increase activity as the temperature rises. These enzymes are most active right before they denature, between 49°C and 54.4°C (120°F and 129.9°F). Because low-temperature cooking allows meat to stay in this zone longer than traditional cooking, meat is more tender than normal. Traditionally, a large piece of meat heated for a long period of time, such as a roast, remains tender. Low-temperature cooking makes it possible for smaller pieces of meat to be held at these low temperatures for longer periods of time.

III. LOW TEMPERATURE COOKING DISADVANTAGES

Surface Browning, the Maillard Reaction, and the Challenges of Low-Temperature Cooking:

Low-temperature cooking does not produce crisp, flavorful, brown exteriors, which are usually obtained by cooking at high temperatures. Much of the artistry of low-temp cooking involves getting around this limitation. Some techniques include:

Using meaty, savory flavors like soy sauce and miso (both are high in umami).
Quick-searing meats for flavor either before they are cooked, right before they are served, or both. Quick-searing in low-temperature cooking is performed at a higher than normal temperature to develop a brown crust without overcooking the interior of the meat.
Browning bones, fat, inexpensive pieces of meat, or vegetables and putting them into the vacuum bag along with the main food before cooking. The savory notes of the added pieces permeate the food over time. Roasted fat is especially useful, as many of the characteristic flavors of different meats are generated by the taste of cooked and broken down fats.
Uniformity of Texture:

The biggest gripe people have with low-temp cooking is that the uniformity of texture. Some people say that all low temp food is “mushy.” While it is true that bad-low temp food is mushy, good low-temp food doesn’t have to be. One of the ways to guard against uniformity is to provide texture in the finishing step—usually by searing. Adding crunchy garnishes or cooking portions of the food separately to compensate for the lack of textural variety is another option. A chicken breast cooked sous-vide, for example, might be served with a piece of crispy fried chicken skin (although we have had good chicken this way, we find the skin served this way not as satisfying as good-old crispy skin that is still stuck to the chicken). Lastly, European chefs often cook with a moderate ΔT (usually 10-15 C) to “overcook” the outside of the food and provide some textural variation. Most Americans don’t cook this way because it require precise temperature measurement, precise timing, or both. Most Americans cook with 0 ΔT and add texture in the finishing step.

IV. WHY DO CHEFS USE SOUS-VIDE? SOUS-VIDE FOR ECONOMY AND SOUS-VIDE FOR EFFECT

Chefs may use sous-vide techniques and processes for a variety of reasons which roughly break down into two categories: sous-vide for economy and sous-vide for effect. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, therefore it’s important to thoroughly understand both.

Sous-Vide For Economy:

Storage:

Traditionally, vacuum-packing has been used to enhance the storage life of cooked products. The bacteria that cause food spoilage need oxygen to survive. Since vacuum packaging removes all air (and therefore oxygen) from food, spoilage is slowed drastically if the proper steps are taken. Oxidation is also greatly reduced by utilizing vacuum-packing. Foods like cut apples and artichokes do not turn brown quickly in vacuum pouches. In long-term storage, vacuum bags can prevent the oxygen-produced rancidity of unsaturated fats. Low-moisture products like dehydrated fruit chips tend to stay crispy indefinitely in the low-moisture vacuum environment.

Unfortunately, some bacteria that cause illness (pathogens) are not inhibited by a lack of oxygen. In fact, some of the most dangerous bacteria thrive only in the absence of oxygen. If sous-vide products are kept in unsafe conditions, these pathogens can grow to dangerous levels without the simultaneous spoilage that would normally signal their presence. This is why it is important to adhere to safety rules when using sous-vide.

Organization:

Vacuum-packed pre-portioned foods are neat, sanitary, and easy to organize. Many portions of the same product can be fabricated at the same time and then sealed, which minimizes cross-contamination. The food is handled minimally before being placed in a sterile environment. Retrieving food is easy, and each portion is individually protected from spills and other dangers, such as a raw product dripping onto a cooked product.

Sous-Vide for Effect:

Recently, the unique properties of the sous-vide process have inspired a cooking movement that aims solely to increase the quality of food and achieve special culinary effects. Think of this as sous-vide for effect.

Texture Modification (aka Compression):

The key to this technique is long vacuuming to get all the air out of the inside of the food. After the food is sealed and the vacuum released, there is an immediate observable change in the product as the voids that used to contain air are compressed. On some products, the effects of compression are accentuated over time (pears become more translucent after several hours). This process can be accelerated by re-vacuuming the sealed bag until the bag inflates with water vapor and then releasing the vacuum.

Porous foods can have their texture and appearance radically modified by vacuum-packaging. Watermelon, for instance, becomes denser, changing from a mealy to a candy-like texture. Pears, cucumbers, and tomatoes become translucent.





Flash Pickling and Vacuum Marination:

Vacuum-packaging foods increases the uptake of flavorful liquids, brines, and colors. The more porous the item, the more dramatic the end results are. For example, a pear can be colored with port in an hour under vacuum. Cucumbers and other vegetables can be flash pickled in seconds. Meats can be brined in much less time than at atmospheric pressure.

Forming :

The pressure exerted by the atmosphere can be used to form dishes. Layers of food can be pressed extremely flat. Once removed from the bag, these compressed layers become easy to slice into beautiful portions. Food can be arranged as in a terrine, vacuumed, solidified, and sliced for decorative effects. Some effects formerly achieved with a simple mold and a weight can be achieved more easily with a vacuum machine.

De-airing :

When thick sauces and purées are blended, they often have large amounts of air whipped into them. Sometimes this air is undesirable. When chefs use modern thickeners and gelling agents, like xanthan gum, trapped air becomes a problem, as it affects the body of the sauce and its appearance (liquids with many air bubbles appear white and opaque). The thicker the sauce, the more difficult it is to remove air. Sauces that contain too much air can be made crystal clear by removing the air bubbles in a vacuum machine.

Any liquid can have all their bubbles removed in a vacuum machine. Place the liquid in an appropriately wide container (not a bag) inside the vacuum machine. If there is too much liquid in the container, the mixture will boil over and create a mess during the process. Close the chamber and introduce a vacuum; the liquid will start to rise and bubble. Soon after, the initial bubbles will break and the liquid will enter a rolling boil. At this point the vacuum can be released and the liquid will have cleared. This procedure is one scenario where there is no need to pre-chill the product being vacuumed because the desired outcome is to have the product boil.

Formal vs informal education »   My sister Mimi and I are opposite in many ways. She was a straight A student and I was a solid B student. She seemed to be able to focus and get through her schoolwork easily where I struggled.   My sister ended up with her choice of any university she wanted to go to and ended up first at Harvard and then at Stanford and is now in the midst of an academic career.   I, on the other hand, was unable to get into any of my first choice universities and ended up dropping out after a few years. I was later convinced to go back to university again by a well known physicist I was working with and dropped out again after becoming disillusioned with formal education as well as my ability to pay attention and learn anything. (I also discovered the amazing community that was the Chicago nightlife scene of the late 80s.)   I think it's fair to say that the most important thing that I learned in my formal education was touch typing in junior high school and possibly the importance of camaraderie and athletics during high school wrestling.   Despite my completely dysfunctional relationship with formal learning, I've been able to learn enough to run companies, give talks and be allowed to go to some of the same conferences as my sister.   I was talking to my sister whose research focus is learning and digital media. We were discussing formal learning versus informal learning and how I probably survived because I had the privilege of having access to smart people and mentors, the support of an understanding mother, an interest driven obsessive personality and access to the Internet. I completely agree that improving formal education and lowering dropout rates is extremely important, but I wonder how many people have personalities or interests that aren't really that suited for formal education, at least in its current form.  I wonder how many people there are like me who can't engage well with formal education, but don't have the mentors or access to the Internet and end up dropping out despite having a good formal education available to them. Is there a way to support and acknowledge the importance of informal learning and allow those of us who work better in interest and self-motivated learning to do so without the social stigma and lack of support that is currently associated with dropping out of formal education?   Or... is the answer to make formal education more flexible and capable of supporting a wider spectrum of types of learning to enable people like me to "make it through the system"? Oddly, as my informal education has finally started to reach limits in certain areas, I find myself increasingly reaching out to formal education institutions for the rigor and depth that I need to explore my areas of interest.
The comments on any youtube video are many times the best part of that video. I wouldn't say that's the case with I AM DRUGS however. The talented folks involved in making these short, fake PSA's precludes them from low balling the viewer. That said, most of the vids in this series consistently get passed around, and every few months, a few of them receive another 20,000 or so hits seemingly over night. 

And when they do, the next day is like Christmas morning for us here at Drink at Work.

Based on the comments, it seems that perhaps 10% of the viewers understand the videos are a joke. The rest are fiercely angry at what they believe to be government anti-drug propaganda... or even better, the misinformation they claim we're sharing. 

Mostly it's the pot heads who get riled up, but lately the PCP crowd and the DM42 fans have been chiming in with their own personal experiences with these respective substances.


None of which matters. What does matter is that these people are insane, numerous, and love to have fights on our youtube vid comments sections. And here is some of that magic for you today
Black and white does not scare us. It’s the grey things that are scary. They are the ones that defy classification. They are the ones you want to classify as white, yet in your heart you know they could as well be black. What happened that day was a gray thing, a dark gray thing if you will. My native place is Paravaicheri which is a village about 50 Km south of Chennai. Almost every weekend I used to take a bus from Koyambedu bus stand at about 8 PM. I would reach my village at about 9 30 PM. I had to walk 2 km from the high way to reach my house. I had lived in the village for most of my life, till I came to Chennai to join college. I got a job in Chennai after finishing college. So effectively for almost four and half years I had undertaken this journey almost every weekend and there had never been any event of significance save for a couple of bus breakdowns. So that day, as I boarded the bus late at 9 PM, surprised to find it so empty, I had no reason to doubt that my journey was going to be any different this time. There were hardly seven people in the bus including the conductor and driver. I put on my headset and started listening to songs on my Sony Ericcson.  Two men who were sitting two rows ahead of me were conversing about whether or not the world will end in 2012. I increased the volume in my phone to tune out their voices. I closed my eyes after setting alarm for 10 PM. The constant roaring of the engine served as a perfect lullaby as I dozed off within five minutes, oblivious of the impending nightmare. I woke up with a disturbed feeling after ten minutes. I blinked. The interior of the bus was dark. And I noticed the glowing letters in the panel behind the driver:  I was amused that I had not noticed it before. It was pitch dark outside and it beat me why they would want to switch off the lights inside the bus. I saw that the two people in the seats two rows ahead of me were still. The rhythmic sound of the engine sounded lonelier than silence. I turned back to see the conductor and was shocked to see that he was in the seat behind me and his eyes were fixed on me and there was a smile pasted in his face. Yes, it was pasted because it did not grow or fade in intensity.  “Why are the lights switched off?” He did not seem to have heard me though I spoke from the seat in front of his. He kept staring into my eyes, his lips frozen in an eternal smile. There were green fields on either side of the road for as far as I could see. The green was barely visible in the moonlight though and The only light in the road was the bus’s head lights and the highway seemed to be deserted and no other vehicle passed in either direction. I looked out through the window and noticed there were no lights on the road either. I did not remember such a long stretch in the road without lights. And it was then that I noticed that the bus was going through a street, a muddy path and not a tar road. Now I would have definitely noticed it in all the years of travel.  “This bus goes to Thindivanam right?” I asked in panic. And I turned to see the conductor still smiling at me with resolve. I did not understand whether he was trying to be funny or something was wrong. I simply stood up and went up to the two people sitting two rows ahead of me. In the darkness of the bus, I could not see their face. I asked them the same question. One of them looked up. I took out my mobile phone to shine the light on him, but found it had switched off.   “Tell me a number between one and ten.” He said.  I blinked assuming I had heard him wrong.   “No. I was asking about the bus. Where does it go? I thought it went to Thindivanam.”  “Tell me a number between one and ten.” He repeated and every intonation in the sentence sounded just like it had when he asked the previous time. I kept looking at him wondering if he had teamed up with the conductor to play a prank on me. 
When he repeated the same sentence with exact same intonation of the syllables, I knew this wasn’t normal.
Then arose a cry for equality, from men and women courageous enough to stand up to their oppressors. And then began a battle without. This battle was of little consequence until men and women of all types could set aside their differences and accept their humanity as their first identity, their equality as a matter of course. Slowly, the tides turned. People became more tolerant. And yet the battle was not won. It is not won. Often, equality has been confused with bland conformity, which resulted in socialist and marxist movements. Noble were their ideals and yet, as history has shown, they were doomed to fall. In hindsight, this is obvious, because every man and woman seeks to be different, to stand out from the crowd, to achieve a higher station in society, to be appreciated. At the same time, man strives for acceptance among his peers and in comes the necessity for conforming to social norms. In my opinion, neither extreme is likely to succeed.
To Nine.
Thursday, 11 March 2010
It is three minutes to nine. Soon the pendulum will strike true west, and mark another hour washed into the abyss of lost time condemned to eternal waste. Still I sit here active in inaction; pondering over my seventeen inch prison bars taunting me with meaningless pixilation of lights.

Three minutes past nine. Six wasted minutes over three pointless sentences. Inspiration still hid behind the inexorable walls of Hadrian. The light of words-smiting lost behind barbarity of procrastination.

Six minutes past nine. I wonder about the curious day past. Predicate, Delegate; I am drowning in my own world of algorithmic hypnotism.

Tab, Tab, Enter, Type, Tab, Enter, Type, Tab, F5, Tab, Tab, Tab, Crash; eighteen minutes past nine and I am writing absolute nonsense.

"why do pride forever stop us taking words back,
why do we still chain ourselves to begone past?"
scammed!!!!   ok... this is what i want you to do... imagine with me here... it wont be hard, trust me…  you were tired, frustrated, so much that you almost gave a serious thought to becoming a hippie (also known as junkie in some cultures), but only got drunk and puked and lost all hope and you drowned in the alcohol swirl (you know what i mean, its hard to put that in words, i'm talking about the feeling where you feel like sleeping and wanting to stay awake and not say anything but talk to someone all at the same time, you know, yes you do... ). morning, woken up by a phone call (stay with me, the realization of the situation is necessary to justify what is gonna happen)... yes this is him...huh..."you have just been chosen to be the winner of a 1000$ gift card and that it'll be sent to you, just give your address for shipping"... shock, pause, brainwaves: could this be finally one of those moments when the stint of bad luck is over and the wheels have finally turned and the "new day" has dawned, and you say what the heck why not. If the situation was any different I would've analyzed the whole situation and observed the fact that she mentions that i was chosen in a draw conducted by VISA, the company that is on your credit card, of which i hold a debit card, and they already have my address on file, so why bother calling me n asking something which they should already know? But, as it turns out, $1000 is a pretty big amount, and its just address, what're they gonna do, send me a packet of Anthrax??!!!

Here, can i sleep now??!! No, you have also won along with it a subscription for 2 magazines every week, and you need to chose which magazines from a list of 60. Hmmm... ok... how bad can it be?!! I can always use some magazines, they look good in your bathroom, which also has a toilet, and a flush tank, with cover, over which you can keep them!! So what do you have!?? ESPN (sports, hmmm, a way to gain enough knowledge to stop those ManU fans in their tracks when they get offensive, which they always are, because they feel pity for the team that died, and think that they have somehow resurrected from ruins, and what not, sure they are on top of EPL, but thats because they have a lot more money, which is because of you (manU fans) !!), and National Geographic traveller (ooh, that'd be good, I can atleast learn about the places where I would go when I have enough money to buy Hawaii!!), GQ (now that was literally born to be in a bathroom!!!), etc etc (you thought I'm gonna list all 60 didn ya??) 

now wait a second and i'll connect ya to our sales department... sure... hi this is AssHole, how can i help ya... well i was connected by AssHole(female), (something you'll notice, these guys always make sure they mention their names, like they are very unique and somehow is a sign of gaining trust, hello sir, good morning, this is Ben, how can i help ya, well i feel so comfortable already that i want to ask if he is the ben from Ben 10??!!), and she was mentioning about some magazine n some gift card. Yes, i'd be glad to help you now, let me explain, you can chose 3 magazines every week, you just have to pay for the delivery, which is 3.45$ a week, and you can get the magazines for the next 60 months (5 yrs!!!), now to make your life easier, we will charge you 50$ every month for the next 20 months, and pay nothing for the next 40. Now i can go ahead and book your order right now, would you like to use a VISA or a MasterCard?!!

ok hold, i thought this was free, m not gonna give my credit card number to someone who just called me in the morning and promise to send me something, and ask for it, what did you say the name of your company is?!! Blue whale publications, me googling as soon as he said it, and sure enough, more scam alerts than a legit website... thank you sir for your offer, but i'll buy those magazines myself... 

This is a post intended to increase awareness, and protect your personal identity, and your money, and your sanity, and your account, and your money, oh i said that already... so thats all that you can save... 

Me in my last 6 months here in the United States have been either a victim of or was almost a victim of about 4 scams/mishaps. sure enough, m gonna put em all up, after all my biggest fans, Me n Myself, deserve to know about it...

UK to forbid Open WiFi – FON can help  As ZDNET reported, the UK government will not make an exception with its proposed Digital Economy Bill for public institutions offering “Open WiFi”. The Digital Economy Bill intends to crackdown on illegal downloads of copyright protected data. The bill suggests that ISPs could shut down a subscriber’s internet connection if the subscriber has repeatedly committed copyright infringement via his internet connection.   These penalties not only apply to individual subscribers, but also to institutions and businesses who leave their WiFi open to guests or members. This means, if a bar-owner leaves his WiFi open, and a customer accesses the internet and downloads content illegally, the bar owner will be held responsible. The ISP could even temporarily suspend the subscription. The same is true for libraries, universities and all kinds of shops. So, de facto, this would mean an end to open and unprotected WiFi in the UK.  That is bad news for anybody who wants to offer WiFi to their guests!  But, the good news is that FON can help!  FON service is unaffected by this bill as we comply with all the requirements of the UK government. FON does not offer open and anonymous WiFi access to the internet, but controls the access. Users who log on to FON need to be registered with FON. We know their identity confirmed by payment details such as credit card or phone number. We comply with all requirements of the UK Telco Regulation and collaborate with authorities if requested to identify copyright infringement cases. Just like other hotspot operators.  So, all a bar, café, shop or institution needs to do is use our Fonera WiFi router instead of an WiFi router with “open WiFi”. With a Fonera router, anyone can offer WiFi safely to their customers and not have to worry about copyright or other infringements. FON manages the access to the network.  The Fonera+ is available for purchase in the UK for just £29.95 at our FON Shop.
Living a Purposeful life A pianist without a piano, a businessman without business, a coach without trainee, a temple without deity, food without nutrients, a music without rhythm, a book without knowledge and a life without purpose are same. They are not what they are. They looses their relevance.  When the river is bound between two banks and flow to its source, its a river and when the banks are dissolved and there is are no direction it become flood. Same resource which is so life supporting may become the cause of destruction to self and around. Isn't it! Same is the case when life force energy has no purpose and its wondering in this world its like flooded river, all over the places. Purpose is like banks which makes a river, river; similarly purpose makes life a LIFE!

One- who doesn't bother about this topic, who doesn't care about having a purpose. For them life is eat, sleep, dance and die. For them life is routine everyday and life is driven by sensual requirement or sensual pleasures.
Two- who have some purpose in their life. They want to accomplish in this life.
Three- who have rose above this and know there is no purpose. We are here to celebrate the life, to be witness to the existence.

There is huge difference between the quality of consciousness of the first and third case. Sometime people get into conceptual knowledge and become inert, dull and lethargic saying that there is no purpose to this life, they are basically running away from outer dynamism which exhibit the selfless service with inner peace. To reach to this stage of selfless service one goes through the active dynamism which exhibits self-motivated goals (2nd stage). Most of time mind get stuck into the strong matrix (Maya) created by society or this world and start living in illusion of having a purpose which is nothing but conditioning given by society. For example when you say you want to be doctor because everybody is my class for medical school or you really want to be a doctor? or you want to get married because in society everybody is getting married or you really want to get married? You want to go for shopping why because everybody is going or you really want it? You want to earn money because you need money or everybody does that so you need to do? Do you see there is huge difference in actions also.

I remember a very interesting story which put some light about the discussion. Once the Creator of this creation thought enough of drama done. Lets dissolve this creation and universe. He called for a meeting and all creatures animals, plants, mosquitoes, butterflies, tiger, horses, cow, humans, billion of creatures, everybody came.
Then, He said, "now I want to dissolve this creation since there is no purpose but before that I want to ask you all about your purpose. Do you want to share."
Everybody said, "YES." 
Then He asked butterflies what is your purpose. 
Butterflies said we are here so that we can add color to this creation make the garden more beautiful. Everybody cheered. 
Then He asked flowers what is your purpose of existence. 
Flower replied so that I can add fragrance and beauty to existence. Again everybody clapped and cheered. 
Then He asked donkeys what is your purpose. 
Donkeys replied so that we can help humans to carry their weights we are useful for transportation. 
Same way God went around and ask all the creation and everybody added something or the other. Then He came to Humans and asked what is your purpose of existence and there was deep silence. No humans knew why they are here. They started asking each other do you know, do you know? When no answer came then God turned to other animals, plants and asked them do you what is the purpose of human being? Then everybody was shouting yes I know, yes I know, flowers were shouting yes we know why humans are here, river was saying yes I know why humans are here, even donkeys were telling yes I know why humans are here. And story end. Do you see what this story tell us.
Here's an idea that is just begging to be implemented as a Firefox extension.

You know how there's a while-you-type spell checker that's always on when you are editing text in a multi-line text box? There should be a feature that takes the last few words you're typing (or the entire current paragraph, or whatever works best), does a Google search, and presents snippets for the top few results in an unobtrusive pop-up window.

Sure, maybe you're thinking "It looks like you're writing a letter. Do you want me to write it for you?" (the Microsoft paperclip). But using web search instead of a fixed set of patterns could actually make this useful. Imagine the number of messages to customer support forums that will never have to be sent because this feature pops up the answer the user was looking for. And so on.

You might also think, "this already exists, it's called Google auto-suggest." But I specifically want it to work when I'm not (yet) actively searching, but just writing. (If it already existed, it might have stopped me from writing this blog post. :-) Twitter might also become a different place if users realized how many others have already entered the same item.

Of course there's a little privacy issue. But still, if this existed, I'd opt in! (In fact, I did half a dozen searches while I was typing this. How much easier it would be if I didn't have to select text, switch to a different tab, paste, and hit enter, losing my writing context each tim.
Scumbag. He would brook no protest or discussion, cutting us off with "This is not a theology class". Hope you read this someday. Your attempts at indoctrination were transparent to most of us- we used to discuss them after class. Don't get me wrong. I used to play the guitar in the choir daily, and on every Friday, join the boys' choir in singing praises to Christ. Somehow, in that seemingly nonsecular school, there was still a separation of Church and "state". That balance, of course, was changed by Mr. Easwaran. Suddenly, we had an authority figure teaching us the history of the world from the viewpoint of one religion. Even in an inherently Christian nation like the United States, a similar incident created such a furor. In multi-religious Hindu majority India, surprisingly, nobody heard about it. Not one person bothered. The same scene is being repeated in many Indian schools. Does it matter? Hinduism seems yet undecided on its stance on whether it is an organized religion or a way of life; whether it is an "it", in the sense of an ancient religion whose adherents are slowly being outnumbered in its last bastion, is still open to debate.
Maiden Walk - Flow of the wind seemed to halt
It was a mere glance ready to waltz
Confused for a second,I asked a question
Are they her eyes or two oceans
Divine those eyelids envisaged being grace
Altered to lissome as they glimpsed my face


An hour has passed,with no moment to spare
Waiting for our buses with heart refusing to dare
Adorned dusk amplified by the dulcet rain
But I am in loss and those aqua drops in gain
Bestrewed was that coy face with water droplets
And those bare arms seemed eager to melt


Now my heart is nothing but a hostage
Was it almighty who set up this stage
My foot rebelled and I knew not the path
But I was ensconced in the alluring swath
Distance between us is now less than a feet
This visceral journey made me ready to greet


That angelic face is touched by my hand
And my lips are over her humble eyes
Being Witnessed by several constellation
We are now each others destination
Hey folks,

I have asked the kind people at GoComics to do away with the ANGRY EYEBROWS comic for good. Put simply, it was an experiment that just didn’t work out. I know this comes as disappointing news to a lot of you, but this year is all about trimming the bacon fat and parlaying my talents into projects that I can be excited about.

THE ANGRY EYEBROWS COMIC CONCERN is still something I’m interested in pursuing, but not as a gag-a day comic. The plan I have in mind would be more of a web portal highlighting the current comics I’m working on, including animation projects and iPod/iPad/iPhone apps.

Thanks for those who followed the short AE experiment. More things to come in 2010.

After a busy few weeks I feel a little human again. Owlcon was pretty damn good this year. It's been a while since I've been very involved with gaming conventions so it was nice to actually run a game or two this year. My convention buddy, Marcel, didn't make it out with me this year. My dad had some time off from work and things just worked out that it fell on Owlcon weekend. While I was a little sad to not have him at Owlcon with me, it's nice knowing he enjoys spending time with my dad. I'm happy knowing he's getting to know just how great of guy my dad really is. He was slotted to run a game of Heroscape this year but I managed to wheel in all three bags by myself and tossed together a quick map that made more than a few people stop for picture or two. While I may have thought it a little sad compared to maps Marcel and I have built in the past, most people who saw it thought it was pretty neat. Next year will be massive. I'm going for height next year, and lots of roads.
How wasteful is life when you have nothing to do. How insincere one feels, how helpless and inadequate. One must keep doing. Does not matter whether it is big or small, just keep doing it. Someday someone shall recognize it. Credit is not what one would want to look for. The quality and intensity of the work is important. Credit becomes personal, individual. It shall remain within one, whereas the work done should be devoid of that individuality, should be more universal and all encompassing, including and identifiable with the common man or woman. For their benefit and well being. VK Murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the Dada Sahib Phalke Award this year. The highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. Generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. But I do not consider myself worthy of his genius. His most important works I believe were in films made by another genius, Guru Dutt.
This may be a meandering ramble of a blog, because i don't know what to type today. Hope you all had a nice late december stressful family hell season, and that you got at least one present worth putting on ebay. Just been looking thru my comment moderation options, apparently people seem to think that because i write a blog, i should write something significant and useful. Well, knickers. My blog is extremely useful to someone who may perhaps need to read these words or die. Or if they need a website window open to maximize, covering the porn you were looking at when the missus walked in. So there.  Of course, the significance of this comment seems to have been ruined by the anonymous (obviously the same person) fuck you comments posted later. So, yeah, that's why i've got comment moderation. This really is gonna be a ramble blog... Hmmm... Oh, we had another baby and you probably already know that. She is megan and her favourite ps3 game is Stuntman Ignition, which entertains her more than a box full of vtech tat. SNOW! There was snow and it was fun. Then it was shit. Then it was ice and all the idiot drivers crashed their cars, then it was good again and we could leave the house. And that's the weather. I am eating mini cornish pasties. They don't appear to have any meat in them. They do have what seems to be plasterboard inside. And carrot. So that's one of my five a day.
So I'm pretty obsessed with sharing. I used to be in the cult of beautiful objects and I would take photographs and go into a color darkroom and make giant c-prints.

Then I found flickr and my grandpa gave me his old digital camera and I started taking lots of pictures and sharing them. That was when I joined the legions of sharers. I got a major buzz when people left comments. I was hooked. I discovered Creative Commons and Open Source culture and the EFF became my personal heroes.

I shared video too, first it was personal stuff, like video tours around my Seattle apartment. Later I started sharing infrastructure for people to make things and that was really fun.

Now at MakerBot we're sharing a machine that you put together that is an object enabler. We share all the plans for it and set up a website called Thingiverse where folks can share their own digital designs for physical objects. It's my favorite thing to look at in the morning and see what new designs have been shared!

As a culture, we're figuring out that sharing is great. We're communicating and developing infrastructure like wildfire to find new ways to share our thoughts, ideas, designs, photos, videos, and pretty much anything you can think of.

I see sharing as the future of education. It used to be that in order to learn something you had to go to an institution. Now, because people are sharing how they do things and their knowledge on things, learning is often as easy as googling something.
Hello I'm back.

My current weapon of choice is Java though.

The renderer supports:
median split BVH,
thin lens and pinhole camera models,
sphere and Triangle primitives,
naive path tracing with lambertian surfaces only,
rendering in a progressive manner.
Performance is not that bad. I designed it to take full advantage of the new feature of java called Escape Analysis, so I'm not reusing objects (what leads to ugly code btw.) but creating them like crazy.

What sucks though is that there is no 1.6.0_14 java for Mac OS X yet, but I've tested in on windows and it works very well.

Pressure Cooked Stock 2: Changing Pressures, Playing with Chemistry
January 27th, 2010 · Uncategorized

posted by Dave Arnold   

This is our second post on the benefits and pitfalls of pressure cooking stocks. See the first post here.   

We recently bought a fancy new pressure cooker, in which to do fancy new tests. It’s actually a pressure canner/sterilizer—which lets me work with higher volumes and with higher pressures. First we investigated which pressures are best for cooking chicken stock and veal stock.  Second,  we tested to see if we could increase flavor extraction by treating stocks with a strong base. This test was suggested  by our reader Schinderhannes,  and it turned out to be a doozy.  


Our fancy new pressure device, the All American Sterilizer, 25 quart.
A Brief Recap  

The right pressure cookers can make stocks that are superior to traditional stocks.  In our tests, pressure cookers that vent steam while cooking made stocks that were browner and had better aroma than traditional stocks—but they tasted worse, were less balanced, and were more muted than traditional stocks.  Pressure cookers that did NOT vent steam beat conventional stocks by all criteria.  I know, it’s counterintuitive that the vented pressure cooked stocks would have better aroma  but taste worse (wouldn’t the aroma have vented off?), but we verified our results with repeated blind tastings.   


Our Iwatani pressure cooker regulates pressure by venting steam. The gauge on the right is unreliable and cannot be trusted to regulate pressure.
It seems like pressure cooked stock should always beat traditional stock because: 

There isn’t much turbulence inside a pressure cooker, so cloudiness is reduced.
Higher extraction temperatures extract flavor more completely.
Higher temperatures encourage more delicious “high temp flavors,” such as the meaty flavors caused by increased protein breakdown.
The sealed pressure cooker should preserve volatiles.
Why venting pressure cookers underperform is still a mystery to me.  But they always do.

A Note on our New Pressure Cooker
The Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry Company (WAFCO) has been making the “All American” line of pressure canners since 1930. Their pressure canners are made entirely of aluminum and are usually big (up to 41 quarts). Pressure canners are designed primarily to sterilize jars and cans for home canning—not to cook in. The standard pressure canner regulates pressure with an adjustible weight, so once working pressure is reached, it vents steam—bad. You can make the weight heavier and use the very nice and accurate gauge to regulate pressure up to about 18 or 19 psi without venting, but to really go high-pressure you want a pressure sterilizer. Pressure sterilizers are used by dentists and tattoo artists; they are basically inexpensive autoclaves.  Our WAFCO canner converts to a sterilizer just by changing out the lid.   We have the 25 quart stovetop model.  


Sterilizer Top. The valve on the right can be flipped off and on to vent as desired, but won't leak steam till you hit 25 psi. Be careful. On sterilizers this valve is connected to a long tube inside the pot. If the tube is underwater, pressurized hot liquid will spray everywhere when the lid is vented.
The pressure sterilizer will not vent  steam unless you release the valve or take the unit above 24.5 psi. It is dead quiet. A regular pressure cooker at 15 psi reaches 250° F (121° C). My pressure sterilizer running at 24.5 psi reaches 266° F (130 ° C).   


The All American Sterilizer gauge. This gauge works. Here it is reading 24.5 psi which equals a blistering 266° F (130° C). Any more pressure and the sterilizer auto vents.
The 25 quart pot heats rather slowly, and it takes a while to get the hang of regulating pressure by adjusting the gas—I plan to build a temperature regulator soon. Be careful with the sterilizer. It has a tube on the bottom of the lid. If that tube goes under the surface of your cooking liquid, the vent valve will spray hot liquid when opened. In these tests we cooked our food in stainless bains that we put inside the pressure sterilizer.  

One quirky feature of these pots: they have a  metal-on-metal seal, with no rubber gasket.   


The All American sterilizers and pressure canners use an all-metal gasketless seal.
Test Number 1, Changing Pressures   

We ran this test on previously prepared stocks so we could eliminate ingredient variables.  The tests discussed in our first pressure post indicate that pressure cooking a previously prepared stock produces similar results to creating a stock entirely in the pressure cooker.   We treated white chicken stock and brown veal stock  in five different ways, as follows:   

Heat briefly on the stove (control 1).
Pressure cook in a venting pressure cooker at 15 psi for 30 minutes (control 2).
Pressure cook at 15 psi for 30 minutes.
Pressure cook at 20 psi for 30 minutes.
Pressure cook at 24 psi for 30 minutes.

Pressure tasting: Brown veal stock on top, white chicken stock on the bottom. 15 psi non-vented was the winner, followed by regular.
You can see that higher pressures = browner color.  Chicken and veal stocks reacted similarly at the same pressures, so I’ll discuss them together.  Confirming our previous results, stovetop was better than 15 psi vented, but not as good as 15 psi.  The aroma of 15 psi vented was superior to both stovetop and 15 psi unvented—bizzare. 20 psi had a good aroma, some thought better than 15 psi unvented, but its taste was muted.  The 24 psi stock was the brownest by far, but smelled and tasted dead.  We need to run tests between 0 and 15 psi to determine optimum pressure.  

Result:  15 psi non-vented chicken and veal stocks were the winners.  

Test Number 2, Adding Lye:   

This one gets a little weird. Friend of the blog and pro-chemist Schinderhannes suggested that we try to increase the meaty flavor of stocks by disrupting the proteins with a strong base (like sodium hydroxide, also known as lye), pressure cooking them, and neutralizing the base with a strong acid (like hydrochloric acid).   Don’t get freaked out, we aren’t serving this to people—it was just a test.  

There’s something very appealing about Shinderhannes’ proposal.   Lye ( NaOH) + Hydrochloric acid (HCl) combine to make water and table salt (H2O and NaCl).  The trick to not poisoning people is neutralizing the lye.  

We don’t have access to high grade lye, so we used this:  


100% lye drain cleaner. Lye is NaOH. Don't do this at home.
Don’t use this stuff.  I don’t want to hear about you getting hurt. Eating only a small crystal will do severe,  irreparable damage to your insides.  My doctor mom used to tell me horror stories of kids who came into the ER after eating drain cleaner. Anyway, we prepared two identical batches of chicken meat and water, added some 33% lye solution to one (we added 0.5% by weight NaOH to the stock), and pressure cooked them both for 45 minutes in a non-venting pressure cooker at 15 psi.  Here is what they looked like:  


Two pressure-cooked stocks, normal on the left, with added lye on the right.
The difference is pretty plain.  The lye stock is still poisonous at this point so we need to add hydrochloric acid to neutralize it.  Problem is, I can’t get pure hydrochloric acid, so I went to the hardware store for muriatic acid, which is fairly concentrated HCl, used to clean tiles.  We added enough HCl to get a neutral reading on our pH meter.  Look what happened:  


Pouring in acid to neutralize the lye-stock caused a weird precipitation reaction.
Whoa! The stock turned white and clouded up.  I tasted it to make sure it wasn’t poison.  It wasn’t.  Then we figured out how much salt to add to the normal stock to match the salt created in the lye stock acid base reaction.  


Our chemistry set: Muriatic Acid Tile Cleaner (HCl), 100% Lye Drain Cleaner Solution (NaOH). Kosher salt (NaCl), pH Meter, Buffer Solutions.
Here is Nastassia tasting them blind.  


Since the stocks looked very different we tasted with our eyes closed.
Well, the normal stock won.  The lye stock tasted a little weird.  The next day the lye stock looked even stranger:   


After resting overnight, the lye stock (on the right) had a bunch of goop floating in it and smelled of lye.
The stock on day 2 smelled and tasted strongly of lye.  I’m  guessing the lye was trapped in the precipitate that formed when we added the acid, and it leached out overnight.  The lye taste was still present after we got rid of the cloudy stuff in our centrifuge. 

All in all, not a ready-for-prime-time technique, but a fun experiment.

Whole Fish à la Cooking Issues
January 21st, 2010 · Uncategorized

posted by Dave Arnold


Pretty picture of a fish in oil
Cooking a large whole fish is challenging.  It’s easy to overcook the outside, leave the inside raw, or both. This problem keeps cropping up for me. You see, my stepfather Gerard has three interests: drinking wine, smoking cigars, and  surf casting for striped bass. He’s an accomplished fisherman, and he catches nice big guys –36-40 inches — along the beaches of Cape Cod, whereupon he delivers them to me. When I cook for my family,  I like to cook family style. I want to serve a fish whole, and naturally I want to serve it fried. For years I just bent the suckers into a “U”, dusted them with flour, and chucked them in my deep fryer. They were good, but, truth be told, the outside was overdone and the inside wasn’t really done at all. No one noticed because I served pla pad prik style, with a generous amount of spicy Thai curry.  But Nils and I have worked out a better technique with the miracle of low temperature cooking (low-temp and sous-vide primer soon to come).

Many fish, like salmon and mackerel, don’t hold up well when cooked for a long time at low temperatures.  Their enzymes keep working while the fish is cooking, breaking down the muscle and making it mushy.  The same holds true for crustaceans.  Some of these fish also taste terrible when they’re cooked to safe bacteria-killing termperatures:  Salmon served warm, for example, shouldn’t be cooked much above 50 C for taste, but anything below 50 C is actually growing bacteria. Stripers, however, are made for low temp cooking. They don’t deteriorate in the 2.5 hours it takes to cook them low temp. and they do fine cooked all the way up to 57 C –a perfectly safe temperature. 

So how do you low-temp a striper?  They won’t fit in a vacuum machine and you don’t want to poach them.  A striper just fits into the wide roll foodsaver bags, and for a while this is how we cooked them.  I’ve been told that few things are more amusing than watching Nils and me try to get the foodsaver to vacuum the air out of a 42 inch long food saver bag that’s  bent into a U and full of fish and oil.   The “U” is a necessity: otherwise the fish won’t fit in the fryer.

One serendipidous day we had to cook a striper and we couldn’t locate any foodsaver bags — so we just filled our circulator bath with oil.  Easy, delicious, though more expensive (cause you need all that oil).  It’s our preferred method now, and here it is on a 40 inch striper:
I did manage to pick up a new-but-old hobby. When Lana and I first got married we moved away to the far away land of Tennessee. I was just a newly promoted PV2, straight out of AIT, at my first duty station and neither of us knew anyone. Before we made friends with the people I worked with at the hospital, we found puzzles when we ventured out at 3am at Walmart. Looking back, it was really a pretty darn wonderful time. It was just us and we were both on my night shift schedule. We'd sleep all day and spend the whole evening together watching movies, playing scrabble, or putting puzzles together. On my off rotation we'd pack up and head out for three or four days and forget I was in the Army. I even have the Article 15 to prove it. Lana bought a big value pack of puzzles at Walmart for us to do as a family. We tackled the small one first. We moved on quickly to the 1,000 piece puzzle. While it may not be what some call fun, I enjoy it. It's especially fun when Lana scoots up on the other side of the table. It becomes marvelous curveball of fun when Marcel sits down. Maybe you don't get it, but that's okay cause I do.
Be Professional..huh (ZeeK vs Aman) This is ZeeK...

Nowadays whenever I press F5, I discover a new Aman, a guy who on last refresh, was cursing someone where no one was their in vicinity and I m sure that on next refresh this guy is gonna kill someone (atleast professionally)..This someone is not a single personality but an entity that comprises some human faces, some computer peripherals and other things that froces me to press F5

I am a virtual existance, I dont know friendship but is it valid to say that "being professional" is better than being "a close friend" in terms of maintaining relationship with a person (a gal/ a guy..doesn't matter.)

As ZeeK, and continously watching Aman.. I wil say that "If you are professional to a person, you CANT fight with him/her".
I need 5 bucks and I have 2 options, First one is to ask a person, I know and I just talk to him (Obviously not about the problems I might be facing) or in other words this guy is not my "close friend" but we talk as "so called friend". (Can I say we are professionals??? ). The other option is to ask a friend of mine who has already given me more than 1000 bucks for my mess bill (which was given long back say 2 years back) and has not yet asked for that as he knwos that I wil retrun him one day.
I can straight away go to the later one and ask for money without thinking ne crap like illustrated here and their is no chance that this guy wil not give me money ( I meant, If he has, he wil give for sure) and most importantly I have to still retrun him 1000 instead of 1005.
What if I ask the former person for 5 bucks instead of the later personality? I again have almost full chance of getting the money but with an unsaid warning of owing the responsibility of returning it. If I dont return it, I wont b goin to jail but whenever I and this guy face each other, I ll (I think I ll) feel awkward!
I took that money for my personal use, I should retrun it. Being a professional I have to retrun it. If its a personal affair, I may not have to retrun it.
My friend will never ask money back, neither I ask money back from my friends but what if this is not a matter of 5 bucks, The matter is different (obviously something with higher value, may be something that cant be measured in terms of currency ) but the options remain the same. Do you human think that the later person is a good choice? I think the former should be the choice not only because you should be professional, but also "you should not loose your friends". You ask for help on second matter to a friend of yours and being a friend your friend tries to help you out and in return (in case) u cannot return!! The bond from ionic may turn to covalent depending upon your friend.
So Be Professional everywhere...

This is Aman...

ZeeK has gone crazy! I dont think I got any mental problems nowadays! Infact I feel the actual Aman is coming out of me, day by day, as I shout on some1 (the entity some1 ) I feel more of myself. From past few years I think I tried to modify myself but the original nature of mine is best suited for me. I think being short tempered is not bad at times.
Mr. ZeeK ... How can you be Professional to your GirlFriend / BoyFriend ????
Now that would be cheating.
I dont have ne "so called girlfriend" but i dont think that even if I have one in coming future (fortunately), I wil maintain a professional relationship rather than a personal relatinoship. I am not going to choose a girlfriend who wants me to be professional for instance, If I have a GF and she is my GF bcz I am a good teacher then I dont think that this will work out!..Their cant be professionalism involved here atleast!

What if your 5 bucks crap has two options as a gal whom you just know and the second one is your girlFriend ????
Ha! Be Professional and search for other girlfriend! *(depends on your gal although)

To be continued,...
Maabdaulat: I am gonna continue the topic "Every Thing can be justified"
Shut Up And Bleed You Mother Fuc-!
Out in Utah the last few days working on the game. Some cool pics with a Sweet Tooth mask :)


Me and Scott Campbell (Eat Sleep Play co-founder/co-pres) posing with our boy's head. My understanding is a former Incognito employee made this for his Halloween costume back in the day. But this was the first time I'd ever seen it. It's so dang cool!


Me, being a dork :)



Me as dork, Part II :)

               
Close up of the mask. Nice detail!!!

Great weekend ya'll! I'm stuck inside tomorrow doing more work for our game. But I don't mind- game is going well so it's fun to keep cranking :). Plus, I'll spend a little time with War/Darksiders. Yes, I am STILL trying to finish it. I thought I was gonna do it last weekend but a little game called GOD OF WAR III hit my inbox and I played that all weekend (finished it too!...when is the last time I finished a game in 1-2 days?!? Probably it was ICO back in tha day!)...

Ok...take it easy, ya'll!

GOD OF WAR III THOUGHTS SO FAR...
Playing GOD OF WAR 3 this weekend and really, really loving it.


But it being a great game aside, it is an AMAZING and RARE game design learning opportunity. To play a game based on your initial design formula that you had nothing to do with is eye opening! Because for the first time, I can actually see how the game/God Of War formula feels to a normal player! Before this, I could only go off reviews and player reactions and guesses in terms of gauging just what the game really was and how it felt to play. You can try to imagine that experience when you make the game but since you know it so intimately, you never really know what it feels like for a normal member of the audience. You never know how others are actually experiencing it. Now I get to see and know and experience that! What a very cool learning opportunity! 


I'll post my final thoughts on the game when I finish it (and once it's been out a bit) but I can say now that visually and production wise, I really don't think there has EVER been a game that has executed at this level! Presentation and production wise, this is a crazy ass bar raising simply staggering game! And the execution of the story telling process? Fucking fantastic (amazing opening credits)! Amazing job all around! NOTE: Not suggesting he new GOW doesn't add and change the formula- that's up to you to determine- I am just saying the original formula is still present as well and that is what I am talking about.
2. The lines between software, content and media are blurring. This has profound implications on system architecture and revenue models. There will be a prevalence of loosely connected services and MashUps versus tightly integrated software. Your system architecture and design has to accommodate that. We are seeing this today in the growing prevalence of SOA and S+S models (wikipedia these terms!).

3. The above fact fundamentally shifts the revenue model for applications. If your app is made up of disjointed heterogeneous services and content sourced (on-demand) from various entities, there is no longer a basis for a pre-determined cost for the service. The pricing and in turn, the revenue model will now rely on a lot of other factors such as usage, relevance and the all important "Advertising", especially if it will reduce the cost of the service to the consumer.

4. Like it or not, advertising is going to be the major revenue source for the new breed of internet based applications - it is a win win for both the parties (consumers and advertisers): The advertisers now see much better returns on their investments since they are reaching their ideal target demographic due to the self-selecting nature of the application and audience. The consumers are happy because a. their costs for use of the application or resource is subsidized or often completely free and b. they are served relevant advertisements for products and services that they may ACTUALLY be interested in given the context.
What Traveling Has Taught Me About Money

Today’s guest post is from Kyle at OnOurOwnPath, who has been traveling with his wife for over 2 years with no plans of stopping.  If you wonder how they do it, read on…



Before my wife and I started being nomads, we weren’t really budget people. For instance, my idea of a budget would be looking at my checking account to make sure that it was above $0. Money came in, money went out. I didn’t really know where my money was going to half the time, I just new that I was being paid twice a month and that covered just about everything.

All of this changed, though, when we decided that we wanted to do extended world travel. Obviously, we would need the funds to start doing this, so we started saving money to be able to travel the world. And once we had this money saved, we didn’t want to go about blowing it on every thing that seemed like a good idea. If we did that, our trip would only last a few months.

So, we started being one of those people who keeps a meticulous budget. You know the type. We write down everything and then record it in a special budget spreadsheet complete with pie charts. Even when we pay 10 cents to use the toilet in Ecuador, we write it down. We then play with the numbers to see how much money we have left and what we could possibly do with it. Yes, we play with spreadsheets for fun.

The funny thing is that this is not a natural part of our personalities. Truthfully, I don’t think we could have done this if it weren’t for traveling. One of the unexpected side effects of being on the road has been what we’ve learned about our money.

Comfort is not expensive

We’re not the kind of super cheap travelers who sleep in a cockroach-infested hotel. Don’t get me wrong, we’ve stayed in places that I wouldn’t recommend to my parents, but we try to sleep in places that at least try to appear nice. What we’ve found, though, is that a little extra money goes a long way. For instance in Copacabana, Bolivia we stayed in an immaculate room overlooking Lake Titicaca that we would normally find out of our price range. To compensate for the extra cost while we were there, we decided to spend less money on doing “tourist” activities such as tours and more time just walking around and getting to know the area. As a result, we felt like we got to know the town better and had a wonderful time in the process. Of course, it also doesn’t hurt to wake up to the views of Lake Titicaca every morning.

On the contrary, we’ve also stayed in name-brand plush hotels which cost about 2-3 times a decent mid-range option. And what have we gotten for the extra price? So far, the only advantage that I can find for staying in plush hotels is that they give away better quality shampoo.

Spending should match priorities

Having a budget is all about making decisions. With only a limited amount of money to spent, we can’t do everything we want to do all the time. This makes us evaluate what our priorities are and spend our money according to these priorities. One of our priorities while traveling is to understand different cultures and interact with people in those cultures. So, accordingly, we try to spend our money on things that meet this priority instead of spending it on doing things like adventure activities, like white water rafting. We enjoy those activities as well, but it doesn’t compare to the 3 weeks of learning Spanish and living with a local family in Xela, Guatemala. Having the human connections with our host family and the ongoing connections that we made by speaking Spanish have far outweighed any eye candy that we’ve come across.

A Little Dose of Perspective Helps

If we’ve learned nothing else from traveling, it’s a sense of perspective. It’s hard for us to justify buying anything expensive when we know that the average Nicaraguan family could live off of that money for months. Just the fact that we can afford to even go to these places to see how other people live indicates that we’re not exactly strapped for cash.

So, when we do buy things, we try to buy them with our needs in mind. In the Andes of Ecuador, I needed to buy some long sleeves. Instead of trying to find a North Face store, for instance, I opted to get a locally made sweater less for than $10. Sure, the bright green fabric clashed with the rest of my clothes, but it served me well during my time in the high altitude.

Over the past 2 years on the road I can now say that being a budget-minded person is second nature for us. No matter where our path takes us, this habit will stick. It’s now apart of the fabric of who we are.

When it comes down to it, budgeting is truly not that hard when you can see the truly wonderful things that a little money can do. And we have travel to thank for allowing us to see that.
Each New Year, we wish others happiness and prosperity. What really is the sign of prosperity? There are several – a smile, contentment, freedom, the willingness to share, fearlessness and the trust and confidence that you will get what you need in life. Welcome the New Year with a genuine smile. As you flip the calendar, keep flipping your mind as well. Don’t fill your future dates with past events. Learn and unlearn from the past, and move on. You want to be free of greed, hatred, jealousy and all such imperfections. Understand that negative emotions are due to the past. Do not let the past affect your life in the present. If you cannot forgive the past, then your future will be miserable. This New Year make up with someone with whom you are not on good terms. Start life afresh. In the New Year, wish peace and prosperity for all. Do selfless service. Live your life well. Realise that your priority is to check violence in the world, free of domestic and societal violence. Make a resolution to do more good, help people in need and bring solace to those suffering. Whenever you are useful to people, merit will never be lost. Any good gesture or action of yours will always come back to you. Today you have the whole world for a family. That’s what you need to feel, that everybody is part of your own family. Take responsibility. Then there is no suffering. The spiritual dimension of life brings a great sense of belongingness, responsibility, compassion and caring for the whole world, for all life. In its truest form spirituality helps us overcome narrow boundaries of caste, creed, religion and nationality and gives you a broader awareness of life everywhere.Open your eyes and see how much you have been given. Focus on what you have rather than what you don’t have. The more grateful you are, the more will be given to you. Conversely, the more you complain, the more will be taken away from you. This is what Jesus Christ meant when he said, “Those who have will be given more; those who don’t give, and even what they have will be taken away from them.” With gratitude, reach out and help those who are less endowed. You will get much contentment when you serve selflessly. Then you realise that your problems aren’t so big after all. The biggest reason for mental depression is the constant refrain of the mind that says, “What about me?” This is a sign of lack of prosperity. Become free like a bird. Open your wings and learn to fly. This is something you have to experience within yourself. If you think you are in bondage, you will remain bound here. Be free. When will you experience freedom? After you die? Become free right now. Sit down and become contented. Spend some time in meditation and satsang. This not only calms your mind, your inner self becomes strong enough to deal with challenges. When the mind relaxes, the intellect becomes sharp. When the mind is loaded with ambitions and feverish desires, then the intellect loses its keenness. When intellect and observation are not sharp, life does not express itself fully. Ideas don’t flow properly and abilities diminish day by day. With this understanding, you step out of your narrow confines and that will solve many of the problems in your life. When you are centred, there is happiness always. With this calmness, talents arise naturally. Intuition comes, beauty comes, peace comes; Love springs up. Prosperity comes.
Getting Motivated
Posted by Scott on Mar 12, 2010 in Marketing
Today I am presenting you with the opportunity for motivation. Opportunity may knock, but it’s never going to beat down the door with a battering ram, so you better be listening for the knock. I am going to ask you give yourself a motivational test today, and once a week for the next month. This is opportunity knocking and I need you to be motivated enough to open the door and let it in. Now you know in your mind that the opportunity that’s knocking will require you to work, right? Don’t play the “I’m going to play like no one is home” routine because opportunity will not come back to you again. Getting motivated to do something is not an easy task, and for many of us it does not come naturally. Would it be easier for you if I gave you some atta-boy’s right off the bat? You are a valuable photographer. People in your community place a lot of value in your work. When your clients think of their most valuable possession in their home, the art and memories that you created for them are at the top of their list. OK ego’s stroked enough because my wrist is getting tired… Seriously now the word “value” is an important description of you and your work. The more valuable you are to your clients the more money you get to earn. Notice the word “earn” You are earning a living as a photographer.  I am always preaching about identifying your top clients and getting into their networks of family and friends.  Well this time I want you to identify the top clients of yours that really believe in your value to them.  They are going to be your best evangelists.  Many photographers have developed a wishbone where  there spine is supposed to be.  I wish, I wish, I wish… but never an “I really put my back into it and worked hard to accomplish ______”  Too much wishy washy crap going on in our industry.  If you want to stroke something three times and make a wish I’ll give you something to stroke… Probably not the results your hoping for though.  You are never going to win an award for mediocrity so stop trying to.  Look for client trends in your studio.  Where are my best clients from?  Who sent them?  Where can I reach more people like them? I am telling you this stuff works, but it takes some effort at first but trust me it will become effortless in the future.  Every day I hear from photographers that are struggling in this industry but 95% of them are like the fat guy ordering a Big Mac and a Diet coke but wondering why he is not loosing weight.  Working on yourself first and your business second will get you so much further in life.  You are the tool, and the business is what you create with that tool. (not to be confused with “you are a tool” that’s something else)  Being motivated will allow you to focus and accomplish so much more with your business.   Here is the simple test, print this out and keep it on your desk.
If I were motivated to improve my life, I would be more ______________________ (insert answer) Fit, reliable, happy, successful, etc…. Insert as many as you want.  Put the most important ones first.
If I were motivated to improve my life, I would have more ____________________
If I were motivated to improve my life, my business would be more _________________________
If I were motivated to improve my life, what could I offer to others that I’m not offering now ______________________
I will commit myself to being happier and more motivated.
I will take specific actions in my life towards obtaining the items listed above.
I wish no more…. This week I will complete __________________ (Insert a task you have been wanting to do) 
Join me on our 30 days for change.  Fill this out once a week and see if some of your answers change or move positions in the lists.   (your weekly tasks better change)    I know many of you have tons of things that you have been putting off doing, that you know you need to do.  You spend more time thinking about not doing those tasks than it probably actually takes just to do them.  I’m not just preaching to the choir here I too need to get my act in gear on several things that I keep putting off because I’m not motivated to complete them.  I am highly motivates towards certain things, but I have an unmotivated bag that I seem to carry around.  I keep putting crap in it that I don’t want to do until it’s full and I can’t close it anymore.  It’s my man purse!  (metaphorically speaking of course) and it’s filled with a bunch of little things that I am going to do.  I don’t know if this will inspire anyone or if it was just good for me to put this challenge out there.  Redefine your life right now.  What do you want and how do your want it?  Now how are you going to get it?  A race is never won if you never take the first step.  Today is your first step…. Maybe you won’t win but I hope you at least reach the finish line. 
I want you to be a quitter!  Some people say never quit, never give up… Blah blah blah….  Quit procrastinating, quit smoking, quit eating crap, quit thinking negativly, quit all kinds of bad stuff and start replacing it with the good stuff. 
I can’t light a fire under anyone to get them motivated, they have to pull out their wick and light it themselves.  I can pass the lit match to you, but you have to take it from there.  Now go lite your little wick.
had a very enjoyable debate with Avner Rosen of Boxee yesterday at SXSW.  We tended to go around in circles defending our positions. His (to paraphase): the internet will do what cable and satellite do, but it will do it better. That MicroSoft and Apple among others will in the future come up with new ways to do it all better than we can now.

Mine: Of course the internet can support video, but it cant do it as well as the current digital cable and satellite distributors can, nor is there a profit model that would ever incent content providers to switch their content from the internet to TV.

I wont rehash it all here, but the most salient comment came from the audience when someone asked “Whats the difference if the gatekeeper MicroSoft/Google/Apple rather than Comcast/Time Warner/Directv/Dish ?”

Of course the questioner was right.

Bits are bits . The economics of content are going to search for the best place to be monetized, regardless of the delivery platform.  I think the current model will be the place content finds, Avner seemed to feel it would be some future internet.

It shouldn’t matter.

We both seemed to agree that one of the biggest future changes for the internet will be an increase in bandwidth. The question the needs to be answered is “how will all the new bandwidth, both on the backbone and in the last mile be used ?”
Osama going Green!  Al Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden has called in a new audiotape for the world to boycott American goods and the US dollar, blaming the United States and other industrialized countries for global warming.
In the tape, Bin Laden warns of the dangers of Climate change and says that the way to it is to bring "the wheels of the American economy" to a halt.

Wow! So now the "World's Most Wanted" man is also talking about Global Warming - now that sounds interestingly ironical to me. He is the same person who masterminded the 9/11 attacks, killing around 3000 people!! He has also been linked with numerous terrorist activities across the world. So is it right on his part to talk about Global Warming?

Showing concern for the future generations after all the atrocities that he has committed in the past... talk about hypocrisy...

Everything said, i am quite excited about doing an intensive research on global warming in quest for its authenticity. Expect a post on it latest by Monday.

I set out to write an article about the unique features of XNA Game Studio on Windows Phone 7 Series, but while trying to populate my outline, I realized, wow, there actually aren’t many things different about Game Studio 4.0 on the phone compared to Windows and Xbox 360! That’s bad news for this article, but I think good news for our platform as a whole. With Game Studio 4.0, we made a concerted effort to increase portability and consistency across our target platforms.

In some areas it was obvious how to achieve consistency. For instance, Windows Phone 7 Series includes a Zune media client, so we could port our existing Zune media APIs. Input is similarly straightforward. If you only want to access a single touch point, you can use our existing Mouse API. If you need multitouch (the phone supports four simultaneous touches), you can use an API similar to what we previously shipped for Zune HD. This touch API works on Windows 7 PCs with multitouch displays, too.

Other areas, especially graphics, were more challenging to design. Had we just ported the Game Studio 3.1 graphics API, we would have been left with a confusing mess of non-overlapping caps that would make it hard to port code between Windows, Xbox, and the phone. But we didn’t want to force a lowest common denominator approach: it would make no sense to limit Xbox 360 games to only those features which are also available on mobile hardware!
Action Life is all about our own actions.

Actions are , "each and every" thing we do.Actions are the result of composition of different things, such as "Condition", "Choice" , " Habit", which favour the final action. Every individual action depends upon these three things. People will do the things if its their habit, or if the condition is favouring them to do so or if its the choice they have made for themselves for their good. So one person can admire you and another can be a person who treats you bad, or irritates you, does something wrong, will be considered as a bad person. But he is acting according to his condition, habit and mostly choice. According to him he is as good as Shri Rama in Ramayana. So all good and bad things are perspective.

Every thing in this world depends upon the action. One's action can create some condition for another. One can regret about his own action. For doing any action, condition cant be changed , habit can only be change forcefully, but one can make right choice in perspective of everyone so that there will be no need of regretting for our own action.well, in the end I want to say that I was thinking to write a blog from long time which is turned into "action", because I was dying to ... ;) another factor of edmitting an action ;)
No matter what you think of Twitter, you can't ignore the stats and the adoption rates and all those unique view statistics that you can find on Mashable. It's a growing phenomenon that is moving so fast that it can give you whiplash. Yes, Twitter is now up to about 14 million Unique views in the month of March. Anything with this much momentum and views is a gold-mine. So what's up with Twitter for me? I have been able to come across the most diverse and unique data when using search.twitter.com. This is a very different search engine when compared to google search. It's a way to scrape for keywords in the twittersphere, a sampling of what people are talking about at the moment vs. data mining tons of html that is quickly becoming out of date. If I'm attending GDC, I'm not going to search google for "GDC '09" and expect to find out what is going on right now. Immediately I reach for search.twitter.com. or to shipping Dead Space we provided a bunch of "pre-released" copies of the game to certain people in the industry. I started searching twitter for "dead space" and utilizing the results. I would get things like "@jimmygameplayer I've just started playing Dead Space and will hope to have a review soon."
5. TRAFFIC is critical. Due to the earlier point, scale becomes much more important - if you are an advertiser, wouldn't you rather go to the vendor that has aggregated a lot more content and traffic than a relatively smallish site (unless of course it is a niche site and you are in that market)? Therefore, we see the emergence all sorts of sites and services such as technorati, digg, etc. that do not product produce any substantial content on their own, but serve to index and aggregate the other content on the web to drive traffic to their sites. Seen in this context, the Microsoft Yahoo merger makes a lot of sense. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! accounted for 15.6% of all U.S. Internet visits for the week ending Jan. 26. In the same period, Google's share was 7.7%.

6. Relevance drives Traffic. Web search engines are the ultimate example of this fact. Often, the most advertising dollars go to those services that can accurately and comprehensively aggregate and serve out relevant resources to consumers. Relevance drives traffic, relevant traffic drives advertising, advertising drives revenue. Revenue drives profits. Profits mean that you can kick back and sip pina coladas without having to work 80 hour weeks and read blogs like this one!!
Auto Mafia - A report from the Indian Express.  Ever wondered as to why the Dilli autowallah's overcharge so much? I happen to stumble on this article in the Indian Express which explores the existence of auto-mafia in Delhi. Its an eye-opener.

THE Centre's Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) wants the Supreme Court to lift its 12-year-old freeze on granting fresh permits to auto-rickshaws.
The EPCA believes this ban has `pushed' the public transport system into the hands of the financier mafia.

On September 16, 1997, the Supreme Court had ordered that only 55,000 autos could run on Delhi's roads. A new vehicle could only be introduced as a replacement. In such cases, the permit passes on from the old to the new.

Since permits are so much in demand, original permit holders have begun to sell them to financiers and middlemen.These men,who have formed a cartel and dominate the auto market,sell the vehicle and the accompanying permit for a premium. While the showroom price of an auto is Rs 1.25 lakh, the financiers charge Rs 4.5 lakh.

The vicious cycle continues.

The owner rents out the auto at a high price to the driver, who then ends up overcharging customers. The EPCA -set up in 1998 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to monitor pollution levels -made its observations on the auto scenario in its 34th report, presented on Friday before the apex court's Special Bench of three judges, headed by Chief Justice of India K G Balakrishnan.
The EPCA stated: "Removal of the cap will help eliminate the dominating hold of the `financier mafia' who are exploiting not only the auto drivers but also the general public by pushing up artificially the capital cost of three wheelers, and hence the operational cost." If more autos are allowed to ply, an owner can bypass financiers and directly approach the government for a permit. "The financiers buy the TSRs (autos) and farm them out. There is no information as to the owner or the driver," senior advocate and amicus curiae Harish Salve, who presented the report before the court, said on Friday.

The committee's findings were arrived at after a series of consultations with the Delhi government's Transport department, the Delhi Police, associations and manufacturers of three-wheelers, the Delhi government's Weights and Measures department, the Delhi Finance Corporation and the representatives of private financiers and the Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI).

The EPCA explained how the mafia-controlled TSR transport mechanism has led to an increase in pollution levels too. "A bulk of the vehicles (TSRs)onroad are owned by a limited number of people who rent these to drivers on a charge of around Rs 250 to Rs 300for a night-hourshift.The driver pays for the CNG fuel and minor repairs, which adds to the tendency to cut costs," the committee said.

The EPCA report also mentions how growing traffic congestion eats into the daily bread of drivers, who are forced to lose their chance to drive the vehicle the next day if they do not earn a substantial daily amount.

The EPCA has also said that the `smart card' system -- a smart card would have replaced the permit and carried detailed information on the owner and driver of an auto - has failed to takeoff.Repeated ads and public announcements elicit no response, the EPCA states.

"In spite of all the efforts of the Transport department to improve the registration database,the system is in bad shape.The addresses of(both owners and drivers)are not clear;ownership information is difficult to transcribe.It is alleged the ownership is concentrated in the hands of the financier mafia," the committee said.

The EPCA recommended the cap on autos be removed so that the government can develop TSRs as "intermediate public transport vehicles" meant to provide "last-mile connectivity" to commuters in the city.

GOD should have been an Engineer!! -   The World and The Software Developmnet Life Cycle!!

God made this world in 5 days.... Ever wondered how??


If God was able to make us and everything else in 5 days, why do software engineers have to devote so much time in developing a simple system which is infinitesimally small compared to this planet?

"GOD , for one , did not have any installed base to worry about upward integration and compatibility . No platform dependency.....

and I'm guessing he skipped most part of documentation also....."

No wonder He ended up with such a mess.

Maybe if GOD had followed SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), maybe the earth woul have been a better place to live in.

P.S : I'm also sure that GOD used some Open Source Technology under the EULA Liscencing and the copyleft standards which explains so many versions of the same species all around us!! ;-)

Well, GOD should have taken Computer Science Engineering. And if he did take it... he should have paid attention in class.

So.... Now gotta get back to work... have to complete the documentation for my project... bye!!!
Pretend to be a Time Traveler Day: this Weekend!
Thursday, September 10th, 2009
Howdy folks, I know it’s a little late notice but PTTBATTD has moved to September 12, though I think we’ll still have a December iteration as in previous years.  If you live in Portland, OR, though, you’re in for a treat! I’ve teamed up with Drunken Rampage and they’ve organized a fantastic even this Saturday where we time travelers will be dominating a good section of Northwest.  Everyone’s invited to participate; we’ve got some great challenges and events lined up, as well as a good few bars to hide out in after the normals are spooked.  Also, there will be several time traveler tour groups, one of which will be led by yours truly.

If this sound interesting, check out the site for more details.  Even if you’re not in Portland, you are encouraged to pretend to be a time traveler wherever you might confuse people.  For new folks, here are the classical rules:

Pretend to be a Time Traveler Day

You must spend the entire day in costume and character. The only rule is that you cannot actually tell anyone that you are a time traveler. Other than that, anything’s game.

There are three possible options:

1) Utopian/cliché Future - “If the Future did a documentary of the last fifty years, this is how badly the reenactors would dress.” Think Star Trek: TNG or the Time Travelers from Hob. Ever see how the society in Futurama sees the 20th century? Run with it. Your job is to dress with moderately anachronistic clothing and speak in slang from varying decades. Here are some good starters:

- Greet people by referring to things that don’t yet exist or haven’t existed for a long time. Example: “Have you penetrated the atmosphere lately?” “What spectrum will today’s broadcast be in?” and “Your king must be a kindly soul!”

- Show extreme ignorance in operating regular technology. Pay phones should be a complete mystery (try placing the receiver in odd places). Chuckle knowingly at cell phones.

2) Dystopian Future - This one offers a little more flexibility. It can be any kind of future from Terminator to Freejack. The important thing to remember is dress like a crazy person with armor. Black spray painted football pads, high tech visors, torn up trenchcoats and maybe even some dirt here or there. Remember, dystopian future travelers are very startled that they’ve gone back in time. Some starters:

- If you go the “prisoner who’s escaped the future” try shaving your head and putting a barcode on the back of your neck. Then stagger around and stare at the sky, as if you’ve never seen it before.

- Walk up to random people and say “WHAT YEAR IS THIS?” and when they tell you, get quiet and then say “Then there’s still time!” and run off.

- Stand in front of a statue (any statue, really), fall to your knees, and yell “NOOOOOOOOO”

- Stare at newspaper headlines and look astonished.

- Take some trinket with you (it can be anything really), hand it to some stranger, along with a phone number and say “In thirty years dial this number. You’ll know what to do after that.” Then slip away.

2) The Past - This one is more for beginners. Basically dress in period clothing (preferably Victorian era) and stagger around amazed at everything. Since the culture’s set in place already, you have more of a template to work off of. Some pointers:

- Airplanes are terrifying. Also, carry on conversations with televisions for a while.

- Discover and become obsessed with one trivial aspect of technology, like automatic grocery doors. Stay there for hours playing with it.

- Be generally terrified of people who are dressed immodestly compared to your era. Tattoos and shorts on women are especially scary.
What to do! After meeting lots of people  in last few days i came to some conclusion. In this professional world that we all "live" in, the cut throat competition that we have been exposed to, has made our lives so miserable that it needs immediate attention. Moreover, the irony is, no one seems to be alarmed. With this viscious cycle continuing there is virtually no future! or atleast nothing that i can think of.

This mad mad race, winning at all cost,  is taking a hefty toll on one's own personal life as well. People are less happy with what they are getting and more sad for what other are getting!! I mean one should be concerned about him/her self more then the others.

Sad some of my few friends have also got this virus, i am trying hard to explain to them that please do not get into all this. Life is different and do not mess it up just by living it how others wanted you to. Don't live somebody else's life!

Sad...but true...many people have no idea what they will be doing tomorrow? Leave tomorrow they don't have idea about today!!
1. They appear different to different eyes:

Visit two homes, perhaps in the same street, in which there is similar trouble—sickness, or bereavement, or failure in business, or sore poverty. In one, all is gloom, repining, comfortless perplexity. In the other, there is light in the darkness, a rainbow on the storm.

To one sufferer God’s ways are hard, dark, mysterious; he is even ready to think them unjust. The other says, “I could not bear it in my own strength, but the Lord stands by me and strengthens me. God’s will must be right. He cannot make mistakes or be unfaithful. He is my Refuge and Strength.” So with God’s government of the world and general providence. One mind fastens on the pain, sorrow, calamity, which every hour records—pestilence, earthquake, tempest, and so forth. Another sees that the universal design and general working of all natural laws is for good and happiness, not evil; that the main part of human suffering has its root in sin; that “the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord;” and trusts God for the rest.

2. God’s dealings not only appear different; they are and must be different, according to the temper and attitude of our souls. To the soul that bows under God’s hand, trusts his Word, clings closer to him in trial, it is “chastening”—full of mercy, rich in result (Heb. 12:6, etc.). The proud, stubborn heart, that resents and rebels against affliction, is hardened by it, like Pharaoh.
When I was in Barcelona with SIME on May 21, I had the chance to meet a veteran, well acclaimed journalist, Jennifer L. Schenker who is one of the industry’s most respected commentators with over 30 years working for leading publications like TIME Magazine, the International Herald Tribune and Red Herring. Since less than a year she runs her own venture, Informillo.com. And she claimed that bloggers are not journalists. She felt journalism is more about reporting facts and connecting information together without any personal bias, and blogging involves more of the personal factor, and is most of the times personal opinion more than information per se. Some how I felt that bloggers are journalists too since news events are first broken out in the blogs (and micro blogs now) too, and generally digg which could be a decent indicator of things that are on the top of the web mesh for the day predominantly features blogs along with news sites. And when you dig deeper, the word journalist encompasses both a columnist and a reporter. So probably blogging is all about being a columnist, but what happens if you include video bloggers? They interview people and spread information / news too. The intersection between traditional and new media is a grey area, and at least the pundits of the English language would not be a great fan of the cross pollination of the terms and usage.
The American tradition of tinkering -- the spark for inventions from the telephone to the Apple computer -- is making a comeback, boosted by renewed interest in hands-on work amid the economic crisis and falling prices of high-tech tools and materials.

The modern milling machine, able to shape metal with hairbreadth precision, revolutionized industry. Blake Sessions has one in his dorm room, tucked under the shelf with the peanut butter on it.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology junior has been using the mill to make prototypes for a bicycle-sprocket business he's planning. He bolts down a piece of aluminum plate, steps to his desk and, from his computer, sets the machine in motion.
Tinkering With Technology

Jason Euren, an anthropology student at the New School University in Manhattan, worked with a soldering kit at the Brooklyn hackerspace Resistor recently.

"It's kind of a ridiculous thing to have," says Mr. Sessions, 20 years old. But "in today's marketplace you can't only offer a technical aptitude. You have to be able to provide something more."

Occupying a space somewhere between shop class and the computer lab, the new tinkerers are making everything from devices that Twitter how much beer is left in a keg to robots that assist doctors. The experimentation is even creating companies. With innovation a prime factor in driving economic growth, and corporate research and development spending tepid, the marriage of brains and brawn offers one hopeful glimmer.
Another marriage ruined by the gays

Clearly gays getting married in other states has ruined Charlie's marriage to the point that he is not even interested in spending his anniversary with his wife. This is why marriage equality must be stopped.

The Broward Palm Beach News has been checking in on political lovebirds Charlie Crist and Carole Rome:

A Crist-Miss Story: Florida's First Couple Celebrates First Anniversary... Separately:
Crist still followed through with the marriage, of course, but in the year since, the pair have rarely been seen together. Most recently, Crist spent the evening of their first anniversary in Palm Beach's Mar-a-Lago at a March of Dimes fundraiser, with wife Carole nowhere in sight, according to page2live.com.

This after a year in which Rome bounced between visits to her kids in New York and her home on Fisher Island, while Crist stayed in Tallahassee or his home in Tampa Bay. Remember, Crist worked right through the couple's honeymoon.

But come on! The first anniversary? You two aren't even trying anymore. And why should you? If Crist is gay -- or if he's just a commitment-phobic straight guy who likens Burger King funnel cake sticks to a 'beignet' -- he shouldn't feel political pressure to get married.

The Women

Whether it's Suzanne Craig, Silda Spitzer or Darlene Ensign, it surprises me that the women married to these men stand behind them. I am no expert in heterosexual marriage, but I imagine the pain finding out your husband likes to have sex in bathroom stalls with men in train stations and airports ranks up there with experiencing divorce.

As the late Rodger McFarlane said says in Outrage: "I know what they have to say in public and I actually kind of admire them for being able to give that performance, I'm sure I couldn't. But, that's some wierd shit."

Jenny Sanford wouldn't take the role.

South Carolina's first lady files for divorce - washingtonpost.com:
The wife of embattled South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) announced Friday morning she is filing for divorce, saying in a statement that she decided to dissolve her marriage after 'many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation.'
It’s well into 2008 and another US election is around the corner, and therefore, like any other dutiful blog in the blogosphere, it is my duty to comment on it despite the fact that I neither have the knowledge nor the perspective to comment. And therefore, that makes me perfectly qualified to author the “Dummies’ guide to the US elections”. American elections are important to the world because we never know where they are going to drop bombs next, and a close analysis of media chatter is necessary to figure out if one’s country is in some sort of “axis of evil”. So let’s get right down to the key issues at stake, shall we? All US elections are fundamentally about left vs right. The Democrats are Left (usually licking their wounds), and the Republicans are Right (in the thick of stealing elections). The Democrats believe that it’s right that the rest of the world is best left alone. The Republicans believe that they have the right to invade what’s left of the world. In the interest of brevity, for the rest of the post, the Democrats shall be referred to as Ds (as in Docile Donkeys), and the Republicans shall be referred to Rs (as in Rogue Elephants).  The Ds want to kill babies. The Rs prefer to kill women. Ds are anti-business and the Rs are anti-worker. Ds talk about securing jobs while outsourcing the manufacturing of “Obama-Biden” bumper stickers to China. Rs talk about securing America while outsourcing the torture of prisoners to other countries. Ds believe that gay marriages between man and animal are OK. Rs believe that not-so-gay marriages between priests and young boys are OK. Ds don’t believe in family values. Rs believe strongly in family values such as the sanctity of marriage and abstention, as long as one is not a former prisoner of war or a 20-month old Alaskan governor. Ds are best described as a pluralized slang term for cats lacking patriotism while Rs are best described as people with scarlet shading in the neck area indulging in ugly jingoism. Ds believe in bombing the hell out of places where there is a faint suspicion of the presence of a man named OBL. Rs believe in bombing the hell out of places where there is a whiff of this thing called OIL. Ds are like remixed dubchick Bob Dylan music. Rs are like country music. Ds prefer to save polar bears while making America energy starved. Rs will run their extra large SUVs on the fat of polar bears, if necessary. Ds are out-of-touch elites. Rs are rich old white people.  Ds want to take hard earned money from rich people and distribute it to poor, unproductive people. Rs want tax cuts for the rich and build gulags for factory workers. Ds are French. Rs have so many balls that it impedes their movement. Ds follow racist black priests. Rs are generally racist.  Ds have blogs. Rs have Fox news. Ds believe that the media has a conservative bias. Rs believe that it’s an evil liberal media out there. In reality, the US media, like any other, has a monetary bias. Thank you.
Section 11A of Aircraft Act, 1934 - Hello everybody.By seeing the title u must be thinking that I am a law student but to tell u I am not a student of law and i am not telling you about the fundamentals of INDIAN constitution.I just wanted to tell you that there was a violation of "Section 11A of Aircraft Act, 1934" which states that the aircraft organisation have to abide by the rules given by BCAS (Bureau Of Civil Aviation Security) and in its guidelines BCAS has stated that vip's/vvip's are exempted from security checks or frisking.

Well you must be thinking that am I a vip.ha ofcourse not.but our former president Mr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is a vvip and he was frisked and even asked to remove his shoes at IGI antional airport in New Delhi by security personnels of Continental Airlines(An U.S. based airlines).It was the boss of the airlines who made it necessary to be checked.Although you must be thinking that everyday many laws are broken why this in particular?because Mr. kalam is a role model for many of us and especially the student community.He represents INDIAN scientist community and frisking him is a fall of national pride .

Well it was a law which was broken in INDIA and it is not made internationally.There are greater offences than this one when we go in past .When George Fernandes was in ministry in NDA regime then he had to go security check in America when he was on an official visit there where as it is clearly stated that any minister from any country is exempted from security checks then why was it performed .It is not only one instance .Pranab mukherjee was coming back from France to India then also he has to go through security checks which is again unforgivable.I am great supporter for equality but then equality must not only be on papers it must be implemented.Checking our role models and people representing a country in name of the security is not permissible and even when it has been stated clearly.

Coming back to India a FIR has been registered against the employees concerned but i guess it will not do because they were only the people following orders the issue has to be taken to all the aircraft organisations and clear directives must be given to them and it must be cleared that if there is exemption then it must be applied for all and if there is not then everybody must be checked even a minister from any other country(but atithi devo bhava) .Security checks must be upgraded but not only for publicising it some concrete steps are to be followed other than just checking vvip's.
The Sad Death Of The Queen Of The Skies


When Zagat first started their consumer-driven restaurant guide, I was one of their very first reviewers. I ate out a lot-- and in a lot of cities. A few years ago they started another guide, one for airlines. I fly a lot too, and they asked me to be one of the initial reviewers. There are 6,000 reviewers now and tihs past year I once again voted for British Air as my favorite overall airline. That's probably the last time they'll be getting a positive score from me. For decades I've thought of them as the gold standard of high quality, professional service. I like Singapore and Virgin well enough and Cathay has been pretty good-- if headed in the wrong direction lately-- but all the airlines that are good, always seem to be imitating and trying to catch up with B.A. Those days are over.

B.A. is hurting. Financially they're a mess and abysmal management has driven the company into a hole they're not going to recover from witouth a complete managerial overhaul. Yesterday I flew from L.A. to Rome. Instead of it being the first fabulous part of a trip-- the way I've always considered flying on B.A. flights-- it was a horror show from beginning to end.

Early in the day, the flight attendants union voted to strike on December 21 and come back on January 2. When I called for advice about what to do to prevent myself from being stranded abroad, I could have been talking with someone from Delta, American or United or any airline that puts its customer service department through a rigorous training procedure on how to frustrate and infuriate customers. I spent well over an hour on hold and talking with two customer service clerks and in the end, got nowhere. They said that I could cancel my tickets but since the airline hadn't "officially" cancelled my flight home-- and probably wouldn't until I got to the airport in January-- it would cost me $250 to cancel. And I was lucky because I had purchased a refundable ticket!

I decided to take the gamble-- while the company's disastrous boss, Willie Walsh, postured and acted the tough anti-union thug in public-- and I was immediately sorry when I got on board the flight. Only one of the 3 restrooms was functioning in the business class cabin-- and it was in a sorry state of cleanliness right from the beginning. The whole cabin was in a shoddy condition in fact, way below the B.A. standards that have always attracted me to the airline. It looks like one of the cost savings was those paper toilet seat covers. The crew was the dregs, the sound system wasn't functioning enough to understand a word anyone ever said. And, the food was as bad as you can expect from a third-rate flying garbage truck. Poor British Air!

And poor me! The flight was late getting in and although I made it-- with a second or two to spare-- onto my connecting flight from London, my checked luggage didn't. It still hasn't. They claim it arrived in Rome but they seem to have lost it again. "Seem to," because communication is not a strong point. Last night I stayed in all night waiting for the promised bag; didn't even have dinner. But this morning-- still no idea where my bag is or when-- or even if-- I'll ever get it back.

As the Guardian put it today "the way Willie Walsh has handled this dispute will end up in the MBA textbooks-- as how not to do it. Just over two years ago, the BA boss hailed a new era in its often-troubled industrial relations. Now the atmosphere between management and workforce has become more poisonous than ever. Both sides risk sleepwalking into a strike that neither really wants. They should be forced-- by government if necessary-- to negotiate with each other. Carelessness is no excuse for destroying a business." Too late for that; they need to rid themselves of Walsh and get back to the days when they understood what it meant to build customer loyalty instead of contempt.
Singularity Summit: a brief review
Wednesday, October 7th, 2009
So this last weekend I was very privileged to be invited to attend the Singularity Summit in New York, an annual meeting of minds to discuss the implications of growing (and possible accelerating) technologies.  Now, despite having written a comic story about this very subject, I’ve never actually been in to an official gathering of these folks before, and didn’t really know what to expect.

Highlights:

- The audience was of a much higher caliber than what I expected.  Beforehand I had a lurking fear that Singularitarians were actually mostly navel-gazing sci-fi geeks who were more interested in a “nerd rapture” than the facts of emerging technologies.  In truth, it turns out that I was likely the dumbest guy in the room, with essentially all the attendees being very educated, thoughtful and (often) professionally successful individuals.  It was an interesting mix of industry leaders, scientists, economist and skeptics all possessing the necessary faculties for diverse and sober views concerning the subjects at hand.  Folks were friendly, too, and mingling in between talks I could always make my way into a group where interesting conversation was going on.

- The selection of speakers was very diverse.  I was concerned that the majority may involve a cheerleading squad for a particular view, but in fact topics and speakers ranged from those who believed in an inevitable “hard takeoff” Singularity to those who though *some* singularity was necessary to avoid existential risks to AI researchers who believed that belief in the Singularity is just a cognitive bias that futurists have.  Regardless of their views, though, every speaker treated the subject matter as a very serious and legitimate topic of discussion and investigation.

- Ray Kurzweil’s talks were very good as one might expect, though I personally felt these were some of the less exciting parts of the summit.  I don’t think it’s any fault of Kurzweil’s, though, since I’m just really familiar with his work and arguments, and it seems like he’s had to respond to the same tired arguments for several years now.  Two things that impressed me were the astonishing amount of evidence, detail and overall research he puts into his thesis (far more thorough than any other speakers) and second, the fact that he really looks a lot younger than a man in his 60s.  I know some folks take jabs at the astonishing amount of supplements and other dietary/medical steps he takes to increase his lifespan, but it really does seem to have an effect on his vitality and appearance.  He could easily be a good front man for the movement, though I noted that he wasn’t presented as such, and a variety of other speakers seemed to be pushed to the forefront instead.

- Eliezer Yudkowsky, as always, was very clever and humorous in his examination of cognitive bias and how downright insane human beings are really wired to be.  With a series of statistics (with the audience participating in some questions), he showed how even a “rational” person’s mind can be hacked primarily due to its messy “spaghetti code” evolutionary history.  Symptoms of cognitive bias include tending to believe more specific or dramatic threats over more realistic ones (examples included the Bush administration preparing for elaborate “movie threats” while ignoring statistically more likely and dangerous threats like hurricane disasters).  With relation to the Singularity, one popular fear is the “Terminator Scenario” where AI becomes violent, humanoid and bend on destroying the human race.  Despite having not even the slightest grounds in fact, this image is popular because it’s specific and dramatic.  Likewise, in regards to futurism in general, we tend to overestimate the macroscopic (flying cars, jet packs, space travel) and underestimate the advances of the subtle (internet, cloud computing, augmented reality, specific and general AI).

Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and venture capitalist, provided a very interesting perspective.  From the view of a technologist and businessman, he believes that the topic that needs to be discussed further is what happens if the Singularity doesn’t happen or doesn’t happen fast enough.  He seems to be of the opinion that if it doesn’t develop quickly enough, there could be an incident similar to the ‘dot com crash’ (where investors overestimated tech growth) only on a much larger, more devastating scale.  He argued that the Singularity has the potential to be an extremely beneficial trend in the future, but there needs to be a more concentrated economic and industrial effort to ensure that it develops the right way and at the right pace.

Aubrey de Grey may have been my favorite speaker, as the topic of biological longevity research is an area where my education is sorely lacking.  Some magnificent leaps and bounds in this field have been made, and Dr. de Grey graphed life expectancy paths (using only the most pessimistic predictions regarding advancements) amongst different age groups today.  It was a very thorough talk and, while seemingly optimistic, it involved some of the hardest, tangible science out there.  I feel this is one angle of Transhumanism that should get more face time in the public eye.  While AI is the more significant thing to watch in the long run (and the most terrifying), aging and longevity research is a very tangible, understandable science with a growing and continuous set of real-world applications that even the harshest cynic couldn’t call useless.  On top of that, Dr. de Gray really does come off as a very charming, thoughtful person who is genuinely interested in helping everyone he can (at the expense of perhaps his own longevity).

-Another interesting observation is that half the freaking people at the summit read Dresden Codak. Why on Earth would such important individuals waste their time on this comic is beyond me, but it was kind of neat.  Even though I was just an attendee, I’ve never gotten this much attention even at a comic show (on the second day I was even roped into giving autographs in the lobby!).  A definite highlight was when Aubrey de Grey pulled me aside to praise my satirical essay featuring Trans-Simianism. Who knew?

Conclusion: a wonderful group of intellectuals discussing a relevant and fascinating array of subjects, from autonomous cars to brain scans to curing blindness to avoiding being destroyed by a superintelligence.  Both the speakers and attendees are the type of people I wouldn’t mind seeing again at next year’s summit.  If you’re interested in the subject at all (from skeptic to optimist) and can afford the price of admission, it’s definitely an event worth seeing for yourself.

Holding Back the Rise of the Machines?
February 20th, 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang
Respond

Amazon’s Mechanical Turk is one of my favorite examples of leveraging the internet for innovation:

Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. The Mechanical Turk web service enables companies to programmatically access this marketplace and a diverse, on-demand workforce. Developers can leverage this service to build human intelligence directly into their applications.

But, in my view, Mechanical Turk does not take its vision far enough. In the conditions of use, Amazon makes it clear that only human participation need apply: “you will not use robots, scripts or other automated methods to complete the Services”.

On one hand, I can understand that Amazon’s vision for Mechanical Turk, like Luis Von Ahn’s “games with a purpose“, explicitly aims to apply human intelligence to tasks where automated methods seem inadequate. On the other hand, what are automated methods but encapsulations of human methods? It seems odd for Amazon to be so particular about the human / machine distinction, especially given that terms of service impose practically no other constraints on execution (beyond the obvious legal ones), Moreover, Mechanical Turk offers developers a variety of ways to assure quality (redundancy, qualification tests, etc.).

Granted, there are some important concerns that would have to be addressed if Amazon were to relax the “humans-only” constraint. For example, a developer today can reasonably assume that two different human “Providers” execute tasks independently. With automated participation, there’s a far greater risk of dependence–e.g., from multiple programmers applying the same algorithms. This possibility would have to be taken into account in quality assurance.

Still, the benefits of allowing automated participants would seem to far outweigh the risks. At pennies a task, Mechanical Turk has a limited appeal to the human labor force–indeed, research by Panos Ipeirotis suggests that Amazon’s revenue from the service may be so law that it doesn’t even cover the costs of a single dedicated developer!

In contrast, there’s evidence that programmers would take an interest in participation, were it an option. Marketplaces like TopCoder and competitions like the Netflix Prize suggest that computer scientists take an interest in proving their mettle in many of the kinds of tasks for which organizations already use Mechanical Turk.

So, why not give algorithms a chance? Surely we’re not that afraid of Skynet or the “technological singularity“. Let’s give machines–and their programmers–a chance to show off the best of both worlds!
Miss D loves her Dumbo soft toy, It pretty much goes everywhere with us. If she’s tired or grumpy then she needs that elephant and bedtimes are a non-starter if he’s not around… I know she’ll grow out of this phase so it doesn’t bother me, but my only stipulation is that Dumbo MUST have a wash on a regular basis to keep him vaguely fresh and clean. This requirement stems from a story my wife told me a while back. One of her cousins had the original “Linus from Snoopy” style security blanket, he could never be parted from it and would never allow it to be washed. You can imagine how gruesome this piece of fabric was; I’m sure if it were left alone long enough in a controlled environment, a whole new lifeform would have evolved from the fibres of this dribbly, snot-riddled abomination. So, with that image permanently engraved on my brain, every couple of weeks it’s bathtime for Dumbo and Miss D’s postpartum tantrums begin. It’s strange, she can leave him on the sofa and forget about him all afternoon while we’re doing something else but as soon as I pick him up she wants her elephant back.
Being Back...!!! So I am back...

Though I dont know why !!!
After having deleted my approx. 15 posts I thought I did a mistake.
For the few posts were really good enough not to be created again.

Yes few people belong to the catagory :Think & Think before committing.These people do nothing much
in life.Another class consists of people like me who do things in an emotional rage and repent for long if not entire life time as to why did they commit the "unwanted" act.I am still not sure as to which class is more blemish.Well let us not dwell into that.

Time has come to look things positively.I could easily end up my entire life in cigerrate smokes.But that is not the reason I am here for."Cigerrate can ruin you", have already been proved by few fanatics.

At the end of my life I may end up with a healthy bank balance, few friends ,and few relationships that do not exist as of now.So whats the big deal...???There are lacs of men who end up like that.....Got to make a difference in my life...
Spendind time in thinking over myself and my relationship with the things around me....

Got to write about this "exile" at TI-Banglore.There is no "Bang" and no "Glore" here.I long to return
back to my friends!!
This time I wont let the blogging habit dominate me!!

Distance make people grow fonder OR out of sight out of mind.Well differnt people have just vomited what they felt about various occasins in life....Never believe or follow any such stuff strictly.Use your own natural possessions!!!
WHY I LIKE HIM- Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or better known as APJ Abdul Kalam is known for his versatility.He has contributed a lot to India's development both as a president and as a scientist.He is a person who encourages youth,as he firmly believes that youth is the backbone of India.He is known for his quotes."Thinking is progress. Non-thinking is stagnation of the individual organisation and the country. Thinking leads to action. Knowledge without action is useless and irrelevant. Knowledge with action, converts adversity into prosperity."is one fine example. WHY I LIKE HIM- Shivaji Rao Gaekwad or better known as Rajinikanth is known for his hardwork and perseverance.Can you ever imagine a bus conductor turning into a celebrity who is known worldwide,and who has millions and millions practically chanting his name?Aint it far beyond our imagination..??Well yes, had Rajinikanth not been in this world.He is a person who is very well known for his hardwork and sets his life as an example for the same.He tells us clearly that "Appearance is not the only criteria one need to possess in oder to attract people".No wonder he is known across the globe.
Session with Bawa-n-Dinesh in Delhi on 21Jan'09  I am sure it must have happened sometime in your life, you are walking on the street, just passing a cake shop, and you slow down wondering whether you should give in to the temptation and indulge, you have almost decided not to, and a gentle breeze parcels a whiff of sweet aromatic air right into your nose! You almost taste the black forest with cherries or a wlanut almond or a pineapple watermelon with roasted cashew  toppings....yuummmmm....Now you are left with no choice. In the next couple of minutes you are walking out of the shop licking the melting chocolate off your fingers :-)

Bawa and Dinesh visited Delhi for a couple of days and all of the above happened, metaphorically and actually too! And their session on the 21st evening was like that - a gentle whiff packed with a lot of goodies.

Knowledge
Bawa said Guruji explained dispassion beautifully. He said, a desire to have any pleasurable experience springs up when you see or hear something about it. This desire or craving is called 'Trishna'. For e.g. till you have not heard about Bali, you had no desire to visit Bali.

Not giving in to the Trishna is 'Vairagya' (dispassion).

As we grow up our desires get mature and refined.

Q/A:
1. My dad has threatened me that if I go for the upcoming YES!+ in Simla, then I will have to leave him and my house for ever. I have already paid and registered. What should I do?

Bawa: Wow, thats great! Just say good bye and go to Simla. (laughter in the audience) If your dad really doesnt take you back home, then go to the ashram and do seva :-). Tell him when you feel like calling me back, just call me, ok, byeeee, Jai Guurdev ;-). Dont ask for permission from your dad, just tell him I am going and ask for blessings. Tell him that he has given you such good upbringing, which has made you capable of making the right decisions. Tell him there is nothing more I can ask from you dad, as you have already given me everything. The only thing you can give me now is blessings... (applause). 2. My mom becomes emotional and throws tantrums and blackmails me saying she will not talk to me if I do seva and do AOL activities.

Bawa: Never give in to the emotional blackmail of parents. Know that they love you intensely so they behave like that. Most of them do not have experience of hard core seva, so they do not understand the significance and depth of what you are doing.

Bau said you are so lucky you have parents who protest, who take so much interest in your life, who are bothered about you, who care to bother about you. Not every parent does that.

So when your parents crib, just feel grateful.

I forgot a few things, there were lot of rip-roaring laughter moments.


Bau made it sound so light and yet so profound when he said that may be Guruji has asked Delhi YES!+ to do the 1 lac people March on 28th Feb against terrorism and corruption (www.themarch.in) just to keep the volunteers busy or maybe it could lead to a very powerful transformation of our country.

And then Bau shared some funny and touchy Guru stories. I am not going tom take the effort to type all that. You missed it.

Love, Jai Gurudev
Saleel
Feel Good….!!! :) Recently i have seen a video which says abt the secret of life.... tat video has inspired me a lot..
This is wat all of the video is about...

One of the best feelings that one can enjoy is to Feel Good. Feeling Good gives all the good feelings one can experience in life...either could be .... happiness, joy, love, gratitude, Appreciation, optimism, belief, hope, contentment, passion... watever
Feeling Good makes oneself to aspire watever he or she wants to be.... :) it involves a lot of positive energy in it ... to make tat happen...
These are the toughest times the world is facing now.... the terrorism, the financial crisis... or anything which disrupts peace...presently the world is ever bounding with all forms of negative feeling.. either could be greed, guilt, revenge, jealous , hatred, frustration .. these forms of feelings in oneself is directly or indirectly responsible for the present situation of the world... so let all of us stop blaming others ... stop feeling sad or dejected of the current situation ... stop discussing abt the hard times ... stop all the negative things...
let us all be +ve enough to encourage about the good in this abundant world....
let us all feel good... feeling good creates a healthier society... and thus a better world...
so from now on ... feel good about everything that you are... and sure the world around you is going to change.. and u can even see the change in the world too .... :)

FEEL GOOD... TO HAVE A BETTER WORLD... !!!
NOTE: CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU WANT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU DONT WANT...
thats the secret of life....
Spend some time in finding wat you want in life....
we have been always spending time thinking abt wat we dont want in life...
i dont want less marks in my exams
i dont want to lose my job...
we dont want wars to happen...
we hate terrorism... by this way we all are encouraging the world with t the thoughts we have....
"ALL THAT WE ARE IS THE RESULT OF WHAT WE HAVE THOUGHT"
SO OUR THOUGHTS DEFINE OUR WORLD
Achieving Quality Living -  If we look around in history also in life around us, there are people who have created history or who are creating history. These are handful of people which you count on fingers while other part of population seems mere existing on the this planet rather than living the life. Just look closely any inspiring figure whether a social workers, reformers, spiritual leaders or Business Tycoons you can take any name say it Martin Luther king or Mother Teresa, or Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or Swami Vivekananda, Bill Gates, Henry Ford All these people have same number of minutes in a day as we have. Then why these people able to deliver much more than we do? What make them different from other people. Now this is a wider issue. I am catching one thread of discussion in this post.   If you realize in life we do kind of actions one which are life supporting and other are life degrading. Life supporting actions help us to move forward life life degrading actions bind our legs and put us back. And not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn't hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don't supposed to do. Wrong actions come with consequences which takes a huge amount of time and energy to clear it up and come to the ground zero again. Whether these are wrong habits, wrong patterns or wrong decisions.

Sri Sri rightly says, "people spend half of the health to gain the wealth and then spend half of the wealth to gain back health." Not a wise things to do. Same is the case with most of refreshment and entertainment means in society like alcohol, smoking or explicit sex, too much of movies or drugs; all of them come with huge toll on the nervous system. Momentary excitement of senses doesn't give a bliss, yet once mind is trapped in the habit to enjoy these excitements; not doing these things causes huge pain: that's the bondage where most of population has stuck and then there is huge fight to come back to our ground zero state. Similar is the case when we ruin our relationship with somebody and then it become a hassle to recover it. Everybody want good relations with all yet some where we screw it up and then it take so much of efforts to put it back on track and sometime even life time doesn't suffice to recover few issues. So watch carefully next time you choose your words or actions or decision and remember a fact not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn't hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don't supposed to do.

Slowly when we drop the things which we don't supposed to do, life become much more peaceful and expression of success all around.

All Glory to Gurudev

I am writing this sitting in the Accident & Emergency department of the hospital for the second time in a month, and probably the 6th time in two years. This time its Mate's turn. He of nimble feet was running in the living room (my five year old has gone all middle class on us and has banned the description front room), when he tripped over some fresh air and cracked his head on the open patio door. He only cried for a minute, there wasn't even that much blood to be honest. If it had been me I would have filled the cut with ground pepper and put some sellotape on it. Unfortunately this is a method the Wife disapproves of so it was off to the hospital.

Knowing she would freak out, I decided to ring the wife whilst driving there and get it over and done with. She hates speaking to me when I'm driving and using the hands free and always keeps the conversations short, so I obviously use this tactic a lot. Such was her maternal panic that not even this was working, so I had to resort to beeping and shouting "Get out the way" to imaginary road users. That did the trick.
life is a sinking boat.

that nothing one does is right. gunning into a fight, one is a bull headed fool. avoid a fight, one is a coward. once sides have been picked, enemies are marked. if third parties start jumping in and giving biased opinions, there is no more room for mercy. but was it better to sidestep an argument that could will only get everyone's blood boiling; or was it better to fight fire with fire?


i have never claimed that i am a good person. i've always warned anyone, everyone that i am a bad person - which is the truth, black as charcoal, dark as the shadow of the dark side of the moon; you are disappointed because of the illusion because you believe there is a redeemable quality in this shell called me, but for every good, the taint of saidin reeks corruption to my weaves.


call me childish, a fool, coward; but once you pick a side, then you are my enemy. it makes complete sense, the world is simple; it becomes black and white. i am a simple minded fool. spots of grey should be cast to dark corners like refuse never to see light, and to be given to natural death.

break
Thursday, 18 February 2010
how many times must my heart break,
before it becomes but specks of dust,
and many a times should it be stabbed,
till pain can no longer be felt,
the countless falls i must take, 
to shed hope, turn these memories,
forgone of love in times past castaway 
into rage, and ire, and hate, become 
a storm burning, unrelenting in fury,
like the heart of a midnight sun?

why

why, is it not enough to turn your back on me,

       ...that you feel obliged to desecrate our past too?

The Song of Dionysius
Wednesday, 10 February 2010




can thou hear? the soft whisper cracks,
invisible fault lines pulsing,
the gentle tremble of mine core,
willing to smash into atoms,
to painful memories of careless
spoken words and heartless thoughts.


How could one so completely,
dictate mine emotions as if
mine soul is nought but notations 
to melody of ecstasy to anguish 
in but few clef tied in harmony, 
to the tunes of mine epitaph,
and dressed for dust and ashes?
Why I am not ME..!! (n U r NOT urSELF)
......one of my friends asked me yesterday, if i have ever noticed that people try to make everyone around them like themselves...

......well,yeah. I have. I haven't noticed this.. but i have observed that it is in nature of everyone to make others like themselves.Everyone naturally behaves in a manner which attracts others to their way of thinking.

......but there is a little complication because people show different level of stubbornness in holding on to their own thoughts.Ultimately not everyone can turn everyone around them like themselves.There are surely going to be few losers and few winners in this battle of wits.Here we are going to talk about the ones who get influenced rather than influencing.

Some people are very easily influenced by others.It is very easy to convince them for anything.Such people either badly lack in self confidence or they do not think at all and derive any conclusion themselves.The latter is a very don't care sort of attitude which results from the over protectiveness received by the person in their former life.This makes them devoid of self dependence though they have enough confidence and capabilities.The former kind wants to establish his own way of thinking and conclusion,but he so easily gets captivated by others confidence that he never dares to challenge it.He readily agrees to things in very short time and ignores his original thoughts.. stepping down one more step from his intellectuality.

......comparing both these natures, we feel that they are really too contrasting, and yes, they are.
Where one has a highly centered and self destructive attitude who don't cares about anything at all in life, other one don't even understands the term attitude and value of self.He cares too much about everyone and everything happening around him...
Where one is always happy and cool even in situation of serious consideration, other is hardly happy in life and is always worried in every situation.

.....Now, here is a point.How come these two entirely opposite natures of human life suffer from same problem? okay.. so here i have the answer for you which is as universal as sun and moon... earth and water... clouds n air.. "Nature is dual faced and the extremes often get mixed up.. At the end of journey.. u ll find yourself standing at the same place u started.So this is what u get after changing yourself too much.Same again..."
I positively hope that u ll be able to gulp that little amount of philosophy.Anyway coming to our point a little more directly this time,we often find people or things with very opposite nature in same pit. Most probably,this is because both of them are wrong.We know well that both, a little too less or a little too much are dangerous.One should always try to avoid the extremes.

Well.. if you are still looking for a common reason,there is one,indeed.All the people who have this tendency of becoming like others and follow someone, severely lack in "self belief ". Self belief is again a very simple thing of complicated nature.But it is the most important element in anybodies character which defines the whole face of his life. 

P.S. "hope you are not confused between self confidence and self belief. They are different... allot.

bottom line : realise the importance of SELF BELIEF in life... dont get carried away by others thoughts and beliefs...
Dalai Lama and Sri Sri say the same thing… I was reading Art of Living famous Sri Sri's articles and then once I read this story of Dalai Lama. Both said exactly the same thing about forgiving...  How divine... spend a couple of minutes to think about it..  Excerpt from book : The wisdom of forgiveness (Page 47) 
When I first met the Dalai Lama some three decades ago, he told me that he had for given the Chinese for what they have done to the Tibetans.At the time, I had been surprised. Now I wanted to learn more in the upcoming interview. As the Dalai Lama came into the audience hall and sat down across from me, I asked him without any preamble, "Your Holiness, I thought it natural that you'd harbor resentment toward the Chinese. Yet you've told me that this is not so. But do you, sometimes at least, experience deep feelings of animosity?""That almost never," the Dalai Lama replied. "I analyze like this: if I develop bad feelings toward those who make me suffer, this will only destroy my own peace of mind. But if I forgive, my mind becomes calm. Now, concerning our struggle for freedom, if we do it without anger, without hatred,but with true forgiveness, we can carry that struggle even more effectively. Struggle with calm mind, with compassion.Through analytical meditation, I now have full conviction that destructive emotions like hatred is no use. Nowadays,anger, hatred, they don't come. But little irritation some-times come."
Another reason is that there are 2 seniors who have helped us a lot once we got down at Raleigh-Arun and Srinath. They treated us almost like brothers and more than just some fellow Indian. In this time of the world where at times even friends think twice about helping friends, we were really amazed at the way those 2 guys helped us out and are still helping us out. Both of them advise us so much, help us out. Arun is one amazing guy though. He takes not only us but any fresher out for shopping for groceries or clothes or laptops. He lives near my house and it is his open invitation that anyone can come into his house at any time. Most of the time, excepting after 11 pm, there are atleast 6 to 10 guys in his house, either playing the PS2 or accessing his net or just sit there for chatting with the others. More than that he is such a lively person that most of the time he is cracking jokes and making other people laugh. We realized that there is no method from our side to pay them back for all their kindness they have done for us.
I have been working in a corporate office for 2.5 years now and have made many real friends. But this is not I am about tell you now. I am going to tell about a set of pseudo buddies you make because you cannot control your body’s metabolism. Yes! Restroom buddies! You still may think it is some people you befriend in the restroom. No! these are pseudo! Over the past 2.5, I have seen a pattern, the same set of people seem to be present in the restroom when I enter the restroom, regardless of what time I enter, be it morning, noon, afternoon, 3 PM 4 PM whatever odd time, they are there! And even on the same day, they are there everytime you go! Then you realise, that these are the people whose bodies may probably function similar to yours, may be they have the same rate of metabolism, may be they have the same bodily cycles. It makes me get a friendly feeling towards them. After all, who does not like similar people!? Something like a stockholm syndorme. But the friendly feeling is not because you see them everyday, it is because deep down you know that you may be physically similar people.
I changed my watch. I wore a pair of shoes that had been ignored for long. I attended to my car repair personally. While driving to Jalsa I reprimanded a traffic offender. I sang along with the FM radio jock as one of my favorites belted itself out from the speakers on the car. I checked the electricals in the house that were giving us a problem. I unpacked and laid out the various gifts presented to me from the Oman Excellencies. I fixed my computer, discovering during the course that I had been using the wrong cable box for my internet connection. I made calls to people that I had been avoiding for sometime. And I watched the IPL with great delight. And I discovered that this was all due to the fact that I pushed myself to a work- out in the morning, despite the vagaries of the  previous night. I am content and painless - both in body and mind now. And I believe that this has come about by the simple fact of putting my body back into routine. When you miss the routine, the essentials of everyday, the spasms of life shall forever bother you and become a hindrance. I had subjected my body to much malaise and lethargy. Lethargy brings about defeat. It nurtures weakness in our confidence and the urge to move forward.
Three weeks after the mother on ABC’s Brothers and Sisters (“Nora Walker” played by Sally Field) fretted over the GOP “denying global warming,” the ABC drama on Sunday night featured an episode centered around her daughter, “Kitty Walker-McCallister,” a Republican candidate for Senate in California played by Calista Flockhart, coming under attack from conservative rubes who think she used her influence to get the visa renewed for her older sister’s French boyfriend, “Luc.”

At a campaign event with mini-video camera-toting bloggers visible, protesters boo and repeatedly chant: “America for Americans!” as they hold up signs, such as “FRENCHIE GO HOME!!!” and, with a mustache added to Kitty’s face, “Hi Kitler!” Just like the real media’s slander of Tea Party protesters.

Kitty’s husband whom she is running to succeed, incumbent “Senator Robert McCallister,” played by Rob Lowe, charges: “It’s just the conservative purity police trying to purge the party of lily-livered Republican moderates.” Kitty complains to her sister, “Sarah Walker,” played by Rachel Griffiths: “I am fighting for my political life with a bunch of ultra-conservative yahoos who want my head because you decided to fall in love with a guy who has immigration issues.”

Earlier this morning during a keynote at SXSW, Twitter CEO and co-founder Evan Williams announced the availability of Twitter’s @Anywhere platform. It is an identity system and is widely viewed as an answer to Facebook Connect. It allows Twitter subscribers to use their Twitter credentials to login to third-party services. The announcement was short on details and left me scratching my head.

Over Twitter, I asked Evan Williams if he would offer more details. He tweeted back and said that the “details will come (specifically at Chirp).” Chirp is Twitter’s official developer conference slotted for April 14-15 and will be held in San Francisco. It could be a big week for Twitter. AllThingsD speculates that the company might also announce its plans for an ad-platform at the AdAge conference scheduled for April 12-13 in New York. There is clearly a lot of interest in San Francisco-based social messaging company which is valued at around a billion dollars and is viewed as a potential competitor to Facebook.

On Twitter Blog co-founder Biz Stone wrote:

    We’ve developed a new set of frameworks for adding this Twitter experience anywhere on the web. …When we’re ready to launch, initial participating sites will include Amazon, AdAge, Bing, Citysearch, Digg, eBay, The Huffington Post, Meebo, MSNBC.com, The New York Times, Salesforce.com, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Imagine being able to follow a New York Times journalist directly from her byline, tweet about a video without leaving YouTube, and discover new Twitter accounts while visiting the Yahoo! home page—and that’s just the beginning. Twitter has proven to be compelling in a variety of ways. With @anywhere, web site owners and operators will be able to offer visitors more value with less heavy lifting.
NBC’s "Law & Order" programs are long-established and all over the schedule. But the sex-obsessed vice cops of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" are a breed apart. They exist to be socially provocative, which is to say, to rattle, to disturb. Viewers at home probably weren’t ready for the plot that aired on NBC on March 3. These script writers are so revolting that they become almost comical.

As you read what follows, you decided how closely this mirrors anything resembling the world of reality.

Someone was strangling prostitutes to death and leaving prayer cards behind. The first suspect was a perverted man whose wife proclaimed he had converted to Christianity and overcome his sinful ways. The cops quickly discovered the man dismissed his wife as a "prude" and he was cheating on her with a variety of young girls, because "it’s not a crime to want a little variety" in his sex life, including "toys, role play, and threesomes." Despite his ardor for sexual gunplay as well, this so-called Christian was not the strangler.

Ornette Coleman is sitting at a table in the middle of his spacious loft, a fourth-floor aerie above the garment district bustle on West 36th Street in Midtown Manhattan.

It is a happy moment for a reporter: You hear on the radio that Mr. Coleman, the alto saxophonist and composer, turns 80 today — Tuesday, March 9, 2010 — and you call him up, introduce yourself and get invited over immediately.

You find him sitting there almost exactly as envisioned, in the darkened, quiet space, outlined in a cone of lamplight and writing away — not on music paper with staves and clefs, but rather on regular lined paper in a spiral notebook.

Are they hieroglyphics? Japanese characters? The calligraphy of the avant-garde? It turns out to be his left-handed stylish printing of notes — B-flats, G-sharps and such — arranged into strings and matrices. Such notation fills the pages of several notebooks stacked nearby.

Physically, Mr. Coleman may be perched on a high stool, dressed in a colorful print shirt, black slacks with suspenders and wine-colored loafers, but his mind is an antigravity chamber, floating in the middle of this room decorated with contemporary furniture and huge Modern paintings.
Aol launched Lifestream, a social aggregator and publisher, as part of their AIM platform at TechCrunch50 Last Fall. Since then it has gained nearly 2 million users, say Aol. Based on that success Aol is now launching Lifestream as a standalone product at lifestream.aol.com.

Like Friendfeed, Lifestream aggregates a number of third party social networks – Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Foursquare, Delicious, Digg, Flickr, YouTube, etc., so if you follow a Lifestream user you’ll see all of the content that user publishes on those networks, and Lifestream automatically pulls in content from people you already follow on those various social networks, so you don’t have to create yet another new friend list. Lifestream isn’t yet integrated with Google Buzz, but Aol says it may be coming soon.

Users can filter out content from specific networks if they like, on a per user or broad basis. A way to think about this – “noise cancellation for social networks.”

Lifestream also lets users publish back to social networks. Status updates posted to Lifestream can be posted back to Facebook, Myspace and/or Twitter. Lifestream also optionally notes your location in your status updates via GPS on mobile devices, or you can manually add it instead.
As part of the Federal Trade Commission’s ongoing hearings into the future of journalism, Google’s chief economist, Hal Varian, gave a presentation on newspapers and their financial problems that is well worth taking some time to read (or view). The slide deck is embedded below, and Martin Langeveld has a great overview at the Nieman Journalism Lab that also includes a transcript of Varian’s presentation. The Google economist (who also wrote a blog post) does a pretty thorough job of explaining the untenable position that newspapers currently find themselves in, and how it isn’t the Internet’s fault (in other words, it isn’t Google’s fault).

The biggest problem, Varian says, is that the news part of what newspapers do — the hard reporting and crime and investigative stuff that everyone thinks of when they say the word “journalism” — has traditionally been subsidized by all the rest of what newspapers do, such as the automotive section, the travel section, the lifestyle features and so on (which almost no one thinks of when they say the word “journalism”). Those other parts of the paper, unfortunately, are being targeted by subject-specific web sites and services, leaving the news part of the operation unprotected. As he put it:

    Traditionally, the ad revenue from these special sections has been used to cross-subsidize the core news production. Nowadays internet users go directly to websites like Edmunds, Orbitz, Epicurious, and Amazon to look for products and services in specialized areas. Not surprisingly, advertisers follow those eyeballs, which makes the traditional cross-subsidization model that newspapers have used far more difficult.

Although it’s admittedly a bit presumptuous to expect Varian to come up with solutions to this problem, he’s a little light on the solutions front, mentioning Google’s “FastFlip” experiment as one possible answer, as well as Living Stories and a couple of other Google projects. But one part of his presentation really hit home with me, and that was when he talked about the amount of time people spend with the news online. On average, he said, they spend about 70 seconds a day. Varian says part of the reason for that is people reading online at work, where they have less time to spend with the news.
It's a topic that would probably make the average individual's eyes glaze over, but will have a profound impact on the economy - for better or worse. The topic - financial regulation reform.

With Senate Banking Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., setting his proposal out for the public, the take away on the reporting from two of the country's major newspapers - The New York Times and Wall Street Journal can give readers a view where their reporters' loyalties lie.

On CNBC's March 15 "Squawk Box," co-host Joe Kernen raised this point - the Journal with its more pro-Wall Street point of view and the Times with a liberal pro-Democratic Party one.

"You - I like the way you highlighted the Journal's take, ‘Ohh, this thing is ahh, much worse,' but The New York Times - ‘consensus-building,'" Kernen said. "But The New York Times is talking about consensus-building within the Democratic Party, I think, right? I mean, normally that's who they're speaking to, isn't it?"

Are you desperate for an iPad-like device, short on cash, and long on the desire to completely jack up your netbook? Well you're in luck, friend, as the proprietor of MSI Wind fansite Insanely Wind has crafted a device which may satiate your tablety desires. By taking a U100, removing the keyboard, relocating a touchscreen display to the bottom half of the unit, and doing some simple rewiring, user alexbates has fashioned a tablet which he says bests a device like the iPad or JooJoo with "10 times the storage, twice the speed, external video (VGA), webcam, USB ports, and built-in multi card reader." Of course, as you can tell by the photos, this mod has a ways to go before it's got the fit and finish of the aforementioned devices, and you'll have rev up a compatible, hackintosh build of OS X to make it appropriately Apple-ish -- but it can clearly be done. While this isn't the first time we've seen this type of modification, it's nice to see the love spreading to various  devices (and done in a fashion that doesn't seem overly complicated). From the sounds of things, this project hasn't hit its zenith yet, so we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for a more complete variation of the Windlet (our name). For now, hit the read link and keep up with the unfolding saga.
I am so surprised, that this early in March, we are already seeing very warm weather. In fact, we did not see the normal Canadian winter that I am used to, and the one that I was dreading. I guess it is nice to get a year off, every now and then.

There is still a lot of snow on the ground that needs to melt, but it is certainly well on its way. I go outside, and keep thinking that there is still so much snow to melt, but then I simply have to remember how much snow we had prior to the melt starting, and I know things are going down well.

I wonder though, if a milder winter this year, means a more intense winter next year? If That is the case, Zhifang will be in for a real eye opener, as Canada's winter can be something on the extreme side. Winter storms hit with a fury, and when all is said and done, the only thing you can do, is find your shovel and start digging out.
No, this isn’t an obituary to my blog, though considering the level of inactivity this year, I suppose you could declare it brain dead.

Did that metaphor make sense? No? Good. I’ve still got it.

But yes, I’ve been just a bit stressed for time these days, especially now that my training is done and I’m officially on permanent status. My restricted time on the internet is spent either reading blogs, sports news or chatting with people in time zones that really mess with my sleep cycle, none of which inspire a blog post.

And then I went to church.

It was one of the weekends that I was at home, and as usual I was busy trying to cram in all the things that I missed out during the week, i.e. dongle-free internet, movies, home cooked food, and driving (I really, really miss driving!). However, in an attempt to infuse my short weekend stay with more ‘family time’, my parents decided that I should come with them for a memorial service. You know what they say; nothing brings the family together like a corpse.

So I swing by, reluctantly, while pondering the appropriate ‘game face’ to put on while at a memorial service. Not too sad (it’s not the funeral) and not too relaxed (you’re supposed to miss the man). It was the 1 year death anniversary of a family acquaintance, an old planter that used to come to our church, and as I sat in the pews reading the order of the service, I realized that this was actually the first time I had attended a memorial service.

It was rather awkward for me personally, watching this little parade of children and grandchildren telling the assembly how much they miss this man. It seemed unnecessary to me; surely this would be better suited for a more private and personal gathering. However, the best was definitely saved for last, when the widow and the pastor got up to tell what a fantastic, god-fearing, church-loving man he was. How they could do so with a straight face, heaven only knows. They might as well have told me he was the antichrist's secretary.



After ensuring I had indeed heard this right, I started to wonder how people could be so forgiving of those that have passed before us. It’s almost as if insults are forgiven by the time the body hits the floor, debts are forgiven by the time of the homily and extra-marital affairs and murder are forgiven by the time the sand starts piling up on the casket.

So is it only in death that we activate our ‘human spirit’? Do we have to wait till our last breath has come and gone to see compassion, concern and selective amnesia in our fellow man? I’m reminded of Mark Twain’s “Tom Sawyer”, when he and his friends staged their own funeral to milk the sympathy that they knew would be overflowing for them, despite them being a public nuisance.

When I was very young, I didn’t see much of my father as he worked late, and so my five year old brain devised a way to ‘check’ how much I missed him. I would imagine him dying, or imagine hearing of his death, and then if I felt immensely sad about it, then I knew that I really did care and I really did miss him.

Silly, stupid, terrible – and yet, perhaps apt.

Bottom line: make sure you tell your friends all the things you hate about them right now! You never know when they may drop dead and put you in the unenviable position of having to lie through your teeth at church.
You wouldn't expect to find "We've tightened up the graphics on Episode Three" among the usual list of noted improvements between Telltale's episodic releases. After all, with endearing, demented characters like Sam and Max taking up quite a bit of the screen, who cares how many polygons are left for that pot plant in the corner?

"We wanted to bump everything up presentation-wise for this season," said designer Chuck Jordan, drawing attention to the Telltale engine's impressive -- nay, tight -- visual enhancements. The Penal Zone, the first of five monthly episodes comprising Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse, features noticeably improved lighting, real-time shadows and more expressive facial animation. As Jordan pointed out, "an expression can sell a joke for the first time."

Based on the demo I saw at the Game Developers Conference, it's also apparent that the improved graphics do make a difference to that pot plant. Because you transform into one. "When you finally get to control Max," Jordan said, "it's really weird." Like, really really weird.
Gallery: Sam & Max: Devil's Playhouse

One of Max's newly acquired psychic abilities (accessed from a bizarre first-person viewpoint) allows him to transform into any physical object -- provided he's seen it in the form of a picture or a painting somewhere in the environment (obviously). It's an interesting puzzle-solving device that introduces an ability-driven approach to complement the traditional reliance on inventory item ... and since it lets Max turn into stuff like pot plants and bazookas, it's also super funny.

More psychic abilities will be unlocked as the season continues -- can they really get stranger than pictorial transformation or telephonic teleportation? -- but the first few already show that Telltale is cognizant of the formulaic fallbacks in a few of its games. Inventory manipulation has also been inverted, prompting you to select an object in the environment first and then pick an item to use from a redesigned interface. Those changes seem to benefit the PlayStation 3 version of The Devil's Playhouse, which also abandons the point-and-click interface in favor of direct control over the demented duo on the left analogue stick.

Of course, it's also worth pointing out that Telltale's excellent, unhinged humor still plays a crucial role in Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse. I don't think fans will be disappointed by the delightful B-movie trappings, not when there's a talking brain, a megalomaniacal ape and a host of unanswered mysteries right from the start. Only an enigmatic narrator (Criswell's cousin?) hints at an explanation, but it's clear that the inevitably absurd answers will gradually be exposed as the season continues from its potent opener.
The current push for government-run health care via the nuclear option  and last week’s Blair House TV snooze-orama are clear demonstrations that Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid share Vladimir Lenin’s tenacity to impose radical change where it’s not welcome — in fact, where there’s downright hostility to change by a solid majority of Americans.  And make no mistake, Lenin was first and foremost about the will to power.

Gale winds of public disapproval may be blowing against proposed government-run health care and its proponents, but Obama and congressional Democratic leaders plod forward with stolid determination, now extending by six weeks the time to work through an acceptable framework to pass so-called health care reform. If that extension fails to secure health care reform legislation, then these leaders may seek another extension, if possible, in an effort to wear down opposition to their designs.

Before liberals level charges of red-baiting, I’ll offer that the differences between Lenin and the Bolsheviks and Obama and left-wing Democrats are significant, many, and varied. Through skullduggery, battle, and blood, Lenin established a dictatorship of the proletariat, which history has amply shown was a thinly veiled dictatorship by Lenin and his Communist Party heirs.  There was nothing “soft” about Lenin’s tyranny or Stalin’s. The mass graves of tens of millions of victims bear mute testament to these despots’ infamy.

Obama, Pelosi, and Reid are decidedly pale reds, or as was said in an earlier generation, “pinkos.” But all three have grand ambitions, make no mistake, to achieve through imposition the social — or should it be said, socialist — democracy that lies with deadening weight across the width and breadth of Western Europe. These three Democratic leaders are working within our system of government to fundamentally alter government’s relationship to the people. If these three succeed, the American experiment in liberty will effectively end.

The president and the two congressional leaders are so blinded by their ideology, so bullheaded in accomplishing a radical transformation of health care, that they’ve discarded the common sense and instinct for self-preservation that usually governs politicians’ actions. Instead, this triumvirate makes rationalizations for support of a proposal that’s been DOA almost from its inception.
I awoke to all the snow reports in the area reading between two and four inches. Then it was off to the webcams and CDOT cams. Vail Pass looked snowy and so did the top of Sun Up, I was head over the pass today for some more turns at Vail. 

Conditions were awesome, or crappy, depending on who you rode with on the chair. I will go with the former as will my new friend I made on High Noon. We lapped the chair a couple times together and both decided that although there was a definite crust under that few inches of fluff, it was pretty damn good skiing. 

The outside parts of the feet started to get to the point of ice bricks and the wind was biting my face. After four hours of powder hunting I decided it was time to head to the front side and get back to the truck. Stopped to buy the essentials for some chili, now off to tend to that.
Windows Phone 7 Series. Get used to the name, because it's now a part of the smartphone vernacular... however verbose it may seem. Today Microsoft launches one of its most ambitious (if not most ambitious) projects: the rebranding of Windows Mobile. The company is introducing the new mobile OS at Mobile World Congress 2010, in Barcelona, and if the press is anything to be believed, this is just the beginning. The phone operating system does away with pretty much every scrap of previous mobile efforts from Microsoft, from the look and feel down to the underlying code -- everything is brand new. 7 Series has rebuilt Windows Mobile from the ground up, featuring a completely altered home screen and user interface experience, robust Xbox LIVE and Zune integration, and vastly new and improved social networking tools. Gone is the familiar Start screen, now replaced with "tiles" which scroll vertically and can be customized as quick launches, links to contacts, or self contained widgets. The look of the OS has also been radically upended, mirroring the Zune HD experience closely, replete with that large, iconic text for menus, and content transitions which elegantly (and dimensionally) slide a user into and out of different views. The OS is also heavily focused on social networking, providing integrated contact pages which show status updates from multiple services and allow fast jumps to richer cloud content (such as photo galleries). The Xbox integration will include LIVE games, avatars, and profiles, while the Zune end of things appears to be a carbon copy of the standalone device's features (including FM radio).

Besides just flipping the script on the brand, the company seems to be taking a much more vertical approach with hardware and user experience, dictating rigid specs for 7 Series devices (a specific CPU and speed, screen aspect ratio and resolution, memory, and even button configuration), and doing away with carrier or partner UI customizations such as Sense or TouchWiz. That's right -- there will be a single Windows Phone identity regardless of carrier or device brand. Those new phones will likely look similar at first, featuring a high res touchscreen, three front-facing buttons (back, start, and perhaps not shockingly, a Bing key), and little else.

Carrier partnerships are far and wide, including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom AG, Orange, SFR, Sprint, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T-Mobile USA, Verizon Wireless and Vodafone, while hardware partners include Dell, Garmin-Asus, HTC, HP, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Toshiba and Qualcomm. We're told that we likely won't get to see any third-party devices at MWC, though Microsoft is showing off dev units of unknown origin, and the first handsets are supposed to hit the market by the holidays of this year.
In one room, Meade Esposito, the Democratic boss from Brooklyn, was tightening his grip on the Brooklyn waterfront.

Next door, New York’s former mayor, John V. Lindsay, was struggling with the teachers strike of 1968. And in the third room, an idealistic young woman from the Midwest was trying to teach poetry at Rikers Island.

It was just another day at a recording studio in Manhattan where New York stories are lifted off the printed page and into the spoken word for blind New Yorkers seeking audio versions of books about their city.

The little-known service is run by the New York Public Library out of the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library on West 20th Street.

“A lot of the books we record fall into that ‘New Yorkana’ category,” said Susan Mosakowski, a playwright and theater producer who runs the program, which puts out up to 50 titles a year, many of them New York-related books that have not had wide enough appeal to have been recorded by a publisher. “We have a lot of readers asking for books with a local interest, a local focus,” she said.

Dozens of New York-related books are displayed here: “NYPD: A City and Its Police,” by James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto;” “The Seltzer Man” by Ken Rush, about a veteran Brooklyn seltzer-schlepper; “Upper West Side Story,” by Peter Salwen.

A federal regulation enacted in the 1990s allows the library to record audio versions of books without having to secure publishing rights. Ms. Mosakowski has the luxury of being able to draw on New York City’s deep pool of vocal talent. Readers have included the Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn and Julie Pasqual, a storyteller, dancer and circus clown.
Last season, the Cleveland Browns were...for lack of a better term, a hot mess. It all stemmed from the quarterback position, where 2007 first round pick Brady Quinn and relative journeyman Derek Anderson took turns not really getting anything done.
Sure, the Browns won their last four games of the season, but they still finished 5-11, and that late run was largely due to running back Jamal Harrison, who tallied 558 of his 852 rushing yards in the team's final three games.
As soon as the season ended, they agreed to bring in Mike Holmgren, the former head coach of both the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks who currently has a number of former assistants working in head coaching jobs around the league.
Back in January, on Dan Patrick's radio show, Holmgren said that he would be sure to decide on a quarterback before training camp started and stick with him. Little did we know he wasn't actually referring to anyone that was on the roster at that time.
I personally was certain he was talking about Brady Quinn, since it's just not necessary to devote time to Derek Anderson, who is as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) as they come under center.
However, the events of the past week have been truly surprising, and have me re-evaluating Holmgren's plan. Anderson - considered a backup by most - was released, no shock there. However, Cleveland brought in ex-Seahawk (and Holmgren draftee) Seneca Wallace to replace Anderson.
They also have reportedly told teams that Quinn is available in trades, brought recent ex-Carolina Panther Jake Delhomme in for a visit today, and a
We went to an outdoor Symphony presentation of the BBC Blue Planet. The Fine Arts Museum has a hillside that provides near perfect seating for such an event. And it only rained enough to cause them to pass out free raincoats (flimsy but effective), not to get soaked.......

A friend Ken Elder passed away...one more farewell gathering missed while in Taiwan.

We drove, well Melissa did, we rode, to Taichung to support a fundraiser and visit some friends that teach at Morrison Academy who Melissa went to Russia with in 1994. Yep THAT long ago!

About 2/3 of the way there Melissa's car overheated. We stopped at a rest stop. Store, gas station and restrooms. (90 urinals)! Once we added 2 liters of water and the engine cooled some off we went. WELL about 20 minutes later we pulled over and (short version) rode in the car on the back of a flat bed tow truck into the next city to get a new thermostat and radiator. Sunday morning no less! AND back on the road in 2 hours!

We had dinner at Ponderosa, there are 2 in Taichung, with the Robarts then went back to their apartment for a short visit before driving home. It sure was nice to NOT have the extra servicing stops! This time the rest stop only had about 60 urinals..........

It was like driving to Regina and back for the day. WE'D NEVER DO THAT! Well ALMOST, never!! Dogs and Monday morning hair appointments pressed the return decision.

This afternoon I was out walking and noticed one clinic 'UROLOGY AND DERMATOLOGY' A curious combination in my limited experience! My mind wondered........I'll let you do yours and keep mine to myself, thank you very much.........

Well that's about it!
At our Mobilize 09 conference, Frank Meehan, CEO of London-based INQ, told me that his company was going to follow on the heels of its successful Facebook phone with more devices, including lower-cost smartphones targeting fast-growing mobile markets such as India. Today, the company launched its social mobile phones in India — and INQ has roped in MS Dhoni, captain of Indian cricket team, as its spokesperson. Aircel, a mobile carrier, will be selling the device to its customers. The INQ Mini 3G and the INQ Chat 3G will be available in India. The INQ Chat 3G is a QWERTY device. The highly competitive Indian mobile market has made it difficult for carriers to bank solely on voice revenues. The INQ devices are being made available at a time when Indian carriers are looking for ways to goose their data revenues.
Senator John Barrasso M.D. (R-WY), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, recently released a report [PDF]on the subcommittee’s work in the first year of the Obama Administration. The report has less to it than might be imagined — in the first year, the subcommittee has failed to meet or to hold a single hearing of its own. “There were exactly two hearings in 2009,” Barrasso said, “a joint hearing with the full committee on June 9th, and a joint hearing with the Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife on July 8th.”

The subcommittee was chartered by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, to perform oversight on the science involved with environmental issues. “Senator Boxer wanted the subcommittee to perform oversight on the Bush Administration, not the current administration,” Senator Barrasso said.  “We have made repeated requests to the chairman of the subcommittee [Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)] to hold hearings [in the past year] but no hearings have been held. It has been a lost year for science oversight in the Senate.”

“There have been plenty of reasons to hold hearings,” Barrasso said. “For example, in April 2009, Shawn McGibbon, a career attorney with Small Business Administration, wrote part of a memo saying the EPA had not considered the economic consequences of an Endangerment Finding for carbon dioxide.” When the memo became known, McGibbons was “smeared as a ‘Bush holdover’” even though she was hired during the Clinton Administration. Later, McGibbons was replaced by President Obama.

In another incident, Dr. Alan Carlin, a 39-year veteran of the EPA, prepared a report skeptical of the real human impact on the climate.  Carlin (who has since written several articles for Pajamas Media) was instructed not to disseminate the report and, as Kim Strassel reported in the Wall Street Journal, was denounced by “unnamed EPA officials” as a “climate change denier.” Dr. Carlin eventually left the EPA.
