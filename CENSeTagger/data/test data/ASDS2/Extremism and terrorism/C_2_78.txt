Wow, I think I can honestly say: if there's one kaafir on here that isn't hear just to try and mock and insult Islam, it's Silures (and no I'm not being sarcastic). There are so many reasons why they collaborate with the kaafir. It seems like that there are two types of collaborators, those with knowledge and those that are Jaahil. Those with knowledge that collaborate do so out of greed or out of hatred of Islam. The Jaahil may collaborate because of Taqleed, greed, or majboori (although still not justifiable)...
