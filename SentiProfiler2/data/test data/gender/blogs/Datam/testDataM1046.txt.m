The gaming world is a fucking flaming piece of shit. I'm honestly considering trading in my 360.

When I started playing PC FPS games in 1997 it was all about community, respect, friends and fun. I could hop on a server knowing that I was going to have fun, say "good game", "nice nade", "great shot" and in return have the same done back to me.

Now with the release of console games with access to the internet the fanbase of gaming has been spread throughout a wide community of thickheaded kids. Every time I get into a game of Modern Warfare 2 I am greeted in the lobby by hoards of latin-accented shit talkers screaming and not letting anyone get a word in edgewise. There's no longer any room for logic left in the game. Kids attracted to games like Halo 3 and Cod: World at War have completely overrun us. The immaturity level is astounding. I was 7 when I started playing online and I still had more maturity than these fucking assholes.

Honestly, if you're going to talk shit and act like you're better than me, then prove it. Stop being a pub scrub and get your ass into a private game and scrim or 1v1 me. The gaming world is obsolescent.
