It seems as the past few days everything has been crashing down on me. It's only 8 days away from my birthday and this is supposed to be happy and a joyful time. The girl I wanna be with doesn't know if she wants to be with me. My dad's best friend died 5 years ago on my birthday. I obviously don't like Christmas or my birthday anymore. School is beginning to get tougher, I'm sleeping less, and finding a job is still almost impossible. The economy only seems to be getting worse as time goes by, and our wonderful country seems to be deeper in debt. This is cool, right? In my opinion I think our government is the terrorists. They raise taxes to bail out the banks, they also give there self's raises over night. I think 9/11 was something the government did themselves. I'm not very up to date with political problems and what not, but like I said these are my opinions. Life just sucks....
