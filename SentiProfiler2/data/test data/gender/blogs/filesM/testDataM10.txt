for the past few days my brain has been turned off. i don't know why it is, but i go through spurts where i just turn off. maybe it's my brain's way of telling me it needs a break. my mind is very good at justifying breaks. no need to eat healthy ty, you just worked out. that's something my brain would say. it's a real bad influence on me as is my heart. they are always scheming of ways to make me look like a fool. i still like them though.
Everyone knows about the Subaru safety and reliability, but few are aware they're now taking the Euro sports cars head on. This car is the ultimate sleeper off the line, but is a great road trip vehicle, and has lots of utility. Drive it, and be ready to be impressed. Thanks Subaru!
Well started working on my game, figure out the pipe line and the game engine that I going to use. I am starting to make the assets for the first level. The plan is make the first level and see what I can do with it. It is kind of a steam punk western, that is all i am going to say for now. You can get the idea from this... it is a train.
In Mario 3 it's your job as Mario or his 'supporting role' brother Luigi to rescue 7 different and unique kingdoms that are being taking over by the 7 rotten Koppa kids of the original King Bowser from the first game. The story still doesn't explain why two Italian plumbers are in this fantasy world but I don't care.
Uh...creepy much?  Family Guy has always been one for the off-kilter comedy, but rarely has a series been so cavalier with its sacred canon than last night's "Go Stewie, Go."  Lois cheating on Peter, Brian coming onto Stewie in drag, Meg being Meg...Seth MacFarlane is all over the place. Last night saw the first Family Guy since February's "Extra-Large Medium," and the break hasn't done any favors for the show.  All the usual throw-away gags ensue, mostly falling flat, but occasionally garnering a chuckle or two
I've officially decided to wait on the Wii. With articles like this one popping up around the internet, I think it is worth my while to hold out until at least sometime next year. I got the DS right after it came out and then was upset when they put out the DS Lite not long afterward. Of course I switched to the sleeker and brighter Lite version, but I don't want to have to do that with the Wii.
Throughout the history of "Lost," long-dead characters have had a tendency to reappear, whether through ghostly visions, flashbacks and now, in its final season, flash-sideways'. In the first handful of new episodes, fans were reacquainted with characters such as Charlie Pace and Boone Carlyle, and we know that there are going to be other future appearances as well from the likes of Michael Dawson and the enigmatic Libby.Now, you can add another name to the list — Rebecca Mader is returning as Charlotte Lewis.
This car definitely lives up to the Honda name. It rides great, good on gas, and very room to be  a small vehicle. Its very roim, has an excellent sound system, and accelerates very fast for such a small motor. this is an all around great car. With a sort of small trunk
I had planned a whole big post for yesterday, but as you may have noticed, I missed my blogligation yesterday. Yup, that's right, I fucked up again. Oh well, I'm over worrying about it these days. If I remember, I remember, if I don't I don't.
I was told compound exercises are the best exercises for gaining mass so i do the bench press, but the problem is when i do the bench press i go on to do the tricep workouts but i dont have enough strength to carry it out. i got told that doing bench press alone is not good enough to properly develope your triceps and you have to do specific tricep workouts but i can't because i have been drained by doing the bench press. I know the simplest way to resolve this problem is by doing a split rountine but i've just got back into weightlifting so im doing full body workouts with a divide of the lower and upper sections, this is my routine monday upper, tuesday lower, wednesday rest, thursday upper, friday lower, weekend off, do you know anyway to resolve this problem? thanks.
30 Rock is a very...unique...show.  It's very easy to see why the Emmys flock to it like tweens to a Taylor Lautner poster; there's simply nothing else like it on TV.  A show like The Office usually goes out for more obvious discomfort-related gags, while 30 Rock engages a much more rapid-fire hit and miss of total absurdity.  It's been a few weeks since we've seen lachrymose Liz Lemon, even after the Olympics, and I can honestly say I missed the witty offbeat charm 30 Rock does so well.
I disagree with Ruse here, because I disagree with Dostoevsky. It's hard to prove a case in fiction, and I wasn't convinced by Crime and Punishment, where the protagonist Raskolnikov tries to prove his superiority to religious morality by robbing and killing an old woman. He botches the job, and eventually turns himself in -- just as the police are closing in on him anyway.
It was difficult because every company has cut their budget. I tried
many job search engines, but there is no internship available. Then, I
tried to use some old fashion way, mailing resume out, to companies
which I am interest. My respond is only 1 out of 20, and the only
respond was I made a following up call. It was not cost efficiency,
soon after few more attempts I drop this idea. After all, I decided
that it wasn't that bad to rely on connection to get a job. I went to
the student career center and asked the person to help. I read a
statement somewhere, and it said 90% of your first impression of
someone probably is right in the end. My guessing is correct, that
person was not capable of her job, because she can't even answer me
the result of a survey she asked those just grad student to do few
months ago.
purchased this camcorder as a gift for my cousin. I am always impressed with Canon's advanced technology and strong commitment to best quality. The picture quality outside in a bright, sunny day is amazingly sharp and the Image Stabilization feature works pretty well if you have a shaky hand like me while shooting. To shoot a scene indoors in a low light, the picture is kind of grainy, but still much better than a Panasonic camcorder at the same price range.
Three months ago, in June, Ji Lee and I went to Bishkek to initiate conversations and creations about public art. The art center where we called our home for the 2 weeks ended up with a new identity and a couple of public art projects. Now, I have returned to maintain the momentum at high. CEC generously provided funds for artist initiated public art project. Through a call for proposals, artists were invited to submit ideas for public artworks which will be installed on the grounds of B’Art.
Well going to try and get this all cough up. I still been building car, truck, motorcycles, and all most anything else you can think of, well it is a Living. Also some more scripting things, a incremental saver and a binding script.

But here is some of car that I have been working on. I have been working none stop sense the last time.
Quietly, Microsoft has lowered the price of its two Zune HD players by $20, according to official pricing on Microsoft's own site. The 32-Gbyte HD model now costs $269.99, while the 16-GB version now is priced at $199.99. If you visit those links, you'll also find comparison pricing that puts Amazon and other retailers even lower.
I experienced a couple of true Paddy's Day on the Emerald Isle. Basically, it went like this. The night before, one went out, got completely rat-arsed, sang a couple of pro-IRA songs at the end of the night, and found one's way home.

On St.Patrick's Day itself, one nursed their hangover, finally getting out of bed around tea-time, then one went out for some more craic, pretty much repeating the antics of the previous night.

The thing was it was just like any leisure-time in Ireland. Nobody gave a jot it was St.Patrick's Day. You don't need to give the Irish an excuse to drink themselves into oblivion.

The only people who give a monkey's about St.Patrick's Day are everybody but the Irish!
Annamalai Temple is an living symbol of ancient Tamil architecture. The 11 tiered East Rajagopuram towers to a height of 217 feet, while the fortified walls pierced with 4 tower entrances offer a formidable look to this vast temple complex . The Pei Gopuram, Tirumanjana Gopuram and Ammanaiammal gopuram are the other three. The 1000 pillared hall and the temple tank were built by Krishna Deva Rayarar of Vijayanagar.
i love these vitamins when they were from AARP and I would buy them from walgreen's
I used Sharp Auto body to repair my car after an accident, and I cannot say enough good things about this business.  Lou Sharp, the owner, was extremely courteous, friendly, and professional, and they did an excellent job on my car.  It looks brand new.  They even have a paint match guarantee, for the life of your car.  The entire staff was friendly, and a perk is the free loaner cars.  I highly recommend them.
About five years ago I was referred to Dr Richard Reschke for some lower back issues I was having.  He is a naprapathist, which I believe means that he studied the muscular system.  In any case, he is a miracle worker.  He seemed to know exactly how all the muscles interact with each other and how to massage and manipulate them to give me relief and help me develop preventative stretches and exercises.  I absolutely swear by Dr Reschke.
A number of years ago, I talked some of my friends into participating in an urban adventure race with me. The Denver Oyster is a fantastic event ~ lots of fun, great atmosphere, fantastic camaraderie ~ and I'm excited to be doing it again this year.
I have had the honor to smell the trash bins first hand. Let me ensure you it is a pleasant way to jumpstart one’s morning. Yes we should all have the great pleasure in taking out our garbage in the morning, like good little tenants trying to stave off small vermin and cockroaches, and get hit with a wall of putrid tang nastiness. Yes we should all have that pleasure. Further, I have previously matched the stench of the rubbish bin's odoriferous emanations to the ones festering behind your own kitchen door. Though I am not a creature with specially-honed olfactory cells, I ensure you that the special brand of stench you create is unmistakable.
After being in Miami for 90+ years Joe's Stone Crab opened its second location here in Chicago.  It has been a favorite for visitors and residents alike ever since. Although it is not the quintessential Chicago Steak House, for my tastes, it is much better.  Their specialty are the stone crabs.  They are fantastic and not readily available elsewhere.  I have had them at least 10 times.  However, recently I have become a big fan of their Alaskan King Crab legs.
This photo was taken in downtown tampa of my buddy tyler and it was my first wireless flash attempt, and so far people on flickr have seem to like with 9 awards lol. This shot is of my buddy tiny, and its also in downtown or near the st pete times forum. its a rail thats fun to hop and do stuff over. i overlaid it with two differant shots but i like it even though his head is cut in the first picture.
I think the thing that is really interesting about the old radio programs is that you had to use your imagination a lot. You couldn’t see what was happening you could only hear it. I can still visualize Fibber McGee opening his closet door and everything falling out every show, even though I never actually saw it. You had to imagine what they were doing and what was going on. That is something I missed when it came to television and you didn’t have to use your imagination, everything was right there for you. I guess the other ones I liked there were the mysteries like The Shadow, The Whistler, and The Green Hornet. I enjoyed those too.
From the moment I knew of Ben Stein, I knew he had worked for Nixon. I also knew he was relatively moderate when it came to economic policy (in as much as I can say, of course many would say that one can't be moderate if one disagrees with them). He felt that the wealthiest in America were paying a disproportionately lower percentage of their income (including capital gains) in taxes.
i am an introspective, quiet, thoughtful, often lost, sometimes found, conglomeration of people, events, and expectations filled and unfulfilled who meanders around a relatively small portion of this earth bringing what goodness i can to the time i am given. some recognize, accept, and cherish the somewhat insular sometimes bewildered by it all person that i actually am.
After I graduated in Bachelor of Business Administration, I went back Hong Kong and did three months part-time job as a logistic assistant. I did not satisfy with a position of assistant. I would like to make decision judgements and be hold accountability of my action. Here is what they say in America: undergrad only study about theory; a master program study about implementation. Then, I quickly used my connection connect with my old school; they granted me an assistantship soon I've contacted with them.
As a last thing, I was handed late last night the two books of award winners in comics and in prose from the Philippine Graphic/Fiction Awards that Fully Booked and I have been sponsoring for the last 5 years. They are really solid, good-looking books I'm proud to have been a part of helping to bring into existence. They'll be on sale tonight -- but only after the award winners are announced (because the winners are in there and we don't want to give it away).
Lately, I've been working on a collection of portraits that aim to capture the various personalities that have populated Major League Baseball throughout its history. I'm a diehard Mets fan (no apologies necessary) so the characters of the '86 Mets were an obvious jump-off point for me.
A while back, I wrote a post that described how trading dreams come true. Since that time, I've seen many traders fall short of their goals, and I've seen a good number find success. 
An unusual number of those that succeed do so in part because they find opportunities for mentorship. I'm not talking about the seminars, classes, and other events that offer "education" for traders. Rather, I'm describing a professional relationship in which a more senior trader models proper trading for a junior trader; offers timely feedback to the junior trader; and helps the junior trader structure his or her learning process.
Super Mario Bros (the original Nintendo version) was the first game I can remember playing to the point of ridiculousness, and is an instant classic.  Super Mario Bros. 3 was my absolute favorite game for that console.  Alas, I didnt' get a super nintendo, so here we are over 10 years later to teh New Super Mario Bros. game for the Nintendo Wii.  WHAT A GAME!  The 4-player co-op can get confusing and messy, but that's what the Wii system is all about: managing multiple players and making video games an interactive experience
I graduated Culinary Arts school in to years  and started to working at a steak house. I have also worked hotels I like hotels because I can work banquets, sautéing, broiler cooking and baking. I worked Executive Chef, Working Chef, Sous Chef, Banquet Chef and Line Cook. I have worked in a lot of Restaurants and the Arrowhead Country Club.

When the PS3 was first released, I got my hands on an 80G unit as soon as I could.  Needless to say I was blown away.  Not only were the games already available for the PS3 phenomenal, my old PS2 games also looked much better and played much faster.  Include the fact that the console also serves as an adequate Blu-Ray player, and I was in seventh heaven.

There's something about inhaling that fresh morning air. It's soothing and it heals. I feel like I'm taking in optimism and recharging the little batteries that keep me going through the drudge of the week. It's nice.
Whats going on fellas! 
We now have ourselves our very own Blog Site, for the Book Club. This will be our meeting place for our weekly discussions on the book we are currently reading. I have created accounts for each of the members of our club to be able to post to this site.
Its official, we have have a Forum to express our opinion's and ideas.
"Do you think she's lonely?" came the question regarding this old care-taker; and it was startling to think that such a person of joy could even think to be lonely at such a place near the beach.  Yet, there was something different about Marta; she sat in her chair outside the screen door while her cat Princess slowly shuffled her tail back and fourth.  I quickly learned that this woman would be someone who changed my perspective on dreams.  We sat with her, the morning after, while she recounted her story through the decades, through hardships, struggles, sickness and travel and I was startled to hear this Argentine woman declare that she has adopted Venezuela as her new home and her new heritage.
This event is called a 'race'. I have no illusions of winning anything besides maybe something in the drawing ... something that has nothing to do with skill or speed. But every event like this that I participate in ~ urban adventure races, triathlons, running races ~ I refer to as a race. It's not like I have the skill or youth or lifestyle to be able to have a chance of winning, so is it appropriate to call it a race? I think so, because it gives me a chance, every time I go out there, to challenge myself and to do better than I was able to do before. I'm racing less against the other competitors, and more against myself.

Of course this isn't a new concept ~ most personal trainers who work with ordinary people will say the same thing.

This adventure race, though, is going to force me to actually get back in shape. It's a team event, and I don't want to be the slow guy on the team (especially since I'll already be the old guy on the team). Plus, as I have discovered over a few years of doing triathlons, that the race is a lot more fun if the whole thing isn't a suffer-fest.
I am an almost-life-long Montanan; a baptized Catholic; an ardent Atheist; a practicing Buddhist; a lover of Wisdom. I find solitude to be as essential as air, though I am at times gregarious, and very often joyful, alone and with others. I laugh at my own jokes, love learning, and love those who truly love.... anything. I have certainty in little, and little time for those who are certain of much, though admire those whose certainty leads to service of humankind. I have a BA and almost an MA in (Western) Philosophy, an MA in Buddhist Studies, and am working on a Ph.D. in Buddhist Ethics at the U of London.
The majority of the work on my blog has been digital stuff. From here on out, no more photoshop posts. All traditional, I want to test myself if I can commit.
For a consumer who needs 8mm/Hi8/digial 8 functionality, the TRV460 is an obvious choice. But for the consumer who is looking to venture into the MiniDV format (overall smaller camcorder/tape size), the GR-D33 might be a good stepping stone camcorder. The GR-D33 promises to have good video and low light performance, so the slight upgrade investment may be worth it. Making the transition has its pros and cons, the pros being, if you own an older Digital8 camcorder with a DV in/out port, you have the option of digitally copying your older tapes to the newer format.
We are currently in Year C of the Lectionary but parishes preparing for baptisms at the Easter Vigil have the option of using the readings for Year A for several weeks, including March 21. This is because the Year A readings are especially suited to the Rites of Christian Initiation. So, parishes using Year C readings will find the texts and commentary here while parishes using Year A readings will find their texts and commentary here. Bringing children to Mass with you this weekend? Hints for helping youngsters prepare to hear the Word can be found here (sorry - Year C lections, only).
I have just always been a Chevy or Gm kind of guy. The worst thing I ever did was trade in the 72 Cutless Supreme, SWEET!
I honestly wish I could stop listening to Shakira's new song She Wolf.  No, I'm not proud.  Yes, I will keep listening anyway.

In other news, I discovered that I've managed to go over my 1500 out-of-network texts this month... by $50 worth... and the month isn't over yet.  Hmmm.

Breakfast in the AM with my Calc teacher from high school :) :) :) followed by cleaning out my closet for my mom :( :( :( then Salisbury with Matt and Caroline :) and bonfire at Katie's!! :)
Failed Communities, Failed Schools.                                                                                        I suppose we should be pleased that Pres. Obama found some sort of mojo somewhere (maybe Hillary told him where to look). Of course, as we might have expected from him and his ofay administration, he selected one of the weakest groups to target—teachers and schools. I’d really love to hear him threaten Congress and their handmaiden lobbyists with such gusto.

He got all pumped for his appearance at the US Chamber of Commerce, a group that thrives on bluster. He cited the wisdom of the Central Falls Board of Education (RI) for their firing of the entire high school faculty and staff. He framed his praise thus: “Our kids get only one chance at an education, and we need to get it right.” I guess the assumption is that everyone knows what “right” is. He had Colin “You break it, you own it” Powell by his side. And then there was Obama’s more characteristic mealy-mouthed assertion, “If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn’t show some signs of improvement, then there’s got to be a sense of accountability.” Well, yes, I’d say firing a whole faculty shows a sense, but not of accountability. No, the sense of accountability goes way beyond the faculty and even beyond the administration.
So it's a fantastic day outside. A balmy 42 degrees (47 tomorrow!), the sun is shining down its rejuvenating brilliance and I couldn't be more pleased about it. It's nice to just stand in the sunlight, close your eyes and tilt your head back a little. It feels like I imagine a hug from god would feel.
Still, I can't stay outside all day; the dishes won't do themselves after all. There are chores to be done and fantasy hockey teams to prep once again now that the Olympics are done. 
I can't help but to look at the news before going to my fantasy teams because I still feel it important to know what is going down on my planet even though the tao teaches mindlessness over mindfulness. Or as the ape savior Jesus teaches: do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Good stuff. 
But I do worry. Not so much about me but about all the rest of you humans out there. Can't help it. Every human alive should have the same right to be left alone that I used to have back when America was still a free country. But around the world disasters strike, American troops are shooting the hell out of some Afghanis and China is playing a game of chess with the entire planet. Checkmate will come when our nation yields world supremacy to them. Well, unless we Americans nuke the crap out of the planet. Then it's Kobayashi Maru.
I get mad about this because it didn't have to be this way, but greedy men with dreams of riches and lust for power brought have brought this nation to it. Both sides are to blame but since 1968 American policy has almost been entirely driven by the Republican party.
Nowadays those failed policies still haunt and reverberate through the highest levels. The current President still follows them. Bill Clinton followed them for the most part. Jimmy Carter never had an option but to follow them.
They’re re-building Banbury Cross or at least one of them, there are supposed to have been six original crosses dotted about the town. These were vabdalised by Cromwell's troops during the English civil war as part of their purging of Catholic monuments throughout England and later Wales, Cornwall, Scotland and of course Ireland. There is already a Victorian cross that stands in the middle of a busy roundabout which no one can get near to but this new one, by all appearances will be a monstrosity made from modern materials. At a time when money is short for frivalries I can understand why the council has opted not to have the cross built using more traditional techniques, but I am deeply resentful that this money has not gone to providing affordable council housing instead of the local housing lotery that they farcicly use in place of providing taxpayers with their deserved security.
So thank God I'm still in training cause I was scheduled for a shift from 12PM-11PM today and I would've missed three of my four classes. O_O I left Psychology at 6:40PM and drove to work. I had the same trainer tonight as I did the first day (Katherine), but today we followed a different doctor.

As soon as walk through those double doors, we go to an exam room where a middle-aged man is complaining about an abscess on his butt. Needless to say, he removes his pants and there it was. Not only is there an abscess, but there a massive amount of scar tissue from previous incidents. I guess they didn't go as well. Yikes. It was like the cheeks were abused with a meat tenderizer or something. It was graphic and yet that's not the worst part. The doctor unpacked a bandage from the abscess and pulled out a gauze plug the length of, let's say...a foot long. I was like, "Oh, wow. That's impressive." The doctor replies, "Oh, this is shorter than most packs." Just imagine the long bloody, pus-lined gauze strip coming out of an abscess on the butt-cheek. Yep, that's a keeper. Then, he proceeds to drain the pus out of it. Mmm...just dandy. :-D

Let's move on to a lighter note, shall we? There was a 5-yr. old that came in because he has a "big boo-boo on da fingor" as he had put it. Lol. I love kids. It was actually an infected area where he had gotten a finger prick a couple days before. A red blister had swollen up and collected some pus at the head. Your body loooves to produce pus when an infection occurs. It's just its way of saying, "Here's a lovely reminder that this needs to get checked out." :-D Anyway, the doctor orders a drainage to be done and we retrieve some supplies to do that. We also get another assistant to come in and help restrain the child as we do the procedure. You know kids, screaming and kicking and such. Funny thing is, the whole thing is going absolutely fine when the kid's finger is being washed and numbed. It's only when he sees the doctor pull out the needle to prick the head of the abscess in which the kid proceeds to scream at the top of his fucking lungs. Literally, the puncture takes a fraction of a second and the doctor tells him he's done. Tears were streaming down his face and he immediately shuts up. We give him some Neosporin on the finger and a band-aid and a freakin' cherry popsicle. Yes, a cherry popsicle.

So that was my second night on the job, albeit I was really only there for half the shift. Lol. Only two days have gone by and I've seen the craziest things and they're only to get crazier. Stay tuned, readers of interest. :-D
In my job, I get to take most of the winter off.  In Austin, that means perhaps two months when nothing is growing or falling.  Now it's spring and I am having a hard time getting back into it.  I don't want to work anymore.  I want to do what I love instead.
What is work anyway?  To me it's doing something for money you wouldn't otherwise be doing.  I don't believe in that either, Alex.  I think everyone should be paid to do what they most love doing.  You can't buy enthusiasm.

So I am looking to make a change.  I talked to a good friend who said the first thing I should do is print up business cards with just my name and contact information, but without saying what it is I do.

Like, "Robert Adams.  I don't believe in work."
Well maybe not, even if it worked for Alex.
I want to thank you god for everything I have, I know I'm not a rich man, but I'm not poor either. There’s others who are worse of than I.I know when my time comes to leave this world, I hope I can lay not in a hospital bed but in my own, I won't lay in sadness or fear, nor hate as I made peace with those who speak out against me. When I grow old and time stands at a halt for those few seconds. I will take my last breaths and sing my death song and prepare for a better world. As my spirit leaves my fragile body I know you will guide me to a place where I will lay in peace.

But I know I have a purpose on earth and a given time to do good things for those who need me. I'm not sad nor depress. I surrender myself to you lord and ready to fight the good fight and help those who walk into my life. I know I'm your lonely man lord no matter where I go I'm alone on this earth. But Lord you made me your patient man and I will stand the test of time to do what's right and to be good to others who need me. All I ask is a little time to have in this world and to be the man that I was meant to be. That’s all I want in life, that’s all I ask for.
I'm getting older every day and I am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible. I am Husband to 1, Daddyo to 5, Grand(Poppy) to another 5 (so far). I use Nikon Cameras and Lenses ... but I really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with ANY kind of camera. Photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life. It has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation. I am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself. I think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos I capture and in effect "see through my eyes" but for a moment. Thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement. I hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills. All of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way. God bless you all. NikonSniper Steve
Kristen called me with a aditude and said she was coming over and ppicking up her things. She came over and was very aggressive with me over petty things and she took her cloths. After she had things packed up she reminded me how empty my house will look like when she takes all the furniture away too. I just looked at her and said its ok they are just objects Kristen we need to focus on Aleya more then anything. She then told me that her mom was heading out of town all next week and if I wanted time with Aleya I could watch her all that week. I was very happy about that.
It's kind of funny how everything in life can alter itself so instantaneously. I've felt so beat-down and broken for the past few days that it's not even funny; and seriously, I don't even care anymore. Everything that has happened to me recently and everything that will continue to happen to me as a repercussion of those recent events, I will endure and overcome. I believe that it's all happened for a reason. I'm stronger and smarter than half of the stupid fucks that surround me and I'm done dealing with their shit. I think the outcome of all of this will prove to be advantageous as long as I look at everything in the right state of mind, stray from the negative, and do things to better myself rather than give two shits for other people. I just can't believe that it's taken me since July to realize it.

I no longer need to engross my mind with senseless bullshit brought on by other people. I don't want or need a friend that's going to be over-dramatic and have a blood and thunder attitude all the time. Especially if all she/he does is try to make me feel jealousy, tries to make me feel like I'm worthless, and tries to make me experience guilt for things that aren't of my own doing –or even issues with any sort of validity for that matter! I don't need to feel detestable because people don't feel the same way about me anymore, whether it be a girlfriend, friend or an acquaintance. Are you done with me? Have you had enough yet? Perfect then! I'm fucking finished with you and I realize now that I have been for a while! It's time for me to move on. I feel like I need change again. I can't handle this cut of situations by the same means and methodology that I used to deal with them –depression, hostility, frustration, violence, rage… It gets really old really fucking fast. I'm done with the conflict. I'm done with the brawling. I'm done with holding myself down with everybody else's problems. Count me the fuck out. It's time I live my life for myself and for nobody else.
I'm getting carried away. That last drawing session last two songs. I'm frustrated with this wireless internet connection, and this coffee is terrible. I desperately need to get this presentation organized.
One article down. Check out this drawing.

Nearly 9 o'clock. I'm getting cold.

Tomorrow Already
These are the last two pictures I wanted to include in yesterday's post.
It's 3am now, and I'm 40 pages away from the finish line in my text book. So much for trimming :./
I guess I'm pretty well finished with the text book. I'm going to set up a score in Sibelius now. I should reviewn the post hoc tests and then jot down all of the formulas I'll be using on the exam: repated measures t-test, independent measures ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA. The last two sections covered interactions between factors in factorial ANOVAS. I have a general idea of what the Tukey's HSD post hoc test is about, there was another post hoc test called Schaffe that was in the text but I'm not sure we covered it in class, and the LSD, which we covered in class but isn't in the book. I don't remember anything about that one.

What it all boils down to is ratios. Comparing datum grouped by factors, looking for systematic difference, reducing error caused by random variance. That's pretty well the short and long of it. Stats is kinda neat. It's 4am now.
TODAY is a good day now. Woke up to a dream screaming two days ago someone close to me said I was yelling like I was being ambushed and attacked. I can’t remember the dream at the time like everyone else that talks in their sleep once in awhile. But hours passed as I awoke from that hell and now days passed and now I feel that that was my own soul breaking back out, breaking outa the darkness and understanding what life is really about...If we live in the past all we do in the end is waist time and never move forward. If we focus on waiting for the other to feel that pain you yourself felt, you never feel life again. If you focus on your wants and needs too much, in the end you never get anything but broken dreams and wasted time. If you get blinded by what you lost you will never regain who you really are. We are all human, we need love and when love fails we NEED to Find it or else be by our selves having no one to be there when we feel lonely if ever again.

As I break outa my darkness, I know NOW that other person is breaking back down into theirs, as they fall deeper and deeper into what they did to get a small tad of right(the wrong way) they will discover soon that they just outweighed it with wrong. I know now I don’t have to cause that persion pain to get myself a good feeling, in the end I would be no better then them. In the end let them do it to themselves and hope that they don’t do anything stupid like they told you yourself to do on their last days in your heart. I now feel sadness for that persion, they will never have the life I will, they will always have to work hard to maintain what they did was right, we all know that a LIER cant maintain a truth if there is no truth in what they did....

My life is getting better, my life is working out. I have my real family and I have people that care as well. Living with someone for 8 years and never feeling the feeling I now feel without them has opened my eyes and opened my heart to just let it all fade

If any one reads this, I hope you learn from it

thank you for your time

Hello and sorry for the lateness it has been a busy weekend for me. Dealing with school, life, and my personal worries.(not having a boyfriend, the people around me hating me, and the general OMG IM GONNA DIE!!!!)

This last week has been very annoying, as I was in a stupor of slight depression all week due to a couple of incidents that really made me mad/upset. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say it involved homophobic remarks and a huge idiot who thinks himself very important. After discussing it with my mom(I know pathetic but it helped me feel better), I started thinking about why attitudes like that still persist in our schools. at first my anger wouldn’t let me think anything accept "stupid bloody fucking town!". However, after a while it came to me, education, or lack thereof.

All through history, prejudices have persisted through lack of information about the prejudiced group, thing, or person. It is the same with the ideas and prejudices about homosexuals, in my opinion it is all thanks to religion and I don’t just mean Christians, Catholics, and any other church based on those churches. I mean other religions like the ones that are practised in the Middle East. most factions of these religions are the ones responsible for the bad attitudes. How does this relate to my whole epiphany i talked about? well in my opinion these religions didn't base their opinions and attitudes on fact but on ideas that came from their bible or god. They didn't take time to realize that were not horrible sinning freaks, they got this idea of us in their heads and refused to see that they may have been wrong.
Your probably going to read this someday, if not sooner or later, probably sooner then I realize. I did what I had to do the way I thought it be proper anyhow. I’m sorry if you don’t approve of the decision I made. Here’s why I chose to say no more to our friendship. 


 You need to consider yourself a very lucky woman. You have a house, a nice car, and a good job so you would think things would be okay here. I’m not saying everything (or everyone) is perfect. But here’s my conflict with you and our friendship. Your husband feels as if though he is between a rock and a hard case with the marriage you two are binded in. He has taken it upon himself to contact most of the people you talk to to find out about Ricardo. Now something is very wrong with your marriage if he feels threatened enough to contact EVERYONE (this includes me) to tell Ricardo to stop talking to you. Something had to have been going on somewhere to make him feel this way. I know this from experience. I’m not saying you are cheating on him. Maybe you are, and if you are you need to either divorce him. Or you need to make the marriage you have right now work. Do you have any idea how lucky you are? Do you have any idea How much your husband loves you? I’m starting to understand why he is so far from you. I don’t think it’s all him anymore. Maybe it was in the beginning. But not anymore. 


 All I know is I’m not going to be an instigator into making him (or anyone else for that matter) feel bad. I know what my heart tells me about the situation. If you have guy friends, they need to remain your friends and nothing more! I have taken it upon myself to end the friendship so that way you and your husband can make things work out. I’m one less person he will have to worry about and that’s okay. He is supposed to come first in your life. You two are not boyfriend and girlfriend. This isn’t the situation in which you two need to put your friends first. You two swore at the alter to be there for each other through everything and anything. I think news the time to do just that. You can call me self-righteous and immoral. But if you do so you are only speaking of yourself as well. 

 This is what all your friends (whom re doing wrong with you) need to do if they care about the life you lead....
Ive been clean from the filth of world and fallen in the grace of God and so far shit has worked out better then I ever thought they will, now it's time to fix me! today I thought bout my environment and some people are like "lmao Noel you stupid..... Not dumb stupid but funny stupid" and then there's others that are like "you fucking idiot stop fucking up" lmao and I began to think and I was like hey why is person number too saying that ...... I FIGURED OUT WHY!! Lol because ......... "hey fuck face ...... Maybe if I enjoyed being as miserable as you are with what's happening then maybe I would actually want to try harder".

Now world I don't want you to think it's directed at a particular person or place but this is something that happens everyday no matter where Iam so it has nothing to do with anyone it's just a general comment to show that Iam much different then the rest in the sense that my life is directed towards one goal, it's a goal I have to meet and anything that comes in between is just temporary, again what that means is that my road to changing the world with film has just began and there's a high possibility that I may step on a few toes along the way. People that know me know that I don't care much towards athority which means I need to be my own boss OR get paid wayyyyyy more. Lol anyways look make your dreams come true and know we are all human and make mistakes, fuck where you are now, you need to get to where you want to be.
If that means taking a big pay decrease to make it happen then fuck it, if you ment to make it in what you want then you will. God has a fantastic plan for all of us, I know he's opened my eyes to make me see how possible it is now can you do the same?
I know there are some who think Jamie Oliver is a bit over the edge when it comes to his crusade re: obesity. 

I also know that there are those who have both good and not so good things to say about the TED Awards, speeches, etc. 

Indeed if you are one of the thousands (millions?) of Tech Crunch followers you probably saw the back and forth over the speech given by shock stand-up comedienne Sarah Silverman.

Be all that as it may, I came upon Jamie Oliver's speech because someone posted it on Twitter and thought it was something people should check out, so I did. I would give her credit here as well, but I have since lost the message.

Anyway, the reason I make reference to it here is twofold:

1. I have a lot of respect for what Oliver is trying to do and the commitment he demonstrates in trying to fight for change that he feels is critical on all sorts of levels.

With his background, and success, he could be spending his time and energy on lots of other stuff. He has chosen not to.

2. I also think that if you take the 18 or so minutes to hear what he has to say that as a result you will come away with some of the same feelings I have expressed above, and as a business leader, admire the passion he brings to those he hopes to influence to act.

After all, that's one of the key things leaders hope to do. Inspire people to follow. Oliver has his way of trying to achieve that, and each of us has ours. 

Just watching him in action helped to renew my energy; something we all need from time to time. 

No matter what needs renewing in your life, maybe Jamie's passion will help do that for you as well.
After a great weekend spent with old high school friends and our return to church Sunday it definitely made today very depressing. No matter how old I get I always keep wishing the weekends will never end. Maybe it was the perfect family day we all shared yesterday planting our spring flowers ending that got me in this funk. Or maybe being unemployed now for 2 and half months is really starting to take its toll on me. However I still applied for a position with USPS this morning but who knows where that will go. I was also thinking about going back to school but still undecided. So basically my day consisted of spacing out and not really spending anytime with Alora. That will be different tomorrow I promise. I was so out of it I didn't even workout today, that really screws up my weekly schedule trust me.
Holly arrived home around 3pm and was obviously in a funk like me because we butted heads almost immediately. She ended up going to the store to cool off while I took my cellphone apart. Stupid fight really so making up when she returned was easy. I ended up firing up the BBQ and cooked us a really good dinner. The family's sleeping already as I write this and I'm finishing up the Lakers game. So I guess today didn't turn out to bad now that I think of it. Should get up early tomorrow and head over to the Vitamin Shoppe for some needed supplements. Maybe I will make it up to Alora and take the dog and her to the park. Lakers win!
OK.. I have had enough of typing the answer to the gay or straight question. 

When I'm asked this every day, maybe 10 times per day.

The answer is......................  I am LOVE!!!  

I love all beings. I do not mean Bi sexual either. My sexual preference is Women.

BI Loving: The evolved being, capable of loving, caring and hugging for all humans.

In this day and age, if you are still Homophobic, you are way behind in evolution.

The Gay culture runs the world. They run fashion, entertainment and many of the top businesses, which make the world turn.  Ask somebody...

I go out The Gay clubs every now and then because the energy of the music and the people is very Happy, very pleasant. I love Gay people.   

Some of my closest and best friends are Gay and lesbian and I value them dearly (Sara Halford and Rico Hernandez). They are My Family practically.

So when I'm asked, If I'm straight or gay, I will refer all to this blog, to fully explain why I don't wish to be in the ignorant, straight, category. But then I'm not Gay either.

Like I said..... I AM LOVE

I choose to love all human beings under God and hang out and work in Happy loving environments. Partying at the gay club is fun. The music is great. The girls come in and feel free to dance without being harassed.

And a friendly note, to all those who are Homophobic..... I bet all the clothes you have in your Closet, were designed and made by a Gay man... think about it. Don’t bite the hand that clothes you....
Anyway no, I'm not considering a career in acting or any of the above. I was pondering princess for a while, but I worry that the idea might cast aspersions on my sexuality if nothing else, along with all the responsibility etc. Too much hassle.

No, I've found myself actually enjoying a piece of coursework me and a coursemate of mine have been working on for the last term. It's a Flash application; a website designed for promoting a game, which is in our case, fictional. I've gotten really into it, so much so that all my other projects have been on the backburner while I focus on this one. A dangerous thing to happen, but I really can't help it. I've spent the last 2-3 weeks designing menus, buttons, banners, flashy images, messing around with animation, really keen to get our site looking great and exciting to toy with. Everything makes a fun little sound when clicked, explosions fly on-screen to background music, I love it. And it's becoming more second-nature how do do things with Flash too the further we progress.
Cell phones have allowed us a tremendous amount of freedom. We can talk to our friends wherever we may be, make dinner plans, chat with our relatives, and yell at our cable provider from any place in the world. They have freed us from the bondage of land lines and the tyranny of the corded telephone. But there is something cell phones have not been able to free us from.

And that is the wrong number phone call.

I got my first cell phone in college. I was actually studying in Italy and it was more for emergency purposes than anything else. Nobody except a couple of friends back home and my parents knew I had one. I didn’t really get many wrong numbers. And if I did, they were in Italian and I couldn’t understand them anyway.

When I got back to the states I got my first brand spanking new cell American cell phone with what I thought was a pretty random Arizona cell phone number. Little did I know that number was 1 digit off from the Sunburst Resort.


People would call me and the conversation would go like this.

Hello?
Hi I’d like to make a reservation.
What?
I’d like to make a reservation for the 26 through the 30th of next month.
Um…. What?
Is this the Sunburst resort?
Oh. No.
I cannot believe that this weather is so stable at this time of the year.  It never even reached freezing last night.  The furnace is still going strong on the same load and this is day 3 since I loaded it.  It looks like the driveway is thawed out and dry already and this is only the middle of March.  If this keeps up the deer will be out of the yards and will start heading North where they will be sitting ducks for the first blizzard of the year.  You can bet that we still have another month of Winter coming and it is way too early to start spring chores.  This is not good news, it just portends a long and bad fire season.  

The boss is off to Minnesota for a couple of days to take her niece to school and will probably do a little shopping in the Mall of America with her Sister-in-Law Becky.  I will be on my own with just the dogs for company.  This is an opportunity for me to get started on some outside chores if I can get the body in gear after sitting on my rear end for the last couple of months.  I can almost walk on bare ground all of the way out to the apple trees and now is the time to do some pruning before they start growing again.  I should get a fresh can of pruning paint as I don't remember if I used all of what I had or not.  I think I will also put in some fertilizer stakes to encourage new growth instead of more apples.

I really want to change out the blower for the front loader just to force Mother Nature to dump more snow on us but then I would have to pay someone else to put the blower back on as that requires too much lifting for me to handle.  Without the loader I can't really do much cleanup from the winter as there is going to be a lot of lifting involved and I need to empty the trailer of the sugar beets before they start to ferment.  There are enough of them left over this year that the deer are going to have a real hangover if they try to pig out on them.  I just have to make sure that I get them far enough away from the house that the Brown dog will leave them alone.  I don't know what she would be like if she got into a bunch of fermented beets and I don't want to know either.  Just the thought of her drunk on beets is enough to give me a headache.

I guess that I had better make myself a list of what I want to accomplish this summer, although I know that is just a dream, I can at least pretend to be productive.  First I have to allow time to watch the sun come up while enjoy a hot cup of coffee on the swing.  Later
I was excited to discover this upcoming book today!  Here's the description from the publisher, and you can find a few more details there at:    

University of North Texas Press

The subantarctic forests of South America are the world’s southernmost forested ecosystems. The birds have sung in these austral forests for millions of years; the Yahgan and Mapuche peoples have handed down their bird stories from generation to generation for hundreds of years.

In Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America, Ricardo Rozzi and his collaborators present a unique combination of bird guide and cultural ethnography. The book includes entries on fifty bird species of southern Chile and Argentina, among them the Magellanic Woodpecker, Rufous-Legged Owl, Ringed Kingfisher, Buff-Necked Ibis, Giant Hummingbird, and Andean Condor. Each bird is named in Yahgan, Mapudungun, Spanish, English, and scientific nomenclature, followed by a description, full color photographs, the bird’s distribution map, habitat and lifestyle, and its history in the region.

Each entry is augmented further with indigenous accounts of the bird in history and folklore. Two audio CDs (included) orient the reader with the birdcalls and their names in four languages, followed by numerous narratives of Yahgan and Mapuche stories about the birds translated directly from interviews with elders of both
Hello. I wanted to poke my head in and say thanks.  I've been thrilled, touched and energized by the comments and all the cool people following the blog.  I'm a writer who was using podcasting ( RoneyZone Radio ( http://rzr.roneyzone.com )) to get my message out, but I missed out on so much by not blogging here. I'm so happy to be here amongst all you great people.

I am here to stay, and I promise that this blog will be funny, touching and a teeny bit geeky, but all good. I have big plans for this blog, so I would ask that you would tell your friends about it, and stick with it as it grows.

More fun and great stuff to come. I will be spotlighting great people (including my wife, ya'll), and maybe even a little geeky stuff. I want this blog to be something special, so here we go. :)
During the span of the last two days, I met with over 200 companies, and most of them said they had a really great show. After attending the furniture show two weeks ago, and this fashion show this week, I can't help but get the sense that business conditions are slowly but steadily improving. There were a lot of smiling company owners at both shows. Things are look'n up!

Unfortunately, covering so much ground, and talking with so many companies, my camera didn't come out of my pocket nearly enough. However, this next photo just had to be taken...
Everyone who actually goes to the shows for the music anymore is close to being as bad as the scientists because everyone is either a 'mosher' or a 'dancer'(HxC dancing, I.E. throwing down) If your a mosher, everyone outside the said group is a faggot or a pussy and hear such things as 'You don't f***ing know real music!!' and 'Quit dancing like a fairy and push someone, pussy!' And the same can be said for the dancers: 'You have no idea what the meaning behind hardcore is!' and 'you dumb mosher fags, you look so stupid!'
for all you girls out there who say the men are the worst part of your relationships, that men are dogs.... screw you too.  i'm living proof that no matter how nice or how mean you are to a woman they will always find a way to make you feel like a second rate citizen.  The women in today's society are the real problem, they're only out to satisfy their vagina and they've had people like Oprah, Ellen, Rosie and a host of other single name powerful females tell them it's okay to do so.  It seems that as soon as a man cheats on a woman he's an asshole, but if a woman cheats on a man she's Liberated and Free.    Fuck That.

 if i cheat on a woman it's because the current one i've got is useless in the sack.  If i cheat on her, she's not staying around much longer.  IF a woman cheats on me, it's because i'm an emotional brick and wont talk to her, she'll keep that going as long as she can, get the emotional connect from some tiny dicked tad pole and come home to get fucked silly. Women of this generation are too empowered, or so they think, and they have no idea what to do with all this perceived power.
So I think I may have finally decided what I'd like to actually do for a living in the now-not-so-distant-future.

I've never really known, as other people seem to. I mean everyone as a kid dreams of being say, a football player, a racing driver, an astronaut, a princess(?) or a ludicrously good-looking actor/famous guy. I'd only be qualified for the last one really. But then I'm not so great at acting, as a recent 'great idea' for a personal media project has proven.

But those things are just silly kid things, no-one in their right mind ever believes that such ideas will ever actually come to fruition, right? I certainly never did anyway. In fact I'd never really even given thought to what I'd be doing when I was older, I was always content to get the heck on with my English homework.Those kinds of careers you kind of have to be born into, or get into by sheer accident. Malcolm Gladwell might disagree with his success = sheer dint of hard work and effort theory, but at the end of the day that's going to be the case 95% of the time.
You never know the person that you see on the street.
You never know the person that is behind or before you in the line at the grocery store.
You never know what the person has gone through, or what they're going through right now.

Sometimes You never even know what's going on in your life.

I'm taking steps.  The steps maybe small, but eventually they will get me a heckuva lot further then I am now.  
I'm taking steps.  I never want to feel "comfortable" where I am, for if I were that way, I would not be in the Geographical State that I'm in.
I'm taking steps.  To reach out and meet new people.

Sometimes You never even know where your life would be if you didn't take that extra step.

So take a step, and see what happens!  (I dare ya!)
so i havent posted anything in a couple of days, not because i've been too busy or too pre-occupied, but  because there's been nothing worth commenting on lately.  the last few days have been very run of the mill and i guess that's a good thing. No emotional ups or downs, nothing stupid at work, nothing crazy at home.  My little minions at work are doing what their told, my big house is empty now, and the emptiness brings quiet, i like the quiet.
 i've got a million stories to tell, stories of painting bridges for tuition money, tales of tragic environmental pollution caused at the hands of yours truly. One day i'll tel you about the time i beat the shit out of the guy who was fucking my fiance, he was still in my house AND naked, that's one for the ages. there are the nights on the road playing in night clubs smaller than my living room, then fucking every vag in the place. There are days that bring the evil stench of the bottom feeders of society to the surface just for a glimpse of what "real life" is like only to push them back to the recesses of society's mind hoping to forget about them.
 yeah i've taken some writers liberties with some of my stories already, that's what i do, i'm a self centered ego star, I feel i am larger than life, so i make my stories larger than life!  as you read these, remember that i will probably not go down in history as the greatest storyteller in history, but i will go down on your little sister, and probably your wife. Look out guys, i'm cumming on what's yours.
Well it's that time again!  Time for me to come up with another excuse as to why I have nothing to show you all.
This week, it is simply that I have been too busy with work (as in trying to make money while unemployed), and research.  The research here is actually more important than that of simply drawing and animating, which is why I have not finished anything this week.  I have paid the DAVE school (that's "Digital Animation & Visual Effects School" for those who haven't heard) down in Orlando Florida, a little visit.
Upon checking into our hotel room, we called one of the DAVE school representatives, who happens to also be a 3rd block student, I'll go into blocks a little more later.  He was kind enough to pick us up, drive us around town a little, give us a tour of the school, and answer some of our questions.
DAVE school is located on the back side of Universal Studios Orlando, on the premises.  It is not inside the gate to the back of the park, but it is on their back lot.  While they are on Universal's property, they are not owned by Universal but have a good relationship with them.  Students get employee-like passes to let them into the back side of the park, where they can go on rides, enjoy the shows, or even eat in the staff cafeteria, which I am told has VERY reasonable prices.  Fun aside, the school is currently in a sound stage which they converted for teaching classes.  Despite this, it is decently equipped, with a mocap (motion capture) studio, green screen, small theater, and dozens of work stations.  The front room is the entry where their receptionist can help with anything you need.  Next to this is the guest lounge, where they show off all the movies, posters, toys, et al that they have made.  They also have an impressive collection of student awards on display.
In a way, this line-up parallels the one in that featured Shannon, Ana-Lucia, and Libby. Both Shannon and Nikki were self-motivated sexpots whose deaths were probably not widely grieved by viewers. Both Libby and Charlotte were brainy but mysterious women whose sudden deaths gave reason for their dorky male admirers to grieve. And both Ana-Lucia and Ilana are hard-hitting women who use violence to enforce their authority. Seeing as how Ilana is the only one on the list still breathing, she’s not exactly in the best of company. Let’s hope she fares better than her season two analogue.
Hi this is Fred.
Hi can I have towels please?
What?
Can you transfer me to towels please?
You have the wrong number.
This isn’t Bed Bath and Beyond?
No you idiot face, I’m playing a prank on you. You know us folk in the bedding department, always screwing with the guys in towels. What the hell do you think?!
Did they think my dad misheard them?
Oh TOWELS. I thought you said trowels, and I was thinking to myself, man, we don’t sell any shovels.
You’d think the wrong number would result in more hilarity and less anger and frustration. People always end the calls so abruptly. As though I am going to keep them on the phone just to make fun of them.
Like my friend Julie who got a call from some guy freshman year looking to rectify problems with his girlfriend. Julie was not his girlfriend but after hanging up and trying to call his actual girlfriend only to get her voicemail, he called Julie back to ask for his advice.
Perhaps he was a womanizer of wrong misdials; perhaps he liked the sound of her voice. We all found it quite strange that he called her back for relationship advice. Perhaps he didn’t have any friends of his own. Maybe he really needed a (very) impartial third party to help solve his problem. Maybe he was really in a bind.
This must have been the thing because he called her back a third time to ask some follow up questions. And Julie, bless her heart, stayed on to chat with him to humor him and engage in a story. She really commits to the fun. And it was her thought process that I channeled recently when I had a similar scenario pop up in my own life.
And not just for porn! Somehow I've either got a nasty, nasty infection or a hellacious mold allergy. Either one is possible. I woke up this morning feeling like death warmed over. No alarm - just a vast vat of uck to bring me to.

I have classes to teach. Ugh.

Blackboard to the rescue! Thanks to the power of the internet and telecommuting, I was able to teach my classes over chat rather than hauling my carcass in to infect the world. Rather than limiting the discussion hosting class over chat liberates it. Rather than getting disrupted by giggles and snores, we're able to focus on content rather than setting.

I'm definitely going to incorporate this fully into my classes next semester.
The volume of marketing content might not be the problem. For a lot of entrepreneurs, the problem is that they need to do more effective online marketing. The de facto practice has been to generate cheap, keyword-rich articles and hope that drives traffic to their site, but that's as far as they've considered. If a prospect clicks through to the website, there is no clear next step for them to take. Instead, the business owner simply hopes that the prospect will call or follow or subscribe.
A friend of mine bought a puppy. It ran around with the kind of wet nosed, furry coated, and playful disposition that is really quite endearing. So of course (like a sucker) I said yes when he approached me with the opportunity of selling the little guy. He couldn't rightly keep him locked up alone in his house while he was gone all day. And frankly I was looking for a friend who was good at listening, and not so good at talking. Some of the training him not to poop in my house was a bit of pain, but we've long since left those things in the past (well at least I hope so).

However my furry friend has developed a bit of a desire to explore. Lately he's been heading over to the neighbors which, where I live, is a bit of a distance. He has all the room in the world out here. I don't mind if he's out exploring several miles away (he knows where home is). But I'm just not that crazy about him bothering the neighbors. Although their little daughter loves him to death and begins chanting his name when he's around.

Today I decided to give the "ok" for my friend to tie a couple of tin cans to his tail. And of course as soon as the deed was done he took off running. He ran around their yard some (spooked their cattle a little) and then hid somewhere. By the time I decided to come and call for him he was yelping as if someone had hit him, and he dove into my truck ready to get home. Panting and all excited he just sat there and looked at me with eyes that spoke of a hard day.
chucky's hindsight'
They say, 'time creates a man into a being full of knowledge and wisdom….or stuff him full of shit and more shit.' that being said, I like to think as I approach 34 years of age (12/06) that I am now a man being filled with knowledge and wisdom. Though, I have no problem admitting that I was once full of shit (lol) and blame my ignorant ideologies at the time on my fallacious past ways. 
Now, I just write letters, articles and books - and do enjoy meeting new people from all over the United States and the entire world. Meeting new people gives me a valuable lesson on life and its principles that go unnoticed more than not.
My life journey at present and my hope is that I can encourage the youth of today - to whom society has rendered neglect upon - and steer them straight - into a land of equal opportunity based on legal activity, hard work, and a keen mind. Education is power. Knowledge is wealth. I want the youth of all the trailer parks, projects, slums, and shelters to know that going to school will pay off in the long run. You can make it with diligence, self-perseverance and a prayer to God, to whom all things become a reality. 


I want to use my current situational debacle to prove that crime does not pay. The 'temporal high' isn't worth one's entire life. Education is the real 'meal ticket!'

That would be Sadie, the chinchilla.  So adorable, and soooo soft.  She was a little ball of crazy energy.
Sunday morning Robb and I planned to go to church, so we got up at 8:30, realized it was actually 9:30, and went back to bed.  I hate rushing to get ready in the morning.  It puts me in a bad mood.  So I just decided we would skip church entirely.  Well...we slept until 11:45.  I hadn't slept well in almost a week, so it was a nice change.  And then I rushed to get ready for my writer's group, which was having a special meeting. 
I drew this confused cat bird...sort of a way for me to sort out my feelings about a friend of mine who is newly transgendered.  It's really hard to stop calling him Ian and start calling her Elaine...and the pronouns...oh, the pronouns!  I'll get it right one day.
So...after a full day, Robb and I ordered pizza.  I hadn't eaten all day, so we finished the whole thing.  That night, I had the happiest dream ever!  I got a pygmy hippo as a pet, and he LOVED cat food and potatoes.  So freaking adorable I could spit!
And this morning?
I appreciate you stopping by to sample a bit of my world behind the camera. I have been very blessed to have had the opportunity to travel and see many great things. During those travels I took many common photos of a far away land that opened my eyes to the common things we see everyday here in the midwestern USA.
I decided that these local common things were very worthy of my photographic attention. I have deliberately sought to pay more attention to my surroundings. Many call that "stopping to smell the roses". I have found that to be good therapy.
This website records many strange events or happenings. It explores wild abstract color and different ways to view things. I have always enjoyed intense contrast in photography. To me, color splashed everywhere is great ... sometimes even enjoyable pushed to the bizarre with manipulation programs.

Interested in having something photographed? Send your inquiries to nikonsniperguy@aol.com. I just might hop in the car and get it done.

Thanks for coming. I enjoy your comments and hearing how a photo strikes you. All the best
Another reason in my opinion is that beginning in the fifties many people started to confuse Homosexuals with
Pedophiles. People not only got the "gays are sinners" message but also the "eww you disgusting perverts" message. It also didn’t help that Homosexuality was listed as a mental health disorder(they thought it was a defect in the brain like schizophrenia, or Bi polar) till like sometime in the nineties. so up until the middle of the 1990s we had all these arrogant idiots telling people to hate us.
And the cause of it all? LACK OF EDUCATION!!!
It seems like such a simple thing right?
Guess not because people still refuse to educate themselves about homosexuality before forming an opinion.
Now granted things are a lot better, in Canada we can marry, there are numerous programs in the city where we can get help, counselling, and hang out with others like us, pride celebrations are in most cities now a days, and most peoples attitudes are better than they used to be. It's just that the people whose attitudes haven't changed that is keeping us back from achieving a better life for gays everywhere. The only thing it would take is education in the schools about homosexuals and homosexuality and I think that slowly attitudes would change. Also an absolute no nonsense policy on homophobic remarks and bullying.
Now if I haven't completely bored you and your still reading I hope u have enjoyed my rantings.
I could have used that quote last week for blogophilia, but I was unable to comply.

I've written over the years of the stupidity of my customers.  This one I think has to take it all...ya know I've said it before, I thought I've seen it all, but NOPE!

I unexpectedly had to work 14 1/2 hours the other day, and thus being the graveyard shift the lobby wasn't open.  A guy from da "Hood" came to the window and bought a cigarillo, a lighter, and payed for his gasoline.  So I'm watching him.  He's pumping gas and lights up the fricken cigar!  Over the intercom I told him, put it out or I'll stop the pump...He put it out...stupid moron!

I'm pretty much back to almost 40 hours a week...(I'm a happy camper)  But to get the five days in I need to work at another store...the clientelle are totally different then da HOOD peeps.  It's in an industrial area, and the majority of the customers are business people.  Nice, friendly, just want to get their stuff and git outta dodge!

Back at the regular place, I have people constantly ask me..."do you sell milk?"  And I answer...ummm, yes, it's where the sign says COW!

Maybe this little blog'll get my creative juices flowing, my Muse divorced me the past couple of weeks, so maybe I'll have to "court" her and make nicey nicey, 'cuz I really don't like not writing...oh, plus my camera crapped out again!...so it's cell phone pics until I get it fixed...I was smart enough to buy "Insurance" this time...will just take a couple of days to get it back.

So I think the two best Dumb Awards in Da Hood should go to the chick that gave me half a dollar bill and asked if that was worth 50 cents...and actually MEANT it!...and then the dumba$$ that lit up while pumping gas.

Got any better one's then that?

My friend Jasyn recently posted this on my last blog, first time I had seen it and I love it now.  I wanted to share it with you.  Whoever put this together did a great job, I've watched 2 other videos in the series and this one is the best in my opinion.
    I was excited to show it to my oldest son, who is 4 and loves both science and music, and he really liked it.  We got to go over who each of the people were, what they studied, had accomplished, and what they were saying.  He has wanted to be an astronaut since before he could talk and has always loved science.  He was most amazed that the guy said that scientists love not knowing.  "Don't scientists know everything?" he asked.  "No", I replied, "and that is why they are scientists". 

My favorite quote was by Neil deGrasse Tyson:
"When you are scientifically literate, the world looks very different to you, and that understanding empowers you".
So empower yourself.  Study.  Learn.  Question.  Repeat.
My son told me the other day, "Dad, I'm a scientist, AND an expert, AND...." his voice got real soft for emphasis... "a real ninja!"

Expert ninja scientists, however, is another topic for another blog.  Don't want to blow your mind here or anything.

Peace!

I try to work hard - enough to keep my wife, Bria at home, so she can take the best care of our two kids, Rhys and Ammie. I love my job. Seriously. I like to help people with what I can. I enjoy good discussions, great jokes, well-written scripts in movies with good acting and directing. I have a great appreciation for the little things that make me smile; cold beer, pizza, lasagne, sunshine, summer, anything non-winter, shiny power tools, green forests, fishing, camping, good loud music, people who are honest and loyal, The One Real God (not the sadly perverted gospel of convenience you hear about in so many "churches" these days), and basically anything having to do with meat and melted cheese together in a steamy, mouth-watering au-pair.My wife has a much more "commercially successful" blog. Because I rarely post, and she frequently does, I've decided to stop crowding the internet with my use of valuable space here, and nest my bitter rants and biting sattire within her quaint and uplifting Wordpress site.
About a month ago or so I went on trek to Sinhagar fort near Pune. I was so excited about the trek (as usual) because I had heard so much about the place. But I couldn’t make it to the fort in last five years. Well in retrospect, I must say that it was good that I didn’t go visit the place. WHY? Okay. Let me be sure that you are asking me why I think so? Please have a look at the following pictures.


But at the same time I am ashamed to share these pictures with you all. Shivaji Maharaj – a name every Indian feels proud to be associated with, one of the most clever emperors in Indian history – had never thought of this kind of treatment to his picture that too in his own territory. Well, I don’t want to exaggerate it any further. Just have a look and let me know your opinion about it.
Last night, Sofia and I saw The Lightning Thief at midnight. For those who don't know, this movie is based on the book of the same name, about a character named Percy Jackson who learns that he is a demigod: half human, half Greek god. Sofia has loved the series of books for nearly five years. If you remember back to my blog last summer, I waited in line for two hours to get the author's autograph, since Sofia was in Costa Rica. She's crazy for the books.

So it was only fitting that we go see the movie as soon as any non-theater employee/industry insider possibly could.

Sofia didn't have school Friday, but I did. So I purposefully fell asleep when I lay down with Bella and Alex, and then woke up around 10:30 to get ready to go. Sofia also took a bit of a nap.

We dressed, drove to the theater, got our popcorn and drinks, and found the perfect seat. The showing wasn't a sell-out, but it was pretty full.

So now, for those interested, I present my review of The Lightning Thief. I'm always sensitive to spoilers, so when I get into spoiler territory, I'll change the color to almost match the background. If you don't want to read it, just skip it. But if you want to read them, click and drag your mouse across them and read them while they're highlighted.

I haven't read a single review of the film yet, so I want to get my two cents posted before I check out what the critics are saying. I've read all the books, so my opinion will obviously be flavored with that perspective, but I'm not one of those people who hates when movies change the storyline or details. I know adapting a book to a movie is a bit of an art form in and of itself. I'm cool with that, as long as it's done well.
The Wind In The Willows' is one of my favourite children's books but i always felt that Kenneth Grahame failed to give us sufficient closure. Sure Mr Toad escaped prison and won back Toad Hall but what was his life like after the experience of prison?

'Well Mr Toad may i just say that you've impressed us very much in the interview stage and i think you'll be hearing from us very soon'
"oh that's fantastic. thank you"
"We've just got to ask you a few standard questions"
"Sure, go ahead"
"have you got any previous criminal convictions?"
"ummmm i do actually, but it was a long time ago and i can promise you that i've changed"
"ok, what was the conviction for?"
"umm well it's convictionS actually. One was for stealing a car, after which i proceeded to shout stuff at people while speeding past."
(Mr Toad has a real compulsion to always tell the truth since he found God)
"ok well that shouldn't...."
"...and i killed a man"

Yeah Mr Toad killed a man years before the grand theft auto incident. Well by man he means shrew because in this sick world that Kenneth Grahame created where moles converse with badgers, a man's life is worth the same as a shrews.
Not only did i get up first today, but i actually drove the car too!!! I’m not as against driving as i used to be - i wouldn’t say i enjoy it, but i’m happy enough to do it. The main reason for me not having driven up till today is two fold - firstly i’ve not driven this particular car (we are in Sally’s company Ford Focus), and secondly, i am better at navigating, so Sally would rather we sat on our usual sides of the car.

Because we were going to places that we knew fairly well today, i offered to drive, and my offer was taken up.

We had some rain overnight - not too much, but enough to dampen everywhere, and it was still trying to drizzle as we set off for Bamburgh, this time to check out the town itself. Well, i guess that village would be a better description, as it is very small indeed. There is a RNLI gift shop with museum, a couple of gift shops, tea rooms, pubs and hotels, and that’s about your lot. We selected the “Copper Kettle” tea room, and entered the old, wooden beamed cottage and stepped back in time.

Although the building has been there for centuries (originally built to house labourers for the castle) it has only been a tea room for about half a century. Two spinster sisters bought the property and spent a fortune on turning it into the tea room. (The last page of the menu gives a potted history). They bought the building for £8000, but spent £13,000 on the wooden panelling inside alone!!!!

Just like our holiday to Wales last June, it was only on the last day that we found a cream tea! We each had one of their wonderful cream teas, with two lovely warm scones, jam, whipped cream, and a large pot of tea between us. It was heavenly!
Work progress on little Winslow. I was thinking about yesterdays post, and my comment of doing something more NY. I think this painting captures some of what I was doing while in NY and the chair figures more into what I've been doing in OR.

It's not a good thing or a bad thing, it's just what's happening in my work. Back in NY, I doubt I would have thought to include the chair, here in OR, I struggled to leave any of the background out. I think because I've been painting so many environmental portraits in the past few years, it's how I'm seeing the world. I also love the feel of Don's studio where the picture was taken.

Winslow is so much more than Don's studio companion and to paint him set in the studio leaves out part of the story. Painting him with only the chair makes the viewer wonder more about Winslow the dog than Winslow the studio dog. Plus, people will wonder "What is that chair doing in this painting?"
So....I still come around here once in a while.  I read a blog or two.  I rarely leave comments anymore.  It's because I am real busy and self-important, dontchya know!

I have just been swimming in busy'ness. Treading may be more accurate.  OK....swimming sounds like I'm going somewhere.  Treading might not be progressive, but still sounds athletic.  I guess bobbing in busy'ness would be more apt.

My job has taken over my life.  Don't get me wrong.  I love my job.  Egotistically, I even sometimes think I'm kinda good at it.  I didn't acknowledge it (I think I realized it a while ago) until tonight.

I read Misha's blog about her daughter and her sense of wonderment.  It made me smile.  I remember some of the conversations that I have had with Misha and some of the blogs those conversations birthed.  I look back, and compared to now, my life was shit.  We talked about bridges, and love, and Terebithia and I wrote about Hank and Phil, and HER and kicking dirt with my bare feet, and about boobs and poop and such.

I guess I post blogs when I need the catharsis of producing a gigantic mass of emotion, turmoil, angst, wonderment, joy, anger and the like.  I felt that urge tonight....then the kids started fighting.....and all that I could produce was a proverbial wet fart.

Today, as I said, life is busy, and from other's expectations good.  There are the daily grind headaches.  And no time for the heartaches.  I kinda miss the heartaches, and the wonderment that they brought.

This made no sense whatsoever......

Anyway.....have a good night.  The headaches come early when they start at 530....

Later

I didn't really have a good title to my post, so I decided to massacre the title of one of my favorite Star Wars books.
As you may have noticed, it has been more than a month since my last post. I had some intentions of updating my blog shortly after I returned from school, but I have not gotten around to it until today. The last month of school did indeed go well. I gave all my reports and took all my tests. I got pretty good grades on the stuff that I did and now I am glad that I have to do no more of said assignments until the end of August. 
This past month I have been reading and playing video games. Pretty good summer so far. I know, in your mind you are saying, "What, this bum hasn't yet gotten a job?" To that I say, "I'm too pretty to work!" Well, actually, as y'all might have noticed, the job market is not extremely good right now. There is very little work in Pahrump, and even were a position to open up, it's tough because I know that there are a number of guys and gals in the church who need jobs to support families. If anything opens up, I'll probably let you know, but until then, it's helping out in the new building at the church and reading books.
I've written before about how I'm now at the age where I've become part of an obvious "targeted demographic" when it comes to television commercials and advertisements. Being in my mid-40's I am in prime shape to be taken in by ads that promise everything from being able to re-grow hair to being able to "be ready" for up to 36 hours, should I choose to become intimate with someone.
Now that's how to play up and at 'em without breaking players legs. If Pulis watched the Chelsea-Inter game tonight he should have taken notes.

Inter were all over Chelsea from the off. They wanted the game so much more than Chelsea and the hard work paid off. Chelsea played as if they expected to be gifted a dramatic late winner and Drogba got all stroppy when it didn't happen. Fantastic.

Yes Inter's tactics at defending corners were far from savoury but they got away with it and it made me laugh to see John Terry kicking off for no apparent reason other than that his team had lost at the final whistle. Haha-de-ha.

That aside I was bored throughout. The first leg was dull enough and there were 3 goals mixed in there. Tonight Inter's defence were solid once again and Mourinho admitted to celebrating wildly with his players in the dressing room. Fair enough. Ancelotti said before the game that he'd have a glass of wine with Mourinho post-match. Quite whether that will happen remains to be seen but I can't imagine Ancelotti will want to talk football if they do. After Eto'o scored Inter's winner (a goal that won me over £60- cheers Samuel!) the camera cut to Ancelotti and you could almost see the lemon juice trickling down his chin.
I was just shaken awake by what I thought was someone grabbing the bottom of my bed and shaking it up and down. I went down the hall to the reception desk at the Comfort Inn in Monterey Park and I looked at the night clerk who is usually asleep and said, Did something just happen? Yes, he replied. That was an earthquake.
I went back to my room and called Braff Zackton who was already at work in Chicago. Braff ran his earthquake search that he does every 30 minutes and informed me that I just rode a 4.4 in the Greater Los Angeles Area at 4:04am. It seems no one else is alarmed but me! That is completely whack and a first for me.

9:20am update
I just got back from breakfast a few minutes ago. Still no one was talking about this event. It's the most reported event in a while on the Did You Feel It? web site. Rare breed these Californians. It's like ... the whole L-A area got up and went for a drive on the I-5 in a bumpy Rambler Station Wagon at 4am for no reason ... and nobody even talks about it. That is crazy.
I literally thought there was someone in my room picking up the bottom of the bed and clipping it to the lift on a Six Flags grade roller coaster. Isn't there a T-Shirt for this kinda thing?
-----
You might ask ... Why would I would call someone in Chicago about an Earthquake in California? Well, here's a little more background on Braff Zackton you may like to read.
People say that i'm dealing with a lot of anger issues,  I'm hard to get along with and i can't handle when i'm wrong.
 I'd tend to agree. I don't care, but i agree none the less.
 i'm not the easiest to get along with, but only because i've already figured out what works best. If i ask you to do something a certain way, DO IT, don't question me, don't try and figure out a better way to do it, just fucking do it like i said and be done with it.
 I am a total My way or the Highway kind of guy. i'm not angry most of the time, most of the time my disappointment in the way a situation that i have delegated turns out, manifests itself as anger. so i'f i'm appear mad at you, i'm not, i'm profoundly disappointed in the way you've handled yourself.

 My current room mate was once my girlfriend,  up until last month she was my girlfriend, i guess you'd go so far as to put the dreaded " life partner" label on her. we'd been together for years, bought a house have a couple of cars, the whole works.  Last month she decides to mix things up a little bit and go in search of a piece of strange.  when she fessed up to her crime, i was shocked and stunned, but not surprised.  i'm not exactly the picture of prince charming here. I managed to keep my emotions in check, not yell, or scream, or even hit anything.  All i said was " I'm extremely disappointed in you"  That was the last thing i said to her.  We've been co-habitating in this house for the better part of 6 weeks now and haven't said a word to each other. Until this morning.   over coffee, one simple phrase has completely fixed my problem.  " Fuck You"  came out of my mouth.  i'm not sure what's going to happen now, i'm not sure i really care. if she feels the need to suck some dick that's not mine, i'm okay with that. She just wont be living in my house while she's doing it.
