Rush of imagination !  Raman Varman tried to cross a check-post that he crossed daily while going to his office. But he was stopped by a security personnel who said, “Sir, Indians are not supposed to enter through this way. You may take the next turn instead.”
“What do you mean Indians can’t enter. This is India. And it’s a silly check-post and not an international border !”
“You are wrong sir. Do you see that statue there ?”, he said pointing to a far white statue that was crowned and had a torch in its right raised hand.
“You are trying to enter America sir. And you know that the law...”
“Whhhhaaattt...oooo...wow...aaahhaaa...” Raman’s involuntary expressions rose from wonderment to more wonderment before the security-man knocked at the window glass of his car, “You are obstructing the traffic sir!”

Raman woke up in the midnight. He smiled, switched on the light, took his note book and drew a rough sketch of what he saw in the dream, closed the note book, switched off the light, smiled again, and slept.

Raman was a medical representative (MR) and had quit 3 firms earlier all on the same unique ground that MRs should be respected by the company coz they are most crucial in making a deal with docs n hospitals. Al Toro Pharma was his current place of work.

He saw weird things in his dreams and painted the same ASAP before the prints of the imagination became too dull to be transferred to the canvas. One day he dreamt the Qatub Minar just adjacent to Taj Mahal. He was happy to bring entirely 2 rules separated by 300 years too close. He had dreamt the water of Ganga going up the hills. He had rented a hall every inch of which was full of deep non-sense that had originated in his mind in the past. The paintings sell for handsome amount, and Raman soon became a known image in the locality, and quite unlike the SENSEX, the radius of his popularity was on an increase.

He was uni-directionally paranoid the direction being that of his wife from where apart from the routine curses one day came a rotating a screwdriver that just missed Raman’s eyes! Yet he loved her very much coz except few hours in the day she too loved him.
His position in Al Toro became odd when he bought a Volkswagen- a machine that only earned envy for Raman. They say that you can’t but fall prey to the arrows of envy. And Raman was no exception. He decided to quit Al Toro, and establish himself as a full-time painter – a decision not in conformity with his wife’s opinion.

Being a full time painter of weirdness he would force himself to imagine insanities. He begins to avert truth and the general perception of the things. He would rotate his head and try to see the inverted objects only to confuse his mind as to what the reality is. He would try to imagine ordinary objects (like his Parker pen) as an exotic piece of excellence. He would find flaws in everything he saw, and wish if they could be as per his imagination. Surprises, he began to believe, is the most important thing that can keep you away from this general monotony of life. “Surprises”, he said, “is more powerful than happiness ... it keeps you alive !”. His public behaviour has come (declined) a long way - from humour to unwanted humour to objectionable humour to darkness and pity - a behaviour that created a mix of irritation and sympathy in those who confronted him.

One day he dreamt God speaking to him. He painted it being careless about the result. “Is God weird ?”, was a question to be answered. “What Mr Raman want to say through his popular non-sense is that God is weird !”. What Raman painted was a never-before imagination. This made many sectarians ask, “Is this a Hindu God or Allah or Jesus or Buddha or... ”. The point was if it was Allah then it was the sole responsibility of that community to object, and likewise for others.
The defence from Raman was, “God is not weird! It’s his talking to me that is weird. As in many of my paintings, it’s not the absolute objects that are weird, rather it’s their actions are weird...”
But the property of the mob is – it doesn’t listen to arguments if it has once made its mind (if at all that exists anywhere)! The carnival of absurdities (his Hall) was reduced to carnival of ashes (by fundamentalists) as the last amber grew cold. The outcome – it was proved that God is not weird! He protects himself through these agents who would commit all sins, but not hear anything against something in front of which they rotate incense stick in the morning.

Raman did not go out for many days. He kept imagining and drawing on his note-book and oscillating brushes on the canvasses. His deliberate jumping into imagination became his habit, and soon his very character. It became hard for him to distinguish between a real event and a non-real. He would meet many distant people without going out at all! This was different from schizophrenia where you have a finite number of illusions playing around you. It appeared some strange case of hyper-reality, where the brain could deliberately detach itself from even the most known things.

Today he decided to go out of his house and meet his friends at Al Toro and see the Raman Hall. Luckily he found the door of his house open for the first time since many days. He rushed out. Many men asked him to stop. They chased him. But he managed to escape. “God ! The world is getting madder day by day !”, he thought.

He changed his plan, and went to see his hall first. He asked a man nearby, “Sir, there used to be a Raman Hall here. Where is that?”. “Raman Hall? There was no such tower here. This had been a community centre since I saw it for the first time in 1981.” He had misunderstood the building he thought. He came out and inquired about the Hall, but all in vain. It getting dark, he returned to his house.

He entered his house, and surprisingly found that a thick layer of dust had taken the responsibility of protecting everything. He took something from the floor, and removed the dust from some parts. Newspaper. And it showed an edifice. Wait. “I have seen this place...Oh this is where I came out from in the morning. This is my house! ” . He removed dust further and saw himself going into the edifice with some policemen. He could not make out. He cleared all dust. The news read “Raman gets relief. Acquitted on ground of strange disorder. Taken to Protege Asylum.” The body of the news was hardly legible. He was tired. He cleaned a part of the sofa and lay there before he found a dust laden portrait, the garland of which were cocooned by spider webs, on the wall. He cleaned the portrait. It was of Lalitha’s, his wife’s.
