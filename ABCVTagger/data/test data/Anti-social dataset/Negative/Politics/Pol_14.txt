Mr. Hooleyasked the Secretary of State for Education and Science what is the current estimate of the shortage of teachers of mathematics and physics in State schools in England and Wales.
Dr. Boyson: There is no single measure of teacher shortage in a particular subject because schools vary in the time allotted to different subjects in the curriculum, and many teachers teach more than one subject. But the number of unfilled vacancies reported by local education authorities indicates the immediate demand for additional secondary teachers by subject. In January 1981 local education authorities in England and Wales reported 383 unfilled vacancies in mathematics and 151 in physics.
Mr. Andrew F. Bennett asked the Secretary of State for Education and Science how many qualified teachers are not now working as teachers.
Dr. Boyson: About 300,000 qualified teachers in England and Wales under the age of 60 are estimated to be not currently working as teachers.
