chucky's hindsight'
They say, 'time creates a man into a being full of knowledge and wisdomâ€¦.or stuff him full of shit and more shit.' that being said, I like to think as I approach 34 years of age (12/06) that I am now a man being filled with knowledge and wisdom. Though, I have no problem admitting that I was once full of shit (lol) and blame my ignorant ideologies at the time on my fallacious past ways. 
Now, I just write letters, articles and books - and do enjoy meeting new people from all over the United States and the entire world. Meeting new people gives me a valuable lesson on life and its principles that go unnoticed more than not.
My life journey at present and my hope is that I can encourage the youth of today - to whom society has rendered neglect upon - and steer them straight - into a land of equal opportunity based on legal activity, hard work, and a keen mind. Education is power. Knowledge is wealth. I want the youth of all the trailer parks, projects, slums, and shelters to know that going to school will pay off in the long run. You can make it with diligence, self-perseverance and a prayer to God, to whom all things become a reality. 


I want to use my current situational debacle to prove that crime does not pay. The 'temporal high' isn't worth one's entire life. Education is the real 'meal ticket!'
