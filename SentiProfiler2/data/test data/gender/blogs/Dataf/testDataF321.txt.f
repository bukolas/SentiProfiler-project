It was suggested by a close friend that I add Google AdSense to the blog and then donate the proceeds to a Farm to School initiative or another group. I'm getting enough traffic here that I could raise a couple hundred dollars per month just based upon people landing on the site (clicking not required). Although I like the idea of donating to a worthy cause, I don't feel comfortable adding ads to the blog. To me having ads undermines the whole point of what I'm doing as an individual to raise awareness. On the other hand, giving money to something that does agree with the tenets of the blog is appealing. But then who would I choose and should I rotate on a monthly basis to various agencies.... I'd like to have a "show of hands" of my readership so I'm going to add a poll to the right-hand side of the blog. You are welcome to comment as well.
