2009 G-20 London Summit

The 2009 G-20 London Summit is the second meeting of the G-20 heads of state in discussion of financial markets and the world economy, which was held in London on 2 April 2009 at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre.[1] It followed the first G-20 Leaders Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy, which was held in Washington, D.C. on 14–15 November 2008.[2] Heads of government or heads of state from the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G-20), plus some regional and international organisations attended. Due to the extended membership it has been referred to as the London Summit.[3]

The policing tactics at the event raised some controversy, particularly over the death of Ian Tomlinson.
