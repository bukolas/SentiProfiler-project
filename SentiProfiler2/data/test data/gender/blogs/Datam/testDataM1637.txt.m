First group of onions planted...

Sudarshan Suryawanshi - IDE India - Drip Irrigation Expert - visited our farm yesterday...
Sudarshan said we are doing better with the IDE Drip Irrigation systems than the two major Agri Universities in Honduras...
We held our first meeting of Honduran Campesino farmers at our Center of Operations...

We are receiving reports of how there are those who hold top positions as Agri directors for major Honduran NGO´S...
Who do not want the IDE systems at our farm...
Hah!
You will not stop our work...

I have said for years...
The help must go directly to the organized Honduran Campesinos...
Most of the Agricultural NGO´s in Hondurans are dinosaur institutions...
Who only promote sustainable famine projects...
