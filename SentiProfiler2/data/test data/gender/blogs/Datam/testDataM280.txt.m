Y'know, listening to this and thinking back...it doesn't strike me that Alexandra Burke - a self-confessed fan of the badder boy - would be at all pleased if she bought a new dress and her fella failed to notice, would she?

I mean come on, she's a pop star. She went on a TV talent show in order to get constant feedback and praise from the British public every week. The very least she is going to expect from a man is the ability to tell her she looks hot in her new frock. That need for attention drives her every move, as it does for everyone.

Heck, even bad boys like Skepta do what they do partly because they're not supposed to and it makes people look. Or at least, they SAY they do the things they do because of that. There is a difference.

(Here's the video. Oh so THAT'S why they call you a bad boy.)

The key to talking about how much of a scallywag you are and making it appealing for everyone to listen to lies in how much fun you can make it sound. You have to know that what you're doing is not very nice, and kind of half-laugh at how ridiculous you are. It's a skill, and luckily Skepta is very much the man for the job.

Listen to him brag about treating his woman poorly. Does he sound sad about it? No. But does he sound like he thinks she deserves to be treated this way? Also no. This is very important. He kind of gets off on the fact that he's a rotten swine, but at least he knows right from wrong, and as most of it is relayed from her perspective, it's not like her feelings are being totally dismissed.

That said, "I know she knows I know she ain't the one" is pretty harsh. *disapproving fingerwag*

Also, this scores with me because it owes a sonic debt to Underworld's 'Born Slippy', in the chorus. That's always a good thing, but don't tell Skapta, he'll only change it or something, the shameless rogue.
