There are currently... let's see... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, maybe 10 persons (and that's without their affiliated persons) the thoughts of whom upset me in one way or another. With 6-7 or them it's really bad. With two of them it's decidedly painful. Rejection, deceit, jealousy, unrequited love, hopeless mutual love, loss, misunderstandings, conflict, hurtful words, unanswered questions, ignored requests, longing, regrets, uncertainty, anger, blame, self-questioning, guilt, unfulfilled desire, disregarded feelings, inability to understand... Keeping my thoughts away from them is exhausting. I need a place to rest my thoughts.
