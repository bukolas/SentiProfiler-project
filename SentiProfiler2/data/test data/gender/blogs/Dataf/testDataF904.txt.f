So I have had a few people who are on my page that I don't know all that well ask me if my relatives were the founders of the town I live in....LOL No! 

My first husband's last name is Powell and he and I have three kids together, so I felt it was important for me to hyphenate my last name to add their name. The social security office told me I have every legal right to continue to use Powell as my last name, or part of my last name, so I feel like as long as three out of my seven children have a different last name then I do now, I should find a way to be able to use both names. So I legally changed it to Powell-Sanschargrin, Sanschargrin being my married name now. My maiden name is only used on Facebook.

Now, what a huge coincidence that Mark and I happened to buy a house and settle in a town that is called Powell! When we decided to buy a house in the Knoxville area and we were looking at houses on-line when we were in Italy, I seen this town and laughed! I made the comment to Mark, and I was totally joking when I said it, "We should buy a house in that town!" Wouldn't you know that our real estate agent had a bunch of houses in this area to show us and we really did end up buying our home here! Everyone joked about it...My oldest daughter said she couldn't believe I ended up in a town called Powell... But we love it:)

So there you have it! I was not related to the settlers of our small town. As a matter of fact, I know absolutely nothing about this town or how it even got it's name or when it was founded. The odds of me ending up in a town that happens to share the same name with my ex-husband, I'm a little bit curious about that.
