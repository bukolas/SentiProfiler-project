As we entered Farmerbrown, the place was packed so we had to wait to be seated. I scanned the place and I could tell that the dimly lit restaurant was cozy enough. It has a charm that I couldnâ€™t describe much in words. Jazz music filled the air that balanced the chatter, which could be heard by the bar where friends and strangers meet up. Near the tall glass window, families were having a reunion of sort. In the middle and at the other side of the restaurant, the ambiance was a bit subdued, where couples and small groups were enjoying their dinner quietly.
