On 10th December, 1831, Sahuayo was finally recognised as a legl entity. Throughout the reform age it was a refuge for conservative forces until 1861. At this time the owner of the Hacienda de Guaracha, Dona Anotonia Moreno, sold half the land to over 50 rich buyers. Shortly afterwards the Second French Empire began their invasion of Mexico led by Napolean III in an attempt to force the Mexicans to settle their debts to France, Spain and Britain who, until 1861, had been receiving interest Sahuayo payments from Mexico.Sahuayo and the neighbouring towns faced raids from both sides. On 13th April 1891 Sahuayo changed its name to Sahuayo de Porfirio Diaz after the then president of Mexico and the town was elevated to the status of villa.
