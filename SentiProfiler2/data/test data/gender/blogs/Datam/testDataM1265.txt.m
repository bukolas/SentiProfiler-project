The new tax will not be an "insurance fund" for the banking industry, as ministers are concerned that such a measure would simply encourage more risky behaviour of the sort that led to the financial crisis of 2008. Instead resolution agreements (also known as living wills) will mean banks will be forced to break up should they ever fail again.

"We do not see the point of creating a mega-fund to prepare for another banking failure," said one well-placed source. "We do think that where people are creating risk for the tax payer they should be taxed accordingly. "It will be similar to pollution taxes on industry to discourage damage to the environment."

The International Monetary Fund will report next month on how the global community should respond to the need to control systemic risk in the financial system. It is believed that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, will broadly welcome plans for extra taxes on banking's riskier activities.

Treasury officials said that Britain would not "go it alone" on the new tax, and that it was likely there would be agreement on similar tax regimes across the world.

The news comes after David Cameron, the leader of the Opposition, announced that the Conservatives would be willing to act unilaterally on an international banking tax if there was no global
agreement.

Tory sources said, though, it was unlikely they would have to, given signals from the G20. President Obama has said that he supports new levies on banking in America.

The UK banking lobby has warned that any tax on banks must not undermine attempts to resuscitate the economy.

Responding to Mr Cameron's speech yesterday, a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: "UK banks have already made changes to how they are structured and the amount of capital and cash they hold to help prevent any future problems.

"We believe any further reforms need to be timely, considered and internationally co-ordinated so they do not restrict credit to individuals and businesses as recovery picks up speed.

"Taxpayer intervention to stabilise the UK banking industry is on track to be paid back. And we will work with everyone on issues around a last-resort intervention fund – as well as other means to protect the taxpayer should a problem arise in the future.But UK banks believe the best course is to wait for the outcome of next month's IMF proposals."

Mr Cameron announced the measures while speaking to supporters in Putney, south-west London.

He said: "This is no time to shy away from confronting some of the biggest vested interests in our country – the banks. We had the biggest bank bail-out in the world. We can't just carry on as if nothing happened."

Referring to President Obama's plans to recover funds used to bail out US banks, he said: "Why should it be any different here? A Conservative government will introduce a new bank levy to pay back tax payers and to protect them in the future.

"It won't be popular in every part of the City. But I believe it's fair and it's necessary."
