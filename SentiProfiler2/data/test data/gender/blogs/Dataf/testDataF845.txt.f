The dogs have been in and out all morning, but for the most part are playing indoors as we all watch the snow falling - pretty, like falling snow should be.

We still don't have much furniture in our living/dining room, which makes it a fun playroom with its slick wood laminate floor. They all love tossing and running after their balls.

Every once in awhile I have to get up and help retrieve a ball that has rolled under the computer desk or behind the oak dining chairs against the wall, in line to be repaired. The last time I was assisting Chelsea and Harley over in the far corner, I picked up the folded vinyl tablecloth that had been knocked off a box, and then gathered up the gauzy curtains that had slithered off a chair.
 
"Sorry, babies, I don't see your ball anywhere down here," I sympathized, and started back across the room to my desk. 

On one of the futon chairs in front of the TV table lay Frankie, relaxing for a change and calmly watching the other dogs as they searched high and low. He rested his chin on one big front paw, stretching the other paw out beside him, guarding not one, but two small rubber balls.
 
We made eye contact as I passed by, and the sparkle of amusement was unmistakable.

That boy!
