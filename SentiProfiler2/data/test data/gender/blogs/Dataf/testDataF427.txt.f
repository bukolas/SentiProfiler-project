You may be thinking "Oh I would never do that", unfortunately you probably do to some extent. If you've ever bought a woman a drink, flowers, chocolates, taken her out to a lavish dinner in order to get her to like you (as in you weren't in a relationship yet and she's not in love with you, your doing these things to get her to like you more). Then you're putting her on a pedestal. Yes you can do these things for her once you're in a relationship and she's already in love with you, but never do them when you're still dating and you're trying to get her attracted to you. This just screams out "Hey I don't deserve a woman of your beauty, but I'm willing to bribe you with expensive things to make up for that"
